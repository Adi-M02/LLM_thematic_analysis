Stolen thousands of dollars from my family and former employers. Have almost 15 days clean now and I notice recovery has been getting harder and harder for me the more i relapse. \n\nAlso I know many other addicts some of whom have progressed very deep into addiction and every time those ones try to get clean it never lasts.  For example, my one friend has been shooting heroin & coke for over 7 years. He has been to 9 rehabs always relapsing within 3 months after his release. He has also been arrested 4 times, the most recent arrest was for robbing a convenience store with an illegal handgun. He was caught 2 weeks later and served around 1 year 8 months. I feel he has progressed to far for recovery to ever work.\n\nLets face it addiction changes you. It changes your personality, your chemical balances in your brain, your values, your norms. How does an addict get back to having good values when addiction stripped them away? Your thoughts are welcomed.

{"text": "So the other day I was listening to the radio in NJ. This woman came on who was spreading news about this proposed law she is lobbying with Legislators to pass. Its called Sabrina's Law (named after her daughter who OD'd & died on dope). The law would allow concerned family and friends of addicts to contact courts in order to get the addict committed to a rehab facility. So in other words, the court system can mandate people to rehabs regardless of whether or not you have committed a crime. All they need is a testimony from a family member or friend that confirms the person's addiction problem. Sabrina's mother said the thinking behind this law is that \"when people are using drugs they can't make good decisions, so lets enable families and courts to make the decision for them and get them the help they need sooner.\" \n\n\nIdk about you guys but I oppose this legislation. I support addicts getting help and going to treatment but you can't always force them to. Every addict has their own process and progression, they need to get to the point of desperation where they'll have a genuine desire for recovery. If you commit addicts to rehabs when they aren't ready that will only foster animosity between the addict and family. I thought this was an issue worth discussing. Also I don't support involving the government more and more in peoples recovery....we already have drug court isn't that enough?

{"text": "Hey reddit, I have four months clean today. These four months have been the hardest I've ever worked in my entire life. I've never had this amount of clean time ever. The longest I used to have was 39 days and the entire time I was white knuckling and just trying to get some cash together to go out and do what I did best. What made me want to change for the better was being in the ER after almost over dosing on heroin and acting very belligerent towards my mom. To this day I still have no idea what I said or did that caused her to call the cops. She went to the ER later that day because I was almost 51/50, I have a long history with mental illness and a year and a half ago I was diagnosed bipolar. She took my phone, cash, and told me that I was on my own and that our family did not want to do anything with me if I was still using. I had been alone, I ran away and went hitchhiking a few times and always came back. What she said really struck home and I knew that I had to do better. Since then I got my car back, some freedom, and I currently have a 4.0 in college.Because of my different illnesses I've decided that I want to help people and I'm going to school to be a psychologist.

I have been doing hot baths/shower, serious stretching before bed, trying not to eat anything as sometimes caffeine and sugar can make it worse.  Benadryl makes it much worse for me, don't have access to Benzos, and melatonin has also made it worse for me in the past.\n\nThanks all keep on keeping on!\n\nPS: Got in the car last night, turned on the radio and heard \"I wish I knew you when I was young, could have got sooo high\"  I thought it was rather apropos  for my current situation\n\nStay strong everyone!

I've been a Redditor for some time under various account names and an opiate *enthusiast* for going on ten years.\n\nIt only just occurred to me today to visit r/heroin, which (surprise, surprise) is a ghost town. A post there mentioned r/opiates and here I am, happy to see a small but active and caring community of like-minded and varied Redditors.\n\nSo Hi!\n\nSeparately - after having done some reading here I am fairly certain that the gear we've been getting here in Scotland is cut with Fentanyl. A slightly alien yet heavy rush, which at first seems to suggest I am in for a lengthy and perhaps dangerous nod, which then wears off quite quickly leaving a mediocre high for the remainder.\n\nFentanyl? Check. But here's the thing - the gear is very hard, takes a lot - I mean **a lot** of acid to break down and bubbles as a very thick, opaque mixture before settling into a combined sediment / translucent golden liquid. The more acid - the less sediment.\n\nWhat is going on with this kit? Has anyone seen anything similar and maybe know what's going on here?\n\nIt's the strongest stuff we've had in years but isn't strong in the way I remember the good stuff hitting.\n\nThanks r/opiates. Once again, pleased to join you all.\n\n-nobu_oKo_jima-\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit - at some point the sediment stops dissolving. I can't keep adding acid and be rid of it all. Hello r/opiates.

{"text": "Hey guys, long story short, last September I went to rehab, ended up staying clean for 8 months, and relapsed in June and been using for two months (rehab is no longer an option because I know longer have insurance). This is my second attempt at getting clean since relapsing (actually had a post on her about it but unfortunately failed but I'll keep on getting back up). So far I made it about two and a half days, last dose was Wednesday afternoon. I actually caved Friday morning and went to my guy and ended getting beat, the bags were 95% percent cut, I was just as sick after snorting it as I was before the fact. To be honest with you I was never so happy to get beat because now I no longer have a source since he was my only guy and I was a loner stoner so I don't know anyone else that uses. It was like God did this to me to tell me to fucking stop it lol, seriously. So I am basically going to go through it this time and need some support from you guys again to get through it. It's Saturday morning and I go back to work Monday and I doubt I'll be up for it but I have to go eithier way, it's going to be physically and emotionally challenging. The only good this is that I have a 4 day weekend coming up Friday-Monday. I really need your guys help to get through this work week sick and not able to sleep. Thanks guys.

{"text": "I think that for most, the physical withdrawal symptoms are miserable, but bearable. I have to say, I have been *much* sicker with the flu, than I ever was with opiate withdrawal. \n\nBut the difference lies in the possessiveness of lady H. When we are addicts, we are enslaved to the drug. It is our #1 top priority, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. (it was for me anyways)\n\nWhen we try to kick the habit, we become physically ill. (Albeit cruel & unusual punishment for taking a step in the right direction) Now the illness itself is uncomfortable at best, & miserable at worst. Yet, we still manage to function pretty well, all things considered. Therefor, it is not the physical symptoms that are incapacitating us.\n\nThe problem is, that lady H is a very possessive, & jealous lover. Even when we are broken up, she is out to make your life miserable. She still wants to be your #1 priority. \"till death do us part\" kind of shit. \n\nIf I had a cold, I would be able to distract/occupy myself enough to be indifferent to my cold. In full blown opiate withdrawal, I am lucky to get  an hour of sleep without her constantly on the front of my mind. She just won't GET OUT OF MY HEAD!\n\nThat all, is what I think makes opiate withdrawal unique.\n\nEDIT: I am 3 months clean now. 2 months was spent on replacement therapy.

I wanna beat his ass, I wanna make sure he's okay, I wanna be there for him while he has no one at this shelter 100's of miles from home.  I don't like these fucking real emotions I'm feeling but I know it's bound to happen again in the future. I guess this is a fact of the world we live in. Some of our friends go back to addiction.

I switched to kratom for about 2 months.( was previously on sub). Using about 30g of kratom a day to maintain so I had a bit of a heft habit. \n\nTook the subs for 7 days, still felt a bit strange during that time. Probably the kratom withdrawal under the subs.

My sleep has been decent fragmented but there.  This withdrawal was maybe 2/10th the strength of just going cold turkey.\n\nSo my advice is do not use sub long term unless your ready and willing to taper very slowly and truly have the self control to do so.

It's been 7 days since my last sub and I feel almost 100% PHYSICALLY normal.\n\nObviously the mental aspect will take time, but anyone who's interested or has questions feel free to shoot me a pm.

Still having restless legs, but my regular Dr says they're not related, which means that the only withdrawal symptom I had was insomnia, but I've been an insomniac my whole life (just not to that extent). I had a rough day today. My first holiday being 4k miles away from my family and also learning to deal with some major grief issues. No cravings other than the craving for pain relief. Just terrible anxiety. Went to the psychiatrist last week. He said something pretty dangerous to me. He said I never had a drug problem and was not an addict. I was very frank about my usage with him. He was supposed to do my med management for pain stuff (until I get into pain management).  totally forgot to even bring that up bc I was completely shocked and worried about his competency. He said I have severe PTSD.  Childhood trauma. Blah, blah. He prescribed he .5mg of resperidol at bedtime. I took it last night and it made me feel high as a kite. Don't think I'll be taking that ever again. I wanted to say ty for all of the private messages and support. I couldn't do it without u guys. I know I have a long way to go.
