  - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to the use of opiates is in the past tense, and the state label is 'withdrawal' or 'recovery'.
  - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

2. Label '0':
  - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
  - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
  - Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
