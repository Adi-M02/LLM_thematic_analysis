On the break I was busted and sent to detox there again for the fourth time. I felt hopeless, useless, and afraid.

Earlier that summer I was diagnosed as being bipolar and having borderline personality disorder. I felt even more afraid being told that I was being shipped off to the Hazelden in MN. I was pissed off at not only not being able to have my last 20 dollar fix but by my parent shipping me off to fucking MN where it’s cold as hell.

When I had got there I was still pissed and made a promise to myself that I’d only stay there for a week, I mean I had front row seats to a Green Day concert along with having one of my “ best friends” moving back to NM. I had missions to go and bust. After a week, I realized how truly sick I was and that I truly need to stay. I signed on for 6 weeks. I paid for it all myself out of pocket.

Before this all happened I had been a very successful escort and had more money than god. In that time I got healthier each day. I quit participating in every unhealthy behavior I had which included anorexia and body mutilation( there are some weird fucks who think that’s really sexy) when I returned home I made a 180.

My parents are proud of me with all the hard work I put in to stay clean, my boyfriend and I got back together when he had gotten back home from Kuwait( he’s a corpsman in the Navy) and my sister hates me significantly less. This man who’s my boyfriend talked with me every day despite the time difference between us and he even picked me up from the airport.

He’s one of the very few who stuck by me through thick and thin, and disputed how badly I’ve fucked him over knew I only acted as such when I was using.",False
