Fast forward 8 years, I have tried every drug you can possibly think of. Was able to avoid any physical addictions or health complications. Until I landed my first ""big boy job"" This was a job that paid very well but was extremely physically laborious. So I reached out to my old friend Mr opiate.

Oxycodone was his name, at first a welcome friend to my days of hardship. He made me warm and fuzzy, energetic, hopeful. And for a while it seemed like I had the world by the balls. Until one day slowly without realizing it, the tables had turned. My doses slowly escalated as did my need for oxycontin to be entertwined not only with my work but daily activities outside of work.

Two years went by and I was making close to 1500$ a week living at home with my parents, paying close to no bills.....with a bank account running on E. Oxycontin was no longer my friend, but my lifeblood. I needed it more than food in the morning. I can remember countless days choosing to obstain from eating in order to get another pill. If I did not dose every 5-6 hours the chills would set in, and I knew just how screwed I truley was.

This behavior went on for a while until I reached out and went to a Suboxone doctor.

I knew this was simply trading one addiction for another, and I'm not one to advocate using narcotics with potentially even worse withdrawal and addiction rate than the very pills I was so desperate to escape from. But, suboxone gave me my life back just almost to the point were I wanted it.

My bank account skyrocketed, I was much more level headed, I was able to maintain and grow a beautiful relationship with my partner. But in the back of my head I knew that eventually there would come a time I needed to get off the Suboxone as well.

Over a period of six months I went from 14mg-2mg. Until without my doctor's supervision or knowledge decided I had enough of the shackled and jumped off the subs at 2mg.",False
