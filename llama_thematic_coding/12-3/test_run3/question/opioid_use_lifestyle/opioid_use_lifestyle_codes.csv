2uuhv1,1,0,"So at this point in my life I'm pretty well-versed in opiate withdrawal... how does it compare to withdrawal from uppers? I used to be prescribed Vyvanse daily, but didn't like it too much and went through a period of being really angry and short-tempered for like four days when I stopped it (but I didn't really notice it, maybe because I only had 30mg pills). Is withdrawal from meth/coke similar to this ? How does it compare to dope withdrawal? Simply a point of curiosity.",
