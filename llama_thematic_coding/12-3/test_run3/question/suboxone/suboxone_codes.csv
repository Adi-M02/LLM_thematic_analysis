Trying to fix the door, looks like I'm trying to break into my own apt. Still had my jail wristband on and the cops drive by. Luckily they didn't stop, seriously hate police. Finally like 20 mins later I get in. Go up and found some trammys I forgot I had. Took 200mg and .2 clonidine and ate some food. I immediately puked then immediately shit my brains out. Afterwards I laid on the bathroom floor crying in the fetal position for like 5 mins. So I crawl back out to my living room and eat a whole 8mg strip of Sub. Sweet relief. Thank god.",True
