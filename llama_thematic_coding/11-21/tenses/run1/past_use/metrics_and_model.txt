Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Code '1': If the language which refers to the use of opioids is in the past tense, and the state label is 'withdrawal' or 'recovery', respond with '1'.

2. Code '0': If the above condition is not met, respond with '0'.

Important Notes:

- Definitions of Addiction States Labels:

  - Use: The state of use is characterized by opiate users who are in active use but may have contemplated or made plans for recovery but have not put them into action.

  - Withdrawal: The state of withdrawal is lengthy and often involves difficult withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal may be assisted through the use of medically prescribed opiates as a substitute, which can last up to 40 days after the start of treatment.

  - Recovery: The state of recovery succeeds a complete withdrawal state and begins when an opiate user's efforts to cease intake have lasted long enough for withdrawal symptoms to largely subside. In this state, recovering users are in stage of maintenance, attempting to remain vigilant of their sobriety throughout the rest of their life.

- Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- State label is an input provided (either 'use', 'withdrawal', or 'recovery').

Examples:

- Example 1:

  - Post Title: "I used opioids for years but now I'm clean"

  - Addiction State Language: "used opioids" (past tense)

  - State Label: 'recovery'

  - Classification: '1'

- Example 2:

  - Post Title: "Currently struggling with opioid addiction"

  - Addiction State Language: "struggling with opioid addiction" (present tense)

  - State Label: 'use'

  - Classification: '0'

- Example 3:

  - Post Title: "Will start rehab next week"

  - Addiction State Language: "Will start rehab" (future tense)

  - State Label: 'withdrawal'

  - Classification: '0'

- Example 4:

  - Post Title: "Overcame my addiction last year"

  - Addiction State Language: "Overcame my addiction" (past tense)

  - State Label: 'recovery'

  - Classification: '1'

- Example 5:

  - Post Title: "I am using again after relapse"

  - Addiction State Language: "am using again" (present tense)

  - State Label: 'use'
