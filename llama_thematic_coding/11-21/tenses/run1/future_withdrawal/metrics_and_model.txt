Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Code '1': If the language which refers to the withdrawl from opioids is in the future tense tense. i.e. planning to withdraw, respond with '1'.

2. Code '0': If the above condition is not met, respond with '0'.

Important Notes:

- Definitions of Addiction States Labels:

  - Use: The state of use is characterized by opiate users who are in active use but may have contemplated or made plans for recovery but have not put them into action.

  - Withdrawal: The state of withdrawal is lengthy and often involves difficult withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal may be assisted through the use of medically prescribed opiates as a substitute, which can last up to 40 days after the start of treatment.

  - Recovery: The state of recovery succeeds a complete withdrawal state and begins when an opiate user's efforts to cease intake have lasted long enough for withdrawal symptoms to largely subside. In this state, recovering users are in stage of maintenance, attempting to remain vigilant of their sobriety throughout the rest of their life.

- Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- State label is an input provided (either 'use', 'withdrawal', or 'recovery').

Examples:

- Example 1:

  - Post Title: "I will begin withdrawal tomorrow"

  - Addiction State Language: "will begin withdrawal" (future tense, referring to withdrawal)

  - Classification: '1'

- Example 2:

  - Post Title: "Starting detox next week"

  - Addiction State Language: "Starting detox next week" (future tense, referring to withdrawal)

  - Classification: '1'

- Example 3:

  - Post Title: "Currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms"

  - Addiction State Language: "experiencing withdrawal symptoms" (present tense, referring to withdrawal)

  - Classification: '0'

- Example 4:

  - Post Title: "Went through withdrawal last month"

  - Addiction State Language: "Went through withdrawal" (past tense, referring to withdrawal)

  - Classification: '0'

- Example 5:

  - Post Title: "Will I survive withdrawal?"

  - Addiction State Language: "Will I survive withdrawal?" (future tense, referring to withdrawal)
