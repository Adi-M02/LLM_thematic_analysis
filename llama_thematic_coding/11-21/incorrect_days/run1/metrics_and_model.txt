Instructions:

Classify the post by applying these rules in order of priority:

1. Rule 1: If the state label is 'use', respond with '0'. 
2. Rule 2: If the post includes a clear number of current days clean from opioids (e.g., "I have been clean from opioids for 30 days") without conflicting information about the use of opioids or other substances (excluding opioid recovery medications), respond with '0'.

3. Rule 3: If the post includes conflicting information about current substance use (e.g., the user mentions being clean from opioids but also describes ongoing use of opioids or other substances), respond with '1'.

4. Rule 4: If the post does not mention days clean from opioids, mentions multiple numbers of days clean without clarity, uses vague terms (e.g., "a few days", "some time"), or the number of days clean from opioids is unclear, respond with '1'.

Important Notes:

- Always apply the rules in order. Once a rule applies, stop and respond accordingly.

- Definition of Conflicting Information: Conflicting information occurs when a user states they are clean from opioids but also describes ongoing use of opioids or other substances (e.g., alcohol, stimulants). Mentions of using opioid recovery medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone should be ignored for the purposes of determining conflicting information.

- State Label Importance: The state label is critical for classification. If it is 'use', respond with '0' immediately.
