Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Code '1': If the language which refers to the recovery from opioids is in the past tense, and the state label is 'use' or 'withdrawal', respond with '1'.

2. Code '0': If the above condition is not met, respond with '0'.

Important Notes:

- Definitions of Addiction States Labels:

  - Use: The state of use is characterized by opiate users who are in active use but may have contemplated or made plans for recovery but have not put them into action.

  - Withdrawal: The state of withdrawal is lengthy and often involves difficult withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal may be assisted through the use of medically prescribed opiates as a substitute, which can last up to 40 days after the start of treatment.

  - Recovery: The state of recovery succeeds a complete withdrawal state and begins when an opiate user's efforts to cease intake have lasted long enough for withdrawal symptoms to largely subside. In this state, recovering users are in stage of maintenance, attempting to remain vigilant of their sobriety throughout the rest of their life.

- Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- State label is an input provided (either 'use', 'withdrawal', or 'recovery').

- Example 1:

  - Post Title: "I recovered from addiction last year"

- Example 4:
