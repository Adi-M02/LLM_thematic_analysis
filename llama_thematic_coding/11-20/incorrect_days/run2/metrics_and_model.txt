        "content": "You are a researcher in an academic research study focused on posts about opiate use on Reddit. Your task is to classify posts into two categories based on whether the number of days clean from opioids and other drugs is explicitly mentioned. Apply the following rules in order, starting with Rule 1. Respond with only '0' or '1'. Do not include reasoning, explanations, or additional text in your responses."

Instructions:

Classify the post by applying these rules in order of priority:

1. Rule 1: If the state label is 'use' and there is no conflicting information about opioid use or other non opioid recovery drugs, respond with '0'.

2. Rule 2: If the post includes a clear number of current days clean from opioids (e.g., 'I have been clean from opioids for 30 days') without conflicting information about other non opioid recovery drugs, respond with '0'.

3. Rule 3: If the post includes conflicting information about current substance use (e.g., the user mentions being clean from opioids but also describes ongoing use of opioids or other substances), respond with '1'.

4. Rule 4: If the post does not mention days clean from opioids, mentions multiple numbers of days clean, includes vague terms (e.g., 'a few days', 'some time'), uses metaphorical language, or the number of days clean from opioids is unclear, respond with '1'.

Important Notes:

- Always apply the rules in order. Once a rule applies, do not consider the subsequent rules.

- Definition of Conflicting Information: Conflicting information occurs when a user states they are clean from opioids but also describes ongoing use of opioids or other substances (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, stimulants). Mentions of using opiate recovery drugs such as kratom, suboxone, or methadone do not count as conflicting information about being clean from opioids. Ignore infomration on opiate recovery drugs in your classification.

- Use of Opiate Recovery Drugs: Mentions of using opiate recovery drugs such as kratom, suboxone, or methadone should be ignored for the purposes of determining conflicting information.

- Ignore mentions of future intentions or past periods of being clean unless they state the current number of days clean from opioids without conflicting information.
