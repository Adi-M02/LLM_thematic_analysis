Post: {post}
Title: {title}
State label: {state_label}

Follow these rules to classify the post:

1. If the state label is 'use', respond with '0'.

2. If the post includes a single, clear number of current days clean (e.g., 'I have been clean for 30 days'), respond with '0'.

3. If the post does not mention days clean, mentions multiple numbers of days clean, includes vague terms (e.g., 'a few days', 'some time'), or the number of days clean is unclear, respond with '1'.

Note: Ignore mentions of future intentions (e.g., 'I will be clean for 30 days') or past periods of being clean (e.g., 'I was clean for 30 days last year') unless they state the current number of days clean.

Respond with exactly one digit: '0' or '1'. Do not include any other text."""
