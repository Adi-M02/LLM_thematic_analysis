Instructions:

Classify the post by applying these rules in order of priority:

1. Rule 1: If the state label is 'use', respond with '0'. 
2. Rule 2: If the post includes a clear number of current days clean from opioids (e.g., "I have been clean from opioids for 30 days") without conflicting information about the use of opioids or other substances (excluding opioid recovery medications), respond with '0'.

3. Rule 3: If the post includes conflicting information about current substance use (e.g., the user mentions being clean from opioids but also describes ongoing use of opioids or other substances), respond with '1'.

4. Rule 4: If the post does not mention days clean from opioids, mentions multiple numbers of days clean without clarity, uses vague terms (e.g., "a few days", "some time"), or the number of days clean from opioids is unclear, respond with '1'.

Important Notes:

- Always apply the rules in order. Once a rule applies, stop and respond accordingly.

- Definition of Conflicting Information: Conflicting information occurs when a user states they are clean from opioids but also describes ongoing use of opioids or other substances (e.g., alcohol, stimulants). Mentions of using opioid recovery medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone should be ignored for the purposes of determining conflicting information.

- State Label Importance: The state label is critical for classification. If it is 'use', respond with '0' immediately.

Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post and post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1': Assign label '1' If the language which refers to the user's addiction state is not in the past or future tense or if there is language which refers to the user's addiction state in the present tense. Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

2. Label '0': Assign label '0' if any language referring to the user's addiction state is in the past or future tense. Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

Important Notes:

- Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
- Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

Definitions of Addiction States Labels:

    - Use: The state of use is characterized by opiate users who are in active use but may have contemplated or made plans for recovery but have not put them into action.

    - Withdrawal: The state of withdrawal is lengthy and often involves difficult withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal may be assisted through the use of medically prescribed opiates as a substitute, which can last up to 40 days after the start of treatment.

    - Recovery: The state of recovery succeeds a complete withdrawal state and begins when an opiate user's efforts to cease intake have lasted long enough for withdrawal symptoms to largely subside. In this state, recovering users are in the Transtheoretical Model stage of maintenance, attempting to remain vigilant of their sobriety throughout the rest of their life.

Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post and post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1': Assign label '1' if all language referring to the user's addiction state is in the present tense or has no tense. Provide the verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

2. Label '0': Assign label '0' if any language referring to the user's addiction state is in the past or future tense. Provide the verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

Important Notes:

- Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
- Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

Definitions of Addiction States Labels:

    - Use: The state of use is characterized by opiate users who are in active use but may have contemplated or made plans for recovery but have not put them into action.

    - Withdrawal: The state of withdrawal is lengthy and often involves difficult withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal may be assisted through the use of medically prescribed opiates as a substitute, which can last up to 40 days after the start of treatment.

    - Recovery: The state of recovery succeeds a complete withdrawal state and begins when an opiate user's efforts to cease intake have lasted long enough for withdrawal symptoms to largely subside. In this state, recovering users are in the Transtheoretical Model stage of maintenance, attempting to remain vigilant of their sobriety throughout the rest of their life.

Based on the following inputs:

**Post**: 
{post}
**Post Title**: 
{title}

Your Response:

Respond with a well-formatted JSON object with 'label': 0 or 1 and 'language': 'verbatim section of the text that supports the label'. Do not include any other text."""
