Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post and post title, and classify it according to the following rules:

  1. Label '1':
    - Assign label '1' if the language referring to the user's addiction state is in the present tense or has no tense.
    - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

  2. Label '0':
    - Assign label '0' if any language referring to the user's addiction state is in the past tense or future tense.
    - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
  - Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
  - Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- Definitions of Addiction States:
  - Use: The user is engaged in opiate use without consideration of quitting or expressing desire to stop using opiates to prepare to quit. 
  - Withdrawal: The user has ceased or lowered their opiate intake. Opiate withdrawal is accompanied by a combination of physical and emotional symptoms.
  - Recovery: The user has finished detoxing and is attempting to sustain abstinence from opiates long term.
