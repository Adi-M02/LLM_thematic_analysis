    Instructions:

    Consider the addiction state label and the addiction state language in the post and post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1':
  - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to recovery from opiates is in the past tense, and the state label is 'use' or 'withdrawal'.
  - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

2. Label '0':
  - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
  - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
  - Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
  - Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- Definitions of Addiction States:

  - Withdrawal: The user has ceased or lowered their opiate intake. Opiate withdrawal is accompanied by a combination of physical and emotional symptoms.
  - Recovery: The user has finished detoxing and is attempting to sustain abstinence from opiates long term.
