    Instructions:

    Analyze the addiction state language in the post and post title, and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1':
  - Assign label '1' if the user is engaged in irregular opiate use, which is periods of abstinence from opiates with the intention of returning to using opiates, or maintaining a reduced opiate intake without the intention to cease use, or withdrawing from opiates for the purpose of lowering their tolerance. 
  - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

2. Label '0':
  - Assign label '0' if the user is not engaged in irregular opiate use.
  - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
- Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.

- Definitions of Addiction States:
- Use: The user is engaged in opiate use without consideration of quitting or expressing desire to stop using opiates to prepare to quit. 
- Withdrawal: The user has ceased or lowered their opiate intake. Opiate withdrawal is accompanied by a combination of physical and emotional symptoms.
- Recovery: The user has finished detoxing and is attempting to sustain abstinence from opiates long term.
