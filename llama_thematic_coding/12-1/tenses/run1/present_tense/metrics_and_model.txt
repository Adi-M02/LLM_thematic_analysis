     - Assign label '1' if the language referring to the user's addiction state is in the present tense or has no tense.
     - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

  2. Label '0':
     - Assign label '0' if any language referring to the user's addiction state is in the past tense or future tense.
