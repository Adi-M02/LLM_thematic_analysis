Instructions:

Analyze the addiction state language in the post and post title, and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1':
   - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to withdrawal from opioids is in the future tense.
   - Provide a verbatim section of the text from the post title that supports the label.

2. Label '0':
   - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
   - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
  - Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
  - Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- Definitions of Addiction States:
