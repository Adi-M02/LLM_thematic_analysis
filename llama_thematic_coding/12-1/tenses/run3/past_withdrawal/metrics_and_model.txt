Instructions:

Consider the addiction state label and the addiction state language in the post and post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1':
   - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to the withdrawal from opioids is in the past tense, and the state label is 'use' or 'recovery'.
   - Provide a verbatim section of the text from the post title that supports the label.

2. Label '0':
   - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
   - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.
