Instructions:

Consider the addiction state label and the addiction state language in the post and post title and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1':
   - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to recovery from opioids is in the past tense, and the state label is 'use' or 'withdrawal'.
   - Provide a verbatim section of the text from the post title that supports the label.

2. Label '0':
   - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
   - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
  - Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
  - Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

- Definitions of Addiction States:
  - Use: The user is engaged in opiate use without consideration of quitting or expressing desire to stop using opiates to prepare to quit. 
  - Withdrawal: The user has ceased or lowered their opiate intake. Opiate withdrawal is accompanied by a combination of physical and emotional symptoms.
  - Recovery: The user has finished detoxing and is attempting to sustain abstinence from opiates long term.

  {{"label": 0 or 1, "language": "verbatim section of the text that supports the label"}}
