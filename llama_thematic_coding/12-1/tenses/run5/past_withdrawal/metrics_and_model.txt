  Instructions:

  Consider the addiction state label and the addiction state language in the post and post title and classify it according to the following rules:

  1. Label '1':
    - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to the withdrawal from opioids is in the past tense, and the state label is 'use' or 'recovery'.
    - Provide a verbatim section of the text that supports the label.

  2. Label '0':
    - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
    - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.

  - Important Notes:
    - Addiction state language refers to mentions of use, withdrawal, or recovery related to opiate addiction.
    - Tense refers to the grammatical tense (past, present, future) used when discussing the addiction state.

  - Definitions of Addiction States:
    - Use: The user is engaged in opiate use without consideration of quitting or expressing desire to stop using opiates to prepare to quit. 
    - Withdrawal: The user has ceased or lowered their opiate intake. Opiate withdrawal is accompanied by a combination of physical and emotional symptoms.
    - Recovery: The user has finished detoxing and is attempting to sustain abstinence from opiates long term.

  - Response Format:
    {{"label": 0 or 1, "language": "verbatim section of the text that supports the label"}}

  - Respond based on the following inputs:
    Post: {post}
    Post Title: {title}
