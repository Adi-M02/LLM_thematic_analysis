Analyze the addiction state language in the post and post title, and classify it according to the following rules:

1. Label '1':
   - Assign label '1' if all the language which refers to withdrawal from opioids is in the future tense.

2. Label '0':
   - Assign label '0' if the above condition is not met.
   - Respond 'None' in the section of your response that supports the label.

- Important Notes:
