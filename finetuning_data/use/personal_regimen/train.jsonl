If you haven't been told, you are loved! No matter if you're 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, or more; just stay sober for today. For anyone just starting off, I have had 23 relapses and I've never had this much clean time before. It's still a struggle at times, but when I look back its amazing how much not only my life, but myself has improved these last 6 weeks! Hang in there guys/gals, it really does get better!

Still having restless legs, but my regular Dr says they're not related, which means that the only withdrawal symptom I had was insomnia, but I've been an insomniac my whole life (just not to that extent). I had a rough day today. My first holiday being 4k miles away from my family and also learning to deal with some major grief issues. No cravings other than the craving for pain relief. Just terrible anxiety. Went to the psychiatrist last week. He said something pretty dangerous to me. He said I never had a drug problem and was not an addict. I was very frank about my usage with him. He was supposed to do my med management for pain stuff (until I get into pain management).  totally forgot to even bring that up bc I was completely shocked and worried about his competency. He said I have severe PTSD.  Childhood trauma. Blah, blah. He prescribed he .5mg of resperidol at bedtime. I took it last night and it made me feel high as a kite. Don't think I'll be taking that ever again. I wanted to say ty for all of the private messages and support. I couldn't do it without u guys. I know I have a long way to go.

{"text": "Proposed Sabrina's Law in NJ . So the other day I was listening to the radio in NJ. This woman came on who was spreading news about this proposed law she is lobbying with Legislators to pass. Its called Sabrina's Law (named after her daughter who OD'd & died on dope). The law would allow concerned family and friends of addicts to contact courts in order to get the addict committed to a rehab facility. So in other words, the court system can mandate people to rehabs regardless of whether or not you have committed a crime. All they need is a testimony from a family member or friend that confirms the person's addiction problem. Sabrina's mother said the thinking behind this law is that \"when people are using drugs they can't make good decisions, so lets enable families and courts to make the decision for them and get them the help they need sooner.\" \n\n\nIdk about you guys but I oppose this legislation. I support addicts getting help and going to treatment but you can't always force them to. Every addict has their own process and progression, they need to get to the point of desperation where they'll have a genuine desire for recovery. If you commit addicts to rehabs when they aren't ready that will only foster animosity between the addict and family. I thought this was an issue worth discussing. Also I don't support involving the government more and more in peoples recovery....we already have drug court isn't that enough?", "label": 0}

I was convinced I was now broken, flawed, less than whole because of the diagnosis.\n\nAnyway about 6-7 months after I finally got out of my house to get help from a psychiatrist.  After our meeting she was convinced the episode was due to the opiate cessation, perscribed me some wellbutrin, and I was great for about...6 years. \n\nLong story short, got dirty again, now clean, have had zero desire to sleep the couple nights, something that happens during a manic episode.

So I've been noticing a lot of posts lately where people in recovery are talking about how they still drink, or take benzos, or smoke weed\u2026 you get it. When I read stuff like that I feel myself getting angry for some reason. It's been bothering me that I get so angry, so I've been thinking a lot about why. \n\nAt first I was telling myself that I felt bad for those people.  That I was sad that they haven't found true recovery yet.  That being said,  I keep hearing my psychologist's voice in my head. \"If you find yourself getting angry/impatient/any negative emotion, it's probably one of your own character defects that's respinsible; not the other person\". So what is it that's making me feel the way I do when I read this stuff? \n\nHere's what Ive come up with: With only 60 days clean myself, I think I'm a little jealous that other opiate addicts are still using mind altering chemicals. In some weird way, I wish I could sill drink or smoke or take other pills, and those suppressed longings are turning into something different. \n\nThat being said, I have no intentions of doing so.  I've accepted that I'm not only an opiate addict, but I'm an ADDICT ADDICT. No mind altering chemicals for me. And I truly do hope that if you're an addict, that you find peace in your recovery, however you do it. Sorry if I've come off like a Dick in any of my comments in the past couple weeks.", "label": 0}

In the last year I have transformed my body through yoga and weight lifting.  I got a promotion at my job, resulting in a much higher salary.  I have also worked very hard in trying to repair the damage done to my psyche through years of abuse, drugs and otherwise.  As I sit here now, all I can think is why.\n\nWhy did I do any of this.  Why did I put all this work in.  Why try to get better when it is your brain that is broken.  I will always be a sad, shell of a human, doing anything and everything to make the people around me think otherwise.  \n\nAs open as I've tried to be about everything in my life, the thing I most want to talk about, is that which is verboten.  You simply cannot discuss addiction of any kind without being classified, pitied, or even worse, championed.  I get sick to my stomach when people congratulate me on being clean.  If they only knew the shit I did while using, there is no way I would be being celebrated.  \n\nSo I come here looking for support again, just as I did about a year ago today when I got clean.  Won't be responding til later on tonight, have to try and get some sleep.\n\nTo all you thinking of getting clean do it, you are loved, you are worth it.

This is just a backup plan incase I have a horrible time coming off of the suboxone. \n\nAlso I have been on Valium for 7 years and also a horrible drug to come off of since it's such long lasting like suboxone.

A slightly alien yet heavy rush, which at first seems to suggest I am in for a lengthy and perhaps dangerous nod, which then wears off quite quickly leaving a mediocre high for the remainder.\n\nFentanyl? Check. But here's the thing - the gear is very hard, takes a lot - I mean **a lot** of acid to break down and bubbles as a very thick, opaque mixture before settling into a combined sediment / translucent golden liquid. The more acid - the less sediment.\n\nWhat is going on with this kit? Has anyone seen anything similar and maybe know what's going on here?\n\nIt's the strongest stuff we've had in years but isn't strong in the way I remember the good stuff hitting.\n\nThanks r/opiates.

My family still see me as the piece of shit I use to be but I can honestly say that I have done a completely 180 and would not even dream of the things I may have done before. I know it is not their fault but I have been making great strides since those dark days. I seem to still be seen as  might be able to trust me, might not be able to. I mean they have trusted me a lot more since then, but, it doesn't come close to how my other sibling is treated. Have any of you been through this? How do you cope with the emotions of not being accepted as a normal human being even though you are doing all that you can do and genially care about others and show it day in and day out.", "label": 0}

Really hypothetical, just writing this for fun as a thought experiment, as I\u2019m curious if anyone has ever thought about this, and what you all think about this.\nSo as most of us know, withdrawal is very similar to the flu. I just had the thought that if someone who is on subs, methadone, or using, and has been wanting to jump off/get clean...\nIf you happen to be unlucky enough to have gotten the flu- would that not be a potentially perfect situation to just jump off? Since you are already experiencing all of the terrible physical symptoms whether you like it or not, I wonder if this situation would make it \u201ceasier\u201d both physically and mentally, since you know you are going to feel that way regardless of using or not.\nThis probably applies more to people on maintenance, as I would imagine if you get the flu while actively using, that\u2019s most likely just a reason to use more to make it \u2018better\u2019. \nAs I said, this just popped into my head and I thought it would be fun to see what others in this community think about it.

To this day I still have no idea what I said or did that caused her to call the cops. She went to the ER later that day because I was almost 51/50, I have a long history with mental illness and a year and a half ago I was diagnosed bipolar. She took my phone, cash, and told me that I was on my own and that our family did not want to do anything with me if I was still using. I had been alone, I ran away and went hitchhiking a few times and always came back. What she said really struck home and I knew that I had to do better. Since then I got my car back, some freedom, and I currently have a 4.0 in college.Because of my different illnesses I've decided that I want to help people and I'm going to school to be a psychologist. Recovery is possible. It's definitely not easy at all but I guarantee that the results are beautiful. Anyway thank you for letting me share my story reddit, I hope everyone has a beautiful day", "label": 0}

I went for the Narcan to get it ready. He saw me prepping it and literally ran away...but moments later he was completely unconscious and unresponsive on our bed, sweating profusely, skin turning from white to grey. I pulled down his jeans and stuck him in the thigh with the IM syringe. A few moments later he was in serious pain. He was still pale and sweating but now crying from the pain of precipitated w/d. I felt terrible for having to subject him to that kind of pain, but I was also furious because he insisted on doing the shot right before we were supposed to walk out the door to get to my morning Subutex dose and IOP group meeting. Ended up missing the meeting and getting a surprise UA when I finally did make it into the clinic. Sigh. Anyhow, just wanted to tell SOMEONE about the heart attack of the day.

Hi folks.\n\nI used to subscribe to /r/opiates but recently have been finding the content too provocative while trying to stop.\n\nQuick history : I've been messing around with heroin and bupe since about April - my most recent relapse. IV dope user for ~8 years. I became hooked mainly to the bupe this time, with occasional dope hits. It's been just over a week without bupe.\n\nTried to cold turkey but failed.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is how long after my last dose of bupe will it be before it is again effective for a rapid opiates detox?\n\nI've done it once before. I went from daily half teenth IV dope to nothing after a week of using gradually reduced doses of bupe. (eg Monday 8mg, Tuesday 6mg, Wednesday 6mg, Friday 4mg, Saturday 2mg, Sunday 1mg, Monday 1mg then off.)\n\nDoing this the only suffering I felt was some insomnia, but I hadn't taken buprenorphine for about 5 months.\n\n**TL:DR** Want to do a rapid bupe detox from dope, but only just stopped bupe habit a week ago. How long before the bupe is again effective in this capacity? I hope I was clear.\n\nThank you.", "label": 0}

It looks like a \"heroin rash\" from what Google images tells me but I haven't used in around 3 weeks and it only appeared around the time the h would have been leaving my system so I'm not sure if there's any correlation.

I know longer have health insurance so I can\u2019t go back to inpatient or outpatient rehab.                                                                                                  \n         On Monday I\u2019ll be 3 days into WD and will have to go back to work still dopesick and no money to get any good OTC\u2019s. I don\u2019t have a raging habit yet but definitely a habit, I do about 2-4 stamp bags a day (I snort). I can\u2019t quit my job because my sister got me the job and I don\u2019t want to make her look bad because it\u2019s not her problem. I\u2019m currently 12 hours clean and all I am really asking is that if there is anybody nice enough that would be willing to text with me while I go through withdrawal, especially during them hard days at work so I don\u2019t feel so alone. It would mean the world to me and would be only for a week till I can get to a meeting. Also, should I finally come clean to my uncle who is also an addict and is clean and let him know what\u2019s going on? My family has no clue what\u2019s going on and still thinks I\u2019m clean.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Crippling anxiety after 2 weeks . Tomorrow will be 2 weeks off benzos and hard opiates (trying to stabilize on Kratom). I technically started this journey weeks earlier than that but I would relapse whenever something came up. This time I avoided any phone calls that I knew would get to me, but my dad knows something is up and just pray he doesn't drive up (I live an hour away). I have dealing with this game for 2 months, I will not use for 3-4 days but would constantly relapse. I have avoided getting a new job until at least I stabilize on Kratom, I don't want to get more responsibilities before I take care of this one. I had no idea it would be so intense after 2 weeks. I only sleep hour stints, last week I was up for 4 days straight. Everything bothers me, my place is trashed from not doing crap for months, I worry that I won't get better and need to get a new job. My motor skills aren't working because of all the anxiety I add to a rough situation and the lack of sleep I get. Going outside feels so terrifying, esp when I am physically shaking and in constant cold sweats. This has to let up this week or I will break. I don't know how much my own obsessive fears are adding to my anxiety from detoxing off benzos and opiates.", "label": 0}
{"text": "I haven't withdrawaled in over a year! . Hello cool cats, it's been a while since ive posted, but some of you probably know me as the poppy tea guy (i get about 10 messages a day asking about the process of making the tea and places to order seeds from, but i don't mind! Ask away im happy to help!)\n\nAnyways i keep at least 40 pounds of poppyseeds for emergencies so i haven't gone through any withdrawals in a very long time (been abusing opiates for about 5 years now), i tend to drink about 2-3 pounds a day and i estimate I get about 80-150mg of morphine from that amount (I wash each batch of seeds 4 times to get every bitnof morphine i can) I always see people posting about withdrawals and i wonder why more of y'all dont keep seeds stocked just in case? They are cheap, legal, and its very easy to get morphine from them, doesn't even take 10 minutes.\n\nIm feeling really up and talkative today so i wanted to post something. If anyone has questions about poppy seed tea, the best methods to use, or websites where you can LEGALLY order it let me know. Just because we're addicts doesn't mean we need to go through withdrawals. I hope all of you have a happy, healthy, and safe day. Be careful out there. \n\n\n\nPeace  -FerretHydrocodone\n\n\nEdit: wow thanks for all the messages and replies everyone! This is the first time my inbox has actually \"blown up\". I'm just arriving at work so I'll have to reply to a few of you later on in the day, but I'll get to everyone :)", "label": 1}
{"text": "Day 10 check-in . Everything has been going well. I\u2019ve been waking up with a lot of anxiety which sucks but it does seem to fade once I start my day and get moving. My sleep has been getting better, got 6 hours the past 2 nights which is great but still feel tired and unmotivated throughout the day and the dreams I\u2019ve been getting have been super vivid and weird. I\u2019ve been working a lot lately and I hate my job so this coming Monday I\u2019m registering for school so I can go back in September. I\u2019m so excited to get started with school and do something I actually enjoy doing. So August 1st I\u2019ll be quitting my job and going back to school full time. If something does not make me happy I\u2019m changing it. Overall everything is good, not great, but good, I\u2019m getting there.", "label": 0}

{"text": "one year today . shot dope for the last time January 19th of last year if I am not mistaken. have not had a drink or a drug since.\n\nI spent six months in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous, repeatedly using because I was under the impression that I had the power to come back and to not use no matter what. Today my first step is that I always use, no matter what. By the grace of a power that is everything, I happened to meet a recovered heroin addict in NA who still tried to help me when everyone else failed. We went through the 12 steps in about four months, and ever since having had a spiritual awakening as the result of them, the obsession to get fucked up left and has not returned.\n\nI thought I was so hopeless that the last stop on the block couldn't get me better. I could not stay stopped from shooting heroin and ruining my life and the lives of those around me. The only thing I attribute my sobriety to is to constantly working the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, which allow me to be of service, and allow me to stay in the meetings of 12 step fellowships sober.\n\nIf you're new, and you're fucked. There's a way out. That was mine.\n\nAnd congratulations to everyone else celebrating.", "label": 0}
