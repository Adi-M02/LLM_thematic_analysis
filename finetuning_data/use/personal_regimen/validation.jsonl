However, I was nodding off in a weird ass position and the next morning i couldnt flex and could barely move my right hand. I also have this thing called \u201cwrist drop,\u201d which means i cannot extend my wrist because of the radial nerve palsy. The doc said itll take 4-6 weeks to heal and for me to regain mobility in that hand. Just wanted to let you guys know, as I did not think one night of sleeping weirdly would cause such a big problem with a long healing time. Im out of work as well since i cannot write at all because i cant grip anything. When nodding off, make sure you arent in a weird position!

I\u2019m having horrific anxiety and its really interfering with my quality of life. I was already hooked on benzos back in 2015 so that isnt an option for me. I\u2019m already on Zoloft (have been for many years), but seeing a psychiatrist tommorow to see about some options. I dont want to go on more meds if what im experiencing is temporary, but I feel like I\u2019m really suffering from panic and I dont know if its normal to be this anxious at 7 months sober. Anyone else experience anxiety even at 6+ months sober?", "label": 0}

So far I made it about two and a half days, last dose was Wednesday afternoon. I actually caved Friday morning and went to my guy and ended getting beat, the bags were 95% percent cut, I was just as sick after snorting it as I was before the fact. To be honest with you I was never so happy to get beat because now I no longer have a source since he was my only guy and I was a loner stoner so I don't know anyone else that uses. It was like God did this to me to tell me to fucking stop it lol, seriously. So I am basically going to go through it this time and need some support from you guys again to get through it. It's Saturday morning and I go back to work Monday and I doubt I'll be up for it but I have to go eithier way, it's going to be physically and emotionally challenging. The only good this is that I have a 4 day weekend coming up Friday-Monday. I really need your guys help to get through this work week sick and not able to sleep. Thanks guys. I'll also be posting once a day in this thread to get my thoughts out and my progress.", "label": 0}

What can I do to make it thru detox without killing myself (or really wanting to).\n**Edit: saw a psychiatrist today. He did not seem concerned about the benzos wd. Wouldn't give me anything to help. He also wouldn't put me on. Suboxone bc I have legit pain, and it cant be used for people who have pain management problems. He told me I should have never come here, but too late for that. He told me to call my insurance company bc they're responsible for my care. More time wasted. I am in the thick of wd. I can't do this**\n** EDIT 2 yay!! Day three without opiates or xanax!  I want to thank everyone who sent me a private message. Honestly, I couldn't do it without you guys. I have been to a couple of meeting. I am a little worried that the worst is yet to come.

So my main question is, does anyone have suggestions on dealing with the boredom, and other tips for getting and staying clean? I've gone through WDs before, but I always crack as soon as I have access to opiates again. I really want to STAY clean this time, and I'm hoping some of you guys will have advice on how to do so. I wasn't able to get any benzos, but I do have some old joints laying around that I forgot about until now. So my main question is, how do you guys deal with the psychological side of withdrawals?
