{"text": "Officially two years clean and started a support group . Hey everyone long time no post. As of October 12th I was officially two years sober and in that time my life has had its ups but mostly its downs. I waited to post this to make sure I go through the month. Even though it has been a tough couple years for me I've managed to stay strong and for the most part positive. One thing that has helped greatly is the alternative addiction and support group I started running. Unlike other support groups around my area I utilize tools of the botanical variety. I give out for free Kratom, Kava Kava, CBD and other such things to help my members stay clean or get clean. I have noticed a really good result because of these practices. Anyways I'd like to thank some of you guys in here for being awesome and talking to me when I'v been having a rough time and just keeping me on track. \n\nSo if anyone needs some advice or just simply to talk to whether it's about getting clean or just how your day's going send me a message. Everything we talk about is 100% confidential so you can feel safe. I know one huge key in recovery and hell just life overall is having someone to be able to vent to or just have a conversation with. So to make up for the less than desirable person I was when my using got bad I'd like to try and help out whoever I can. \n\nSo yea, if you want to just shoot me a PM and I'll be glad to talk to you.", "label": 0}

I feel like they didn't really detox me to well it was a 3 day stay of shoving subutex down my throat and putting me precipitated withdrawals lol, whatever I tried. But looking into other detoxs as I type, my problem is I've been prescribed benzos for 7 years and they are afraid to take me or they won't take me until I'm detoxed off of them but I'm sorry just one does not come off of benzos everyday for 7 years in 5 days while trying to detox off of heroin, it's a recipe for death, I'm weaning off of my benzos just fine which is Valium by the way down to 15 mg a day.

{"text": "Do you believe that a person can progress so far into addiction that they essentially are lost for good? Beyond recovering? . This question has been on my mind for some time now. I've been an IV heroin & coke aka speedball user for 4 years now and have relapsed over 5 times. Ive overdosed 1 time and also had cellulitis in my arm from dirty needles. Been arrested once before for drugs as well as been banned from retail stores for shoplifting. Stolen thousands of dollars from my family and former employers. Have almost 15 days clean now and I notice recovery has been getting harder and harder for me the more i relapse. \n\nAlso I know many other addicts some of whom have progressed very deep into addiction and every time those ones try to get clean it never lasts.  For example, my one friend has been shooting heroin & coke for over 7 years. He has been to 9 rehabs always relapsing within 3 months after his release. He has also been arrested 4 times, the most recent arrest was for robbing a convenience store with an illegal handgun. He was caught 2 weeks later and served around 1 year 8 months. I feel he has progressed to far for recovery to ever work.\n\nLets face it addiction changes you. It changes your personality, your chemical balances in your brain, your values, your norms.

I had a rough day today. My first holiday being 4k miles away from my family and also learning to deal with some major grief issues. No cravings other than the craving for pain relief. Just terrible anxiety. Went to the psychiatrist last week. He said something pretty dangerous to me. He said I never had a drug problem and was not an addict. I was very frank about my usage with him. He was supposed to do my med management for pain stuff (until I get into pain management).  totally forgot to even bring that up bc I was completely shocked and worried about his competency. He said I have severe PTSD.  Childhood trauma. Blah, blah. He prescribed he .5mg of resperidol at bedtime. I took it last night and it made me feel high as a kite.

But what kind of damage do you think I'm causing? How serious? Is my liver just being worn out quicker than an average persons? Any information or insight on this would be greatly appreciated!

He let me come stay with him while I detoxed. He was such a sweetie. He's had my back with some dealers. He's honestly been THE ONLY person in my life who's been support of me. But.... things are changing between us a little bit. He's still my best friend, but there's been a shift. He's going to court on Tuesday. I'm so, so scared he'll get convicted and I'll lose him.

{"text": "What makes opiate withdrawal unique . I think that for most, the physical withdrawal symptoms are miserable, but bearable. I have to say, I have been *much* sicker with the flu, than I ever was with opiate withdrawal. \n\nBut the difference lies in the possessiveness of lady H. When we are addicts, we are enslaved to the drug. It is our #1 top priority, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. (it was for me anyways)\n\nWhen we try to kick the habit, we become physically ill. (Albeit cruel & unusual punishment for taking a step in the right direction) Now the illness itself is uncomfortable at best, & miserable at worst. Yet, we still manage to function pretty well, all things considered. Therefor, it is not the physical symptoms that are incapacitating us.\n\nThe problem is, that lady H is a very possessive, & jealous lover. Even when we are broken up, she is out to make your life miserable. She still wants to be your #1 priority. \"till death do us part\" kind of shit. \n\nIf I had a cold, I would be able to distract/occupy myself enough to be indifferent to my cold. In full blown opiate withdrawal, I am lucky to get  an hour of sleep without her constantly on the front of my mind. She just won't GET OUT OF MY HEAD!\n\nThat all, is what I think makes opiate withdrawal unique.\n\nEDIT: I am 3 months clean now. 2 months was spent on replacement therapy. I was an addict for 3 years. If given the chance, I would probably do it all over again. No regrets, just lessons learned.", "label": 0}

When I read stuff like that I feel myself getting angry for some reason. It's been bothering me that I get so angry, so I've been thinking a lot about why. \n\nAt first I was telling myself that I felt bad for those people.  That I was sad that they haven't found true recovery yet.  That being said,  I keep hearing my psychologist's voice in my head. \"If you find yourself getting angry/impatient/any negative emotion, it's probably one of your own character defects that's respinsible; not the other person\". So what is it that's making me feel the way I do when I read this stuff? \n\nHere's what Ive come up with: With only 60 days clean myself, I think I'm a little jealous that other opiate addicts are still using mind altering chemicals. In some weird way, I wish I could sill drink or smoke or take other pills, and those suppressed longings are turning into something different. \n\nThat being said, I have no intentions of doing so.  I've accepted that I'm not only an opiate addict, but I'm an ADDICT ADDICT. No mind altering chemicals for me.

I was so happy with all the positive feedback I got, the support meant everything to me then and still does now. \nI wound up doing 21 days in inpatient then getting kicked out for fucking a stripper while inside lol but that's a long story (coed treatment is big down here). Since then I've decided to stay in Florida. now I'm living about a five minute walk from the beach and from my new place of work. I can honestly say I've never been so happy in my entire life. Everything is falling into place. I have a sponsor and attend meetings regularly as well as attend IOP three nights/ week. I'm working thru the steps right now and trying to better my connection with my higher power. \nJust wanted to let anyone that is struggling right now that it does get better as long as you keep doing the next right thing. Living on an altruistic plane is among one my biggest goals right now. Trust me, if I can do this...anyone can.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Four Months Clean Today . Hey reddit, I have four months clean today. These four months have been the hardest I've ever worked in my entire life. I've never had this amount of clean time ever. The longest I used to have was 39 days and the entire time I was white knuckling and just trying to get some cash together to go out and do what I did best. What made me want to change for the better was being in the ER after almost over dosing on heroin and acting very belligerent towards my mom. To this day I still have no idea what I said or did that caused her to call the cops. She went to the ER later that day because I was almost 51/50, I have a long history with mental illness and a year and a half ago I was diagnosed bipolar. She took my phone, cash, and told me that I was on my own and that our family did not want to do anything with me if I was still using. I had been alone, I ran away and went hitchhiking a few times and always came back. What she said really struck home and I knew that I had to do better. Since then I got my car back, some freedom, and I currently have a 4.0 in college.Because of my different illnesses I've decided that I want to help people and I'm going to school to be a psychologist. Recovery is possible. It's definitely not easy at all but I guarantee that the results are beautiful. Anyway thank you for letting me share my story reddit, I hope everyone has a beautiful day", "label": 0}

I'm at at 24mg dose of Lope, I started out Tuesday night at 36 mg.  I plan to reduce 4 mg each dose til day 5 where I half it til I'm at zero going in to the weekend, just in case I get any delayed withdrawal symptoms.\n\nJust making this post to see if anyone relates.

I had all the motivation in the world to be clean and I worked really, really hard to get there.\n\n But lately.. things have been weird. I haven't really had too many strong cravings or whatever. But I just don't feel the motivation to keep working at being clean. Like.. I want to go to parties. I want to hang out with my friends. I want to DO something. I feel like all I do is just sit around now because I lost all my friendships. I'm so fucking bored. I just kind of feel like, fuck it. Why not just go back to how it was? I don't know what to do.

{"text": "Proposed Sabrina's Law in NJ . So the other day I was listening to the radio in NJ. This woman came on who was spreading news about this proposed law she is lobbying with Legislators to pass. Its called Sabrina's Law (named after her daughter who OD'd & died on dope). The law would allow concerned family and friends of addicts to contact courts in order to get the addict committed to a rehab facility. So in other words, the court system can mandate people to rehabs regardless of whether or not you have committed a crime. All they need is a testimony from a family member or friend that confirms the person's addiction problem. Sabrina's mother said the thinking behind this law is that \"when people are using drugs they can't make good decisions, so lets enable families and courts to make the decision for them and get them the help they need sooner.\" \n\n\nIdk about you guys but I oppose this legislation. I support addicts getting help and going to treatment but you can't always force them to. Every addict has their own process and progression, they need to get to the point of desperation where they'll have a genuine desire for recovery. If you commit addicts to rehabs when they aren't ready that will only foster animosity between the addict and family. I thought this was an issue worth discussing.

If I didn't know it was 100% true I wouldn't even consider it to be a possibility. We've talked about it, he says it was extremely spiritual and constantly read the story of David and Goliath from the bible and David's words, \"This is the lord's battle\" said that was all he needed. I say he was completely delirious.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?", "label": 0}
{"text": "What does Spirituality mean to you? . I'm not gonna tell my whole story again, but basically, the spirituality aspect of NA kept me away for the longest time. I don't consider myself religious so I thought the fellowship wasn't for me. After a bad relapse, I found myself hopeless and ended up at the tables as a last resort. I didn't know what else to do. 100+ days later and I've been to at least one meeting pretty much every day. I'm pretty confident I'd be using if it wasn't for NA. \n\nMany people are scared away from 12 step groups because they are spiritual programs. But the mistake I was making was assuming that spirituality = religion. Because of my feelings on religion, it's taken me a while to figure out what spirituality means to me. Here's what I've come up with: it's about having a set of values/principles, and living by them. Something I never came close to doing when I was sticking needles in my arm. \n\nHow about y'all?

He saw me prepping it and literally ran away...but moments later he was completely unconscious and unresponsive on our bed, sweating profusely, skin turning from white to grey. I pulled down his jeans and stuck him in the thigh with the IM syringe. A few moments later he was in serious pain. He was still pale and sweating but now crying from the pain of precipitated w/d. I felt terrible for having to subject him to that kind of pain, but I was also furious because he insisted on doing the shot right before we were supposed to walk out the door to get to my morning Subutex dose and IOP group meeting. Ended up missing the meeting and getting a surprise UA when I finally did make it into the clinic. Sigh. Anyhow, just wanted to tell SOMEONE about the heart attack of the day. If you have access to Narcan, jump on that shit. It saved the life of someone I love dearly today. I would not want to be stuck in a similar situation without it. Going to start carrying it on me everywhere I go again. \n\nMuch love to yous guys, be well & happy scheming!", "label": 0}

{"text": "Additction is a Rollercoaster . After relapsing, I realized I am unprepared to get clean. The panic attacks, the roller-coaster of emotions, the stress, anxiety, no sleep, that itch to use, headaches, inability to concentrate. I want to go to a NA meeting but its snowing like a blizzard and I shoudlnt drive, luckily I havent used since yesterday, took some Vikes, about 20mg of them, it fended off the H w/d but now after they wore off the depression really hits hard, so 24 hours, I took 2mg of Sub, the relief is much needed but the anxiety and stress won't let up! Trying to do a Finals project for school is becoming impossible since I cannot concentrate. At this point I don't even thing using would help. Getting clean is deemed to be harder than I ever would have imagined! After talking to a  friend who got clean (30 Days) he suggests that I use or just take Subs until Finals week is over then go to inpatient or outpatient, but in the meantime, I should not put myself thru the misery of going cold turkey and have my grades suffer because of it.

I still haven't had the withdrawals I was expecting, no shitting water, no puking, no seizures (from benzo wd), no sweats. The wrestless legs still won't quit. My dr asked me how my detox was, and I explained, she said a lot of high volume user who have legitimate pain don't wd the way others do. Hopefully this gives someone hope.

My family still see me as the piece of shit I use to be but I can honestly say that I have done a completely 180 and would not even dream of the things I may have done before. I know it is not their fault but I have been making great strides since those dark days. I seem to still be seen as  might be able to trust me, might not be able to. I mean they have trusted me a lot more since then, but, it doesn't come close to how my other sibling is treated. Have any of you been through this?
