{"post_title": "Officially two years clean and started a support group .", "post_content": "Hey everyone long time no post. As of October 12th I was officially two years sober and in that time my life has had its ups but mostly its downs. I waited to post this to make sure I go through the month. Even though it has been a tough couple years for me I've managed to stay strong and for the most part positive. One thing that has helped greatly is the alternative addiction and support group I started running. Unlike other support groups around my area I utilize tools of the botanical variety. I give out for free Kratom, Kava Kava, CBD and other such things to help my members stay clean or get clean. I have noticed a really good result because of these practices. Anyways I'd like to thank some of you guys in here for being awesome and talking to me when I'v been having a rough time and just keeping me on track. \n\nSo if anyone needs some advice or just simply to talk to whether it's about getting clean or just how your day's going send me a message. Everything we talk about is 100% confidential so you can feel safe. I know one huge key in recovery and hell just life overall is having someone to be able to vent to or just have a conversation with. So to make up for the less than desirable person I was when my using got bad I'd like to try and help out whoever I can. \n\nSo yea, if you want to just shoot me a PM and I'll be glad to talk to you.", "label": 0}

But looking into other detoxs as I type, my problem is I've been prescribed benzos for 7 years and they are afraid to take me or they won't take me until I'm detoxed off of them but I'm sorry just one does not come off of benzos everyday for 7 years in 5 days while trying to detox off of heroin, it's a recipe for death, I'm weaning off of my benzos just fine which is Valium by the way down to 15 mg a day.

Stolen thousands of dollars from my family and former employers. Have almost 15 days clean now and I notice recovery has been getting harder and harder for me the more i relapse. \n\nAlso I know many other addicts some of whom have progressed very deep into addiction and every time those ones try to get clean it never lasts.  For example, my one friend has been shooting heroin & coke for over 7 years. He has been to 9 rehabs always relapsing within 3 months after his release. He has also been arrested 4 times, the most recent arrest was for robbing a convenience store with an illegal handgun. He was caught 2 weeks later and served around 1 year 8 months. I feel he has progressed to far for recovery to ever work.\n\nLets face it addiction changes you. It changes your personality, your chemical balances in your brain, your values, your norms.

I mean like once a month or two. \n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that really does want to stay clean, but a stronger side that\u2019s telling me I can manage using again. I keep telling myself it was never that bad, and I didn\u2019t use long enough, or my bottom wasn\u2019t low enough. But I don\u2019t have to experience that suffering if I choose not to. My life is pretty fucking good, and if the only thing I\u2019m worrying about now is losing sleep due to a small child then I\u2019ll take it. \n\nIdk. I guess all I\u2019m saying is that sobriety is possible. So if you\u2019re getting sober, don\u2019t give up. Just wanted to put it out there!\ud83d\ude0a", "label": 0}

I used Lope to taper, took 8mg this morning 830am, then 4mg before work at 5pm.  I didn't really want to take this dose but I was really afraid of getting serious gastro distress in the middle of work.\n\nBack home now, physical symptoms seem...pretty non existent?  I'm assume this is the Lope.  I'm just dealing with real bad depression right now, like can't stop crying/worthless/shit for brains/waste/burden/ etc.\n\nBefore my opiate issues I took Wellbutrin for depression which really helps, my plan is once I'm through day 5 or so to see a psychologist and get back on some mood medication.  I didn't do this before quitting because I knew if I got prescribed Subs, I'd be setting myself up for another battle.\n\nJust posting this seems to help, almost like a journal which others can respond and input on.\n\nI'm planning on possibly taking 2mg of Lope tonight to help me sleep, but I'm not sure, I might just drop off from 4mg because the bowel stuff scares me.\n\nI asked in my original post but does anyone think I'm gonna be in for a rough time tomorrow with no further Lope?  Last opiate use was 1.5 lbs PST Tuesday 5pm est, after an accidental taper with some less than proper seeds.", "label": 0}

I have to say, I have been *much* sicker with the flu, than I ever was with opiate withdrawal. \n\nBut the difference lies in the possessiveness of lady H. When we are addicts, we are enslaved to the drug. It is our #1 top priority, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. (it was for me anyways)\n\nWhen we try to kick the habit, we become physically ill. (Albeit cruel & unusual punishment for taking a step in the right direction) Now the illness itself is uncomfortable at best, & miserable at worst. Yet, we still manage to function pretty well, all things considered. Therefor, it is not the physical symptoms that are incapacitating us.\n\nThe problem is, that lady H is a very possessive, & jealous lover. Even when we are broken up, she is out to make your life miserable. She still wants to be your #1 priority. \"till death do us part\" kind of shit. \n\nIf I had a cold, I would be able to distract/occupy myself enough to be indifferent to my cold. In full blown opiate withdrawal, I am lucky to get  an hour of sleep without her constantly on the front of my mind. She just won't GET OUT OF MY HEAD!\n\nThat all, is what I think makes opiate withdrawal unique.\n\nEDIT: I am 3 months clean now. 2 months was spent on replacement therapy.

They are 7 day patches that come in increments of 5ug/hr, 10ug/hr, 20ug/hr (possibly more but not looking.)\n\nWeirdest part is, not only that I've never heard of OR seen them, But that the doc is going to prescribe bupe to a first time pain patient.  She'll be getting the 5ug ones and after research the whole thing only has about 5mg of bupe total to deliver over 7 days.   \n\nNow I think these would be great taper devices as the dose is so low.  But has anyone had any experience with these?  Doc says it will be the same as taking 3-4 10mg vikes everyday but without the Tylenol risk.  My opinion is going to be to tell her to say they work, but make her feel kind of weird after day 4-5.  Then maybe get something better.  Thoughts please.", "label": 0}

{"post_title": "Four Months Clean Today .", "post_content": "Hey reddit, I have four months clean today. These four months have been the hardest I've ever worked in my entire life. I've never had this amount of clean time ever. The longest I used to have was 39 days and the entire time I was white knuckling and just trying to get some cash together to go out and do what I did best. What made me want to change for the better was being in the ER after almost over dosing on heroin and acting very belligerent towards my mom. To this day I still have no idea what I said or did that caused her to call the cops. She went to the ER later that day because I was almost 51/50, I have a long history with mental illness and a year and a half ago I was diagnosed bipolar. She took my phone, cash, and told me that I was on my own and that our family did not want to do anything with me if I was still using. I had been alone, I ran away and went hitchhiking a few times and always came back. What she said really struck home and I knew that I had to do better. Since then I got my car back, some freedom, and I currently have a 4.0 in college.Because of my different illnesses I've decided that I want to help people and I'm going to school to be a psychologist. Recovery is possible. It's definitely not easy at all but I guarantee that the results are beautiful.

The law would allow concerned family and friends of addicts to contact courts in order to get the addict committed to a rehab facility. So in other words, the court system can mandate people to rehabs regardless of whether or not you have committed a crime. All they need is a testimony from a family member or friend that confirms the person's addiction problem. Sabrina's mother said the thinking behind this law is that \"when people are using drugs they can't make good decisions, so lets enable families and courts to make the decision for them and get them the help they need sooner.\" \n\n\nIdk about you guys but I oppose this legislation. I support addicts getting help and going to treatment but you can't always force them to. Every addict has their own process and progression, they need to get to the point of desperation where they'll have a genuine desire for recovery. If you commit addicts to rehabs when they aren't ready that will only foster animosity between the addict and family. I thought this was an issue worth discussing.

So i share how i feel and sure i may share that i am depressed and suicidal but like i said its how i feel i cant control how i feel so it is wat it is. Do i feel like a waste of space sure i do but at least im telling others about it. Sometimes i dont feel like i am 'inportant' enough to be herd. When i feel like im getting ignored well that hurts.

He saw me prepping it and literally ran away...but moments later he was completely unconscious and unresponsive on our bed, sweating profusely, skin turning from white to grey. I pulled down his jeans and stuck him in the thigh with the IM syringe. A few moments later he was in serious pain. He was still pale and sweating but now crying from the pain of precipitated w/d. I felt terrible for having to subject him to that kind of pain, but I was also furious because he insisted on doing the shot right before we were supposed to walk out the door to get to my morning Subutex dose and IOP group meeting. Ended up missing the meeting and getting a surprise UA when I finally did make it into the clinic. Sigh. Anyhow, just wanted to tell SOMEONE about the heart attack of the day.

Like my father always said; \"We're all doing the best we can in the reality we're living in.\"\n\nBe safe my friends, and if anyone ever wants to talk about ANYTHING, I am always down for a chat. \n\nSorry if I stepped on any toes, I might just be emotional and I don't mean to piss on anyones parade, and if I did feel free to let me know.\n\nAnyways, be easy friends and happy nods.", "label": 0}
