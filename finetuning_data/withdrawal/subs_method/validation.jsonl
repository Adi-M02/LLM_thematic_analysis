I switched to kratom for about 2 months.( was previously on sub). Using about 30g of kratom a day to maintain so I had a bit of a heft habit. \n\nTook the subs for 7 days, still felt a bit strange during that time. Probably the kratom withdrawal under the subs. I am now 7 days clean from the subs. I can honestly say compared to cold turkey this was a BREEZE. I have been able to eat at least a bit every single day. My sleep has been decent fragmented but there.  This withdrawal was maybe 2/10th the strength of just going cold turkey.\n\nSo my advice is do not use sub long term unless your ready and willing to taper very slowly and truly have the self control to do so.

I mean at this point I've used everyday for a week and now get withdrawals again. I have zero money, no car, and locked myself in a hotel room for a week. I isolated myself on purpose and all I have to cope with this is clonidine. My last time I used was yesterday morning. So, today is Saturday around noon I'm at the 24+ mark and the withdrawals are getting pretty bad. I puked alot this morning. The depression is seriously driving me crazy. I don't know what to do. All I can think about is shooting dope but since I have no way to cop, no money, no car its not happening. I feel so sick. I wish I had some suboxone or something to get me thru this. I know loperdimide is the way to go. But I have no money to buy it. I don't want to say it but I may shoplift some today, which is terrible but I'm at the end of my wits and I have no idea what to do. Please help!

I was previously an active user for 8 years with 6 months clean once or twice until this last 90 day slip. So now I'm miserable, out of options, and have to kick.

This is my second attempt at getting clean since relapsing (actually had a post on her about it but unfortunately failed but I'll keep on getting back up). So far I made it about two and a half days, last dose was Wednesday afternoon. I actually caved Friday morning and went to my guy and ended getting beat, the bags were 95% percent cut, I was just as sick after snorting it as I was before the fact. To be honest with you I was never so happy to get beat because now I no longer have a source since he was my only guy and I was a loner stoner so I don't know anyone else that uses. It was like God did this to me to tell me to fucking stop it lol, seriously. So I am basically going to go through it this time and need some support from you guys again to get through it. It's Saturday morning and I go back to work Monday and I doubt I'll be up for it but I have to go eithier way, it's going to be physically and emotionally challenging. The only good this is that I have a 4 day weekend coming up Friday-Monday. I really need your guys help to get through this work week sick and not able to sleep. Thanks guys.

I have been doing hot baths/shower, serious stretching before bed, trying not to eat anything as sometimes caffeine and sugar can make it worse.  Benadryl makes it much worse for me, don't have access to Benzos, and melatonin has also made it worse for me in the past.\n\nThanks all keep on keeping on!\n\nPS: Got in the car last night, turned on the radio and heard \"I wish I knew you when I was young, could have got sooo high\"  I thought it was rather apropos  for my current situation\n\nStay strong everyone!", "label": 0}
