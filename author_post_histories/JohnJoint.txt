They are very almost identical to the swirling circle things I did see on shrooms. The shape has a pattern in it too, like some type of alien glyph.
Just wondering if anyone else gets this (I know they do), I also smoke weed regularly and I find that also amplifies it a bit. 
Had an edible once that I got very anxious on (im quite prone to it with weed), it was a strong edible for the amount I usually smoke, and got them same shroomey patterns but very pronounced and it was like I was tripping on a visual aspect but just felt stoned and anxious, not like I was tripping (I also had loud music playing in my head during that edible - I make music myself and when im high it just comes into my head but on this it was in full throttle, not even good music).

I went out an meditated in nature then went home, my father asking what I had taken quite jokingly (my pupils are usually pinpoint). Anyway, I went to the bathroom immediately, bright lighting, and saw my enlarged eyes in the mirror. Thinking then wtf am I gonna do, they shrunk in size.
Now today I experimented with another substance called gabapentin. Smoked a lot of weed too and chilling with the fam. Went to the bathroom and my pupils were big and I was thinking they surely noticed that haha. They didn't, I went to bed, and I look at myself on the phone camera and they're small again.
Does anyone get this? Maybe its a coincidence or watever but it seems like my want and need to hide them eyes makes my pupils shrink. Idk if they'd shrink on a high dose of a psych, but its strange to me nonetheless.

I could write a trip report on gabapentin, to me it it is quite unique. Has the GABAergic feeling with also a dissociative effect which I'd think would increase with dosage., PERMALINK: /r/Psychonaut/comments/d0oahb/pupils_shrinking_themselves_to_hide_drug_use/

Still the negativity and stigma surrounding it is always a factor that could bite me in the ass one day. Not to mention how I have to break the law to get substances (not that it deters me, it's just hard to get tabs here).
I have tried with shrooms this year but due to lack of funds struggled to get a dehydrator so I don't many many. Season coming to an end now and I'm struggling with myself a bit at the moment. If I was able to trip more often, or at least not months apart with pot luck I get to trip at someone's house (been probably a year now).
It's just quite sad knowing something that I could really benefit from, there's no help for me. All of these different herbs, kava, kratom, and psyches that I could microdose (I really liked MDing, feel id really benefit from the energy it provides me especially struggling with digestive issues that leaves me fatigued), just imagine if everyone shared them and we had easier access.
I know some will say not to rely on drugs to better yourself, but for me, in my situation, I could really benefit from them for keeping me focused during college (I am always high, if not, my mind wanders) and not have to just smoke weed. When I have tripped, its helped, but I have never been able to properly experience those states in much depth to really get it to stick with me.

SUBREDDIT: shrooms, TIME: 2019-11-24 08:10:23, TITLE: Weird experience with low dose liberty caps (10 libs in a tea), POST BODY: So I had eaten 15 libs before in bed and had a similar experience, but this time it was a bit more intense because of the weed. Anyway so I ground up 10 last night and made a tea. I drank it and the remaining ground material at the bottom of the cup. I think I might have not steeped it for long enough or I should have done it twice. 

Anyway, it hits me way later, like an hour maybe with a subtle feeling leading up. I feel like I'm on a microdose (I MDd acid for a while) and I smoke a small bowl. I feel the familiar weed+md feeling. In bed, I listen to YouTube, until I soon feel too uncomfortable (coming up) and turn it off. I'm laying in the dark and bizzare thoughts start coming to me much like the time before. Thoughts were pretty racey but very little anxiety, knew I was fine just curious as to what thoughts I would get.
I start to have strange thought patterns and begin to have more vivid thoughts (not really solid visions, but more like more pronounced daydreams and just weirder stuff). 
I had visions of my family members and friends, accompanied by them talking usaully. Kept getting this weird vision of a guy with large pupils and thinking about how weird shrooms feel and how someone unprepared or easily spooked could go crazy during it (despite how the low the dose was).
I often get music playing in my head when I smoke anyway and I'm a musician so I often think of songs in my head. Very strange music starts coming to me, sometimes a single sound in one ear. Weird sudden noises are present too, like avant-garde music (The Residents - Mush room comes to mind). Some alien sounding stuff as well now and again.
This weird melody of a piano in my right ear and and another instrument playing together in my left. I feel almost entranced, but not totally. Very immersed and wish I had tried meditating during this. I did experience a pretty uncomfortable body load and couldn't keep my legs still, my dog didn't help taking up the space of my legs a bit too. I had my eyes closed for a while and didnt feel like keeping them open, and I'd get a subtle grid-like patterns and horizontal lines with some warping. Green comes to mind when I think of this, I think it's my shroom colour as I've had it before. I open my eyes and say "holy shit" or something like that, because I'm getting this weird hex-like pattern overlayed around my vision (on the outskirts of my vision).
I soon close them because I just couldn't keep them open. It was late and I was probably very tired.
The strangest part now. I need to use the toilet and want to move anyway because of my leg discomfort. I turn on the lamp and head to the toilet and its seeks the trip just totally vanished. Body load, thoughts and even the feeling was mostly gone. Went back to bed and slept with no strangeness from there on.
I think doing it in the dark in bed at night was a big factor (and the bowl) and if I was say, doing stuff in the day, I probably would have felt more normal. It wasn't hypnagogia although it does have some similarities. Very interesting nonetheless, PERMALINK: /r/shrooms/comments/e0yy6n/weird_experience_with_low_dose_liberty_caps_10/

Now I know you'll suggest to quit the weed and I agree but even so I feel like it's an addiction to pleasure as a whole. Anything that offers me momentary joy and sensory pleasure I am always seeking, and every day seems like a wait till the night where I can have my final high and drift off with something on YouTube.
Now I have a tab of acid thats been sitting in my drawer for a while that I havent been able to trip with but am considering MDing it instead. I want to know the most I can before going into it to maximise the benefits, as my last microdosing regime I feel was going well but I ran out of my supply sooner than I had expected (like a week earlier, month long microdose). Even if it lasted the whole month, I feel I didn't utilise it properly and the benefits did not last. I also feel 1 month wasn't long enough for me to integrate everything and to really solidify what I learn.

SUBREDDIT: psychonaut, TIME: 2020-02-08 02:20:55, TITLE: Inner visions with codeine and valerian root, POST BODY: I am at a hospital for the week. Last night I had some codeine, I believe 60mg for back pain. I took about 1300mg of valerian root for sleep. I had a nice vape session outside and went to bed. While laying there I began to feel very very relaxed after some time just laying back with my eyes closed. I started having strange but quite pleasurable sensations through my body, my legs mainly. Sort of like a mild pulsing/tingling. After a while I started getting these weird inner visions of the things that are around me like the bed and the table, seeing them with my eyes closed with different textures and things on them, such as a plate with food remnants on it (the plate was clean irl) and other stuff that I can't really remember very well but there were just the things around me with different stuff on them. It was all very vivid and entertaining.

I felt my very thin blanket above me and began to feel it differently, like it was thick foam. I also had this really bizzare thing happen now and again that happened my first night too, with codeine alone. I would sort of be projecting myself in another part of the room, knowing that I'm in bed but it was quite convincing. I felt like I was walking in the room. Nurses were back and fourth and hearing them triggered these sensations too, such as me walking from the bathroom and... A nurse slightly pushing me forward? Very odd indeed. The other night as well I would feel like I was floating accross the floor. This was all very amusing and felt like I was in a meditative state. Opening my eyes eliminated any of these effects. The cool thing was I would immediately get sucked back into it just by closing them. It's almost like hypnagogia, but much more awake/conscious. I'm wondering if anyone has had these sort of experiences. I'm sure I've had them before without any substances, but have also had vivid hypnagogic dreams with very low dose shrooms before. I love these types of experiences because of how subtle yet unique they are, and on such low doses.

So, I've seen varying water ratios online from 4ml per pill and using the least amount possible to using half a cup. Which is best for ensuring that all of the codeine is indeed in the final solution? Would too little water for a dose of say 150mg not be able to contain the whole dose? 
I have 24x 7mg pills. This dose is above 100mg (168mg) so would that mean I need more than 100ml?
Also how much is lost in this process. I've read 20% but to be honest I tried to figure it out (I know, its simple maths...) and had different results., PERMALINK: /r/Drugs/comments/f6y6fm/cwe_water_amount/

The ones I am mentioning are in the UK as far as my knowledge goes, probably elsewhere in Europe too. (oh wait.)
I've read here and there that certain brands of OTC codeine/APAP/Ibuprofen or dihydrocodeine/APAP/Ibuprofen people have used for OTC ended up harming them such as a thread where someone stated that Nurofen+ which contains Ibuprofen and Codeine had lead to the onset of an inflammatory bowel disease, due to the nSAID (ibuprofen) ingredient. This means that the CWE was ineffective. Another person stated that they had read somewhere that Paramol (7.46mg DHC/500mg APAP) was risky but nothing more. 
Any information in regards to ingredients contained within these products that we should avoid with CWE, such as binders and other additives that may interfere with the process would be much appreciated. 
Also any brands that you have experience with you think are risky do mention them and if possible explain why they may be., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/f7h2ox/i_think_we_need_a_thread_on_potentially_dangerous/

A few years ago he became very obsessive compulsive while he was living away at university. Worrying immensely over specific things that were pretty irrational for weeks and he even thinks so now. At that OCD period he would say how he was too aware. That was when he began his spiritual quest. OCD is no longer an issue for him now. He began meditating a lot and getting deeper into spirituality, becoming obsessed. All he thinks about. In his early days in this pursuit he was constantly angry at the world since becoming aware of how bad things are and I've been there. Got very depressed. He's been consistently very anxious. He seems to think himself to death.
Now, today, he is the worst I've ever seen him. He has been hearing a voice for a while now and getting intrusive thoughts that are telling him to do the opposite of what he wants to do, small things like drink some water, basically every action he does. He twitches constantly and makes these sounds, muttering and arguing with the voice in his head in distress, says he thinks he is being possessed, and that God is speaking to him. He's a mess rn. I think he will be sectioned very soon. Hope he recovers. It is very heart breaking. Does anyone have similar stories? I'm also convinced he is autistic although he was never diagnosed, he has demonstrated all of the traits.

TL;DR: Brother got into spirituality heavily and is now hearing a voice that he thinks is something possessing him. He's all over the place rn., PERMALINK: /r/Meditation/comments/hkwyzl/my_brother_is_taking_a_turn_for_the_worst/

SUBREDDIT: ketamine, TIME: 2020-09-26 11:48:45, TITLE: Beautiful first time experience with higher doses, POST BODY: So I've done ketamine a good few times over the years, but never like the other night. See, before this time, I did not have my own place, and now it is different, so I decided to go all out. At first, it was uncomfortable. I was very dissociated, a bit paranoid, and also hearing some voices (I thought people were coming to my door, but I was also so zonked out that I wasn't too anxious). Couldn't really recognise my room. Later that night, I turned off the lights and listened to music. Holy SHIT. I realise now the impact that music has on the ketamine trip. It was like a full-body massage by sounds. My body was 'warping' and being caressed by music. I found that electronic music seems to be best, like Sphongle. My legs were the part of my body mostly affected, as they would twist and turn but feel amazing. It was comparable to nodding off on opioids, but way more trippy. I could still get up and move, so I wasn't totally holed, although maybe briefly I remember just laying there feeling as if I was falling. Now visually, I remember going to this place in my head that was a cityscape (I recently moved to the city), at night with these tall trees. These dolphins/fish creatures were floating, two of them either side, smiling at me, as Freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd began to sing "I'm as free as a bird now - and this bird you cannot change". It was mesmerising, and had a cartoony feeling to it that was out of this world. I can see now how people can get addicted to this experience, but I hope to keep it to something that I will I do very sparingly. I can safely say now that I 'get' it., PERMALINK: /r/ketamine/comments/j09fj3/beautiful_first_time_experience_with_higher_doses/

So I planned to do a homebrew of some lean using some codeine pills and prometh pills. I took 220ng or promethazine and around 350mg of codeine. Anyway, I've done this before at doses of around 180mg with prometh and had mild visuals. This time I was totally out of it. I remember seeing lightning on the walls, patterns and breathing; static etc. I remember being in the kitchen at one point looking at someone sitting on the couch with some sort of pink spotted blanket on them. The next day now. I wake up and go to make some breakfast as my flatmates tells me I was fucked last night. I'm so confused by it but realise soon after what had happened. I saw the couch, and sure enough the cover for the ironing board was there . My flat mate said I had thrown it and some other objects. My other friend then tells me that he had to carry me to my room as I mumbled gibberish. I must have went outside for smoke or something. Never again.

SUBREDDIT: trees, TIME: 2020-10-06 10:02:59, TITLE: If you get weed anxiety, try CBD., POST BODY: Now it may not work for everyone, like all things. But I personally have dealt with cannabis anxiety for years, on and off, and eventually as of last year, each time I would attempt to smoke. I've tried a few different things, like l-theanine which seemed to work, also just taking a break worked for a short while (I imagine a longer break is more lasting, I only took a month off after 2 years constant smoking). Last week I bought some CBD oil, with 8 drops being about 10mg. That was not enough. Yesterday and today I tried a higher dose of 30-40mg (a heavy dose according to Psychonaut.wiki), and I have not had such a mellow high in so long that I think I finally figured it out. 

I never could afford it in the past so I just wrote it off, but it makes sense as when I looked into it, the weed that I get around here is very high in THC (like 18-25%) and basically no CBD, as there's about 1% or less in the strain. Throughout the whole gram there would be basically no CBD. Due to regulations, I cannot simply buy high CBD weed, I must take what I can get. But yeah give this a try if you are dealing with weed anxiety. For me I'd describe it as dysphoria, impending doom, negative racing thoughts, just an overall shit feeling that I'm sure has been beneficial at some points but for the most part just damaging.

Waking up multiple times a night just to stain the toilet in red, feeling like a total zombie that's incapable of even the most basic of tasks. Unable to even leave your own home to pick up groceries due to the fear of needing to go. I hope each and everyone of you find what helps the most, and for me personally... it's quitting alcohol and rebuilding my gut bacteria. And sugar. Alcohol and sugar, from my experience, have both been the leading factors determining inflammation. I believe that inflammation-causing bacteria feeds on sugar as well as alcohol. I have not drank for a week straight and already my symptoms have improved a lot. But all I can recommend is learning your body, your environmental triggers, what works and what doesn't work. The Wim Hof breathing method has seemed to had an effect too, to my surprise. This type of post has probably been repeated so many times. But I felt the need on this particularly enlightening night to just share and spread these feelings. All the love, all the power.

Already feeling some effects. Feels similar to the last time I tried it with turmeric+bp but more intense. Lots of energy and lots of vibes, stimulating. I was in a good mood going into it though.

T+ 3 Hours.
I just drank some alcohol. Feels way more MDMA-like now. Much more enjoyable than alcohol by itself. I will say before I drank, I had a bit of anxiety. My heart rate was fast, which is something I get a lot even when sober and especially when stoned. Things going on in my life I think were the main cause.

SUBREDDIT: psychonaut, TIME: 2021-01-19 18:10:16, TITLE: CANDYFLIP TRIP REPORT, POST BODY: To preface this, I have been using drugs for a few years and been addicted to many and have a decent amount of experience overall. 

This happened not long ago, and is quite funny but also a cautionary tale in a way. So I decided to try xanax again. I'm currently still dealing with addiction, and my reason for trying xanax was that I thought I could just use it for a mild high to enjoy alongside weed. I just wanted to cut down on my drug use and calm down a bit. This was not the case. 

Other times I tried xanax and also diazepam, I remember always wanting more drugs, or to get higher then taking more of the benzo. This would then lead to a blackout. Anyway, this particular day after dosing around 2mg, probably a little more later on, my inhibitions slowly lowered. 

I eventually decide, with my bartard gigabrain, that it's time to do some acid, and mdma. But not before i do some coke. So I buy 2 bags of coke, which was fucking £100. I don't even do coke for the very reason its expensive, and I'm not a huge stim lover anyway. 

After finishing the coke, that didn't hit as hard because the xans I'm guessing. I hit up the acid plug and decide on 3 tabs. I also know he has mdma, and with my inhibitions lowered decided it was time to candyflip (I've never tried this before).

I meet the guy outside in a daze, he gets out his car then gives me a small baggy. I notice the tabs aren't in there, just the mdma, and tell him. He tells me to follow him to his car, and says sorry then hands me the tabs (tried to finess?).

I place all 3 tabs onto my tongue as soon as he gives me them, and he starts to laugh. It's a little bit hazy beteen there and getting home, but eventually I'm preparing my mdma for parachuting. 

Some time passes as I'm snorting some mdma waiting for the acid to kick in. Just remembered, I was also inhaling whip cream canisters I had bought from the shop (dont think it did much. But a good example of how benzos make me into some type of drug seeking beast).

After some time, I remember joining a discord call with my two friends. I barely remember this, but they said I was snorting loudly, and kept asking them to play ranked league of legends like 20 times. 

They said I fell asleep eventually, I don't remember this. Anyway, the visuals were insane at one point. I remember being confused at why I wasn't feeling the immense mdma euphoria and I think it was because of the xanax. I remember being very confused, and the trip feeling almost like a deliriant or how people describe salvia trips. I'd see objects at the edge of my vision or the corner of my eye and think its something else, and id see something like a cup or container and, although I didn't see tiny people inside of it, I had the thought that I did? Like for a brief split second, that idea crosses my mind, then goes. 
With my eyes closed I saw gears, cogs, a lot of 3D shapes morphing and a lot of green. I remember one hallucination having this effect as if it were two pointed arcs bouncing back and fourth. I then focused on this and was able to change it into squares using my mind. At one point, I was getting visions of scrolling through my phone... I've had this before on mdma. I'm listening to music, which includes stuff like The Doors, Ween, Astrix and many more. I'd space out and get totally lost in a timeless realm. The body high was incredible. I'm lucky and glad that nothing seriously bad happened as a result of this, because it could have very well have. I asked the plug the next day about the dose of the tabs, and he says they were 300ug which I think is bs. It was definitely a strong trip either way, and had I not been on xanax maybe it could've been difficult. But either way, it wouldn't have happened at all if I wasn't on xanax.

I've read a few posts saying that it may no longer be otc and the supply is stopping or something. It's a shame, I love DHC, I feel content using it and dont feel the need to use harder drugs. The last drug I really struggled with was alcohol, I hate it and am still struggling with it now although I've cut down a lot. I'd rather do dhc as it's more functional.

The main reason why I stopped before was due to lack of supply, I could only get it from pharmacies.

SUBREDDIT: nutmeg, TIME: 2021-03-03 20:38:31, TITLE: I think I tripped a lil from a certain combination/some research, POST BODY: A lot of the info I'm about to borrow comes from elsewhere so I'll link it.

I have seen Chamomile tea recommended a few times, the first time was German Chamomile, then I discovered any chamomile is fine ( CYP1A2 Inhibition). I also used roughly a tsp (or a lil more) of the following - Basil (5-HT2A Agonist), cayenne pepper (contains Capsaicin, which supposedly synergises well with psyches through a mood boost. I didn't even know this and whenever I took it, I actually felt a subtle but very comfortable change in my consciousness. Also inhibits and induces a few differentenzymes.

Worth noting that I took all of these predose ingredients an hour before dosing the nutmeg, and dosed the nutmeg with milk (the fat is good for absorption).

I also took phenethylamine (an amino acid) capsules (500mg), 1 with my predose, another with the nutmeg, and a third later on with some exercise at some point). The reason I exercised was that someone mentioned this might be needed, as stupid as it sounds... Turns out the reason for this idea is that some users claim that when using oil TOPICALLY (on the skin), when adding drops to the thigh/upper leg, exercise actually made it work for many, helping with absorption or something. My reason for the phenethylamine is that it may serve as a building block for the supposed entactogen we are attempting to literally synthesize in your body.

I made a tea from about 3-6 grams of black peppercorn, which may or may not be better than consuming whole BP for various reasons. (slightly inhibits CYP2 and CYP3A4 significantly more). From what I've read, as the dosage of Piperine increases, it inhibits CYP2E1 even more which we don't want, as this enzyme is actually beneficial because it is necessary for hydroxylation - a process that many drugs are activated or deactivated by. CYP2E1 supposedly activates allylbenzenes, which is what Myristcin is.

I also included some cinnamon sticks in the tea, as well as cumin... The cumin I'm not sure what it could do. The cinnamon bark is a CYP3A4 inhibitor. It also contains eugenol which may have effects on 5-HT2A.

I would have definitely used curcumin and turmeric if I had them at the time. With the tea I also used 4 teabags of Chamomile tea.

Anyway, this night, the high came on way faster than normal, about 2 hours in maybe. It felt much more stimulating, I was playing games with my friend and my hand movements became very rigid and I couldn't seem to keep still, but it wasn't unpleasant. I  was quite hyperactive.

Later on that night, it kinda sucked. I just had a lot of anxiety that I am used to from my years of smoking weed. But the cool part that I actually still managed to enjoy was the visuals. Now these were like the visuals I'm used to getting from heavy doses of edibles, but way more pronounced. My room was dimly lit and with eyes closed I could see a lot of colour, shapes etc similar to what I have experienced on shrooms/LSD but it wasn't on that level quite. Anyway, it caught me off guard and I'm glad I actually had some results from experimenting lmao. Here is the link, the user also mentions Berberine, saying it appears to be a very potent activator (it has a lot of activity where we want it). The whole headspace was much more trippy as a whole.

Anyway, that being said - a few noteworthy things to take from this are:

\- Take your predose inhibitors half an hour - an hour before. Due to the long onset of nutmeg I didn't think it mattered. I'm actually going to try using the predose inhibitors before and after onset next time.

\- Chamomile, for me, made a very big impact, as does cayenne pepper.

\- The post says to dose cayenne pepper as the onset of the nutmeg begins, so I'll try that next

\- Taking more of a predose inhibitor, for example black pepper, might actually be counterproductive. This is because higher doses of Piperine = more CYP2E1 inhibition, which we don't want as we need CYP2E1 for activation

\- Filtered out black pepper tea seems better for me, could be because less Piperine = less CYP2E1 inhibition, while still benefiting from CYP3A4 inhibition.

\- There WILL be a lot of trail and error due to the variance in the dosages of multiple different ingredients, personal makeup, and I think essential oils might just be the best way to go about experimenting. So don't get disheartened if nothing much happens, if anything does consider it a bonus. And post about it lol. There are quite a lot of people though fewer that claim they genuinely trip balls from nutmeg alone, some describe it more delirium-esq but pleasant, others the same but terrible, and some even compare it to mescaline., PERMALINK: /r/nutmeg/comments/lxao6c/i_think_i_tripped_a_lil_from_a_certain/

SUBREDDIT: nutmeg, TIME: 2021-03-11 18:44:28, TITLE: I actually prefer nutmeg to weed now, POST BODY: The body high is better imo. And the headspace is clearer. Whenever it starts kicking in I always notice one of the first effects as my skin and body feeling very soft, in waves. The headspace seems much spacier than weed, and although I did used to get a lot of nice effects with music and weed, nutmeg has a slightly different effect where music just sounds like it has more depth and is richer (not to say weed has not done this too, but there is a difference I can definitely tell but not describe).
Towards the beginning I also get some stimulation, which is good for playing games or any other activity really, and my hands feel kind of rigid and stiff for some reason but it isn't uncomfortable. That passes eventually. Although recently I haven't been getting 2 day long highs, I was actually still very much high today after dosing yesterday which was nice because I didn't think I could anymore. One of the main selling points for me at this point is that I'm very likely to experience anxiety with weed, not paranoia, but anxiety that can be mild or very extreme and bordering on a panic attack. A feeling of impending doom and the world just feels terrible. I had an edible the other day and had exactly that for hours. The next day I had a comparable dose of nutmeg and there was no anxiety at all. 
For the price and sheer length of availablity, I don't see why I'd smoke instead besides just changing it up now and again. When I was fully addicted to smoking weed for 2 years, if I had known about nutmeg I'd have saved so much money. Knowing I have friends that spend so much on weed when they could just use nutmeg and not be able to tell the difference, it's weird. There are downsides like the 'hangover' if you could call it that, might be worse for some and not so bad for others (for me it's similar to weed, waking up groggy and dehydrated) and also that we don't really know the long term effects of swallowing nutmeg in the amounts we do. That being said, I wonder how the long term effects of oil extract would compare to powder., PERMALINK: /r/nutmeg/comments/m35bhd/i_actually_prefer_nutmeg_to_weed_now/

SUBREDDIT: drugs, TIME: 2021-04-04 15:48:52, TITLE: Does anyone here really enjoy the combination of opiates + deliriants?, POST BODY: I first started doing this when I began trying out promethazine with my codeine dose as a potentiator, and it's popularity with Lean. I started noticing with my promethazine doses at around 80-100mg (please PLEASE don't jump into these doses your first time. You don't know how it'll affect you if you haven't tried it), I was getting these strange visual and auditory effects. I first started noticing a pattern emerging on a concrete wall in the dark as I had a piss, and it started flowing and glowing slightly blue. I started seeing literal hieroglyphic looking shit appear on my table and other strange shit, notably the word 'remember' appearing. None of this weirdest my out at all because I knew that delirium was a thing with promethazine and being high on dihydrocodeine at the time I felt great. Closing my eyes my mind would drift off and I'd see faces morphing and people talking sometimes. Walking home was especially cool because lamposts would take a different form for a second in the corners of my vision among various other things like cars. Basically a deliriant experience except it doesn't feel like complete shit like most people says it does. I've never had a deliriant experience without an opiate so can't really talk about how they are alone, but I've done this several times and I love the combo. Feels like a really good way to enjoy a drug that is otherwise pretty shit. Really trippy shit. I did make a mistake one time of dosing ~200mg of promethazine and I had a night of full blown delirium where I was too delirious to know or care.

Lol., POST BODY: Today, my step dad seemed as if he was going to hit me. I'm 20, scrawny and small, knew he wouldn't have actually done it but I could fucking tell he was trying his best not to. He's huge btw. Anyway, this happened because earlier this week they found out that I had been using again. However, I'm stable, like I have been while being a drug addict plenty of times. I have done lots of work while using. I am generally way more productive while using. Thing is, I am also depressed, one of the reasons why I end up using to begin with. Its less than ideal, but for the sake of not wasting away with 0 motivation to do anything, I'd seriously rather use. Anyway, I got home today and had to have a talk with my stepdad and mother about the other day when they found out I was using again. It's funny, since they found out again, I have been shouted at, called names and made to feel like a piece of shit, also they make me feel bad by saying that because of what I'm doing, I'm worrying them all and worrying my dad sick. Yet, despite all this... Before they found out I was using again, there were no issues. Before I made that one little mistake the other day of my mother spotting my drug trash, nobody was worrying, nobody was arguing, nobody was making me actually feel worse to the point where I'm frustrated every day and as a result am more reckless. Today, my dad (who has temper problems lol), my step mam and my step dad all basically said stuff to make me feel like shit. My dad literally threatened to get my sectioned? They seriously think I belong there? Even though I have done nothing particularly terrible or odd that would call for something like that? I seriously don't get it anymore. In the past, I've had thoughts of taking my own life. Every time I got really bad thinking that way, I always thought of my family and how even though I'd be gone and have no clue, I wouldn't want to put my family through that. So instead I end up using. 

Just felt like venting, I'm sure plenty of you have had similar shit happen. It's so unnecessary. The consequences of being a drug addict - aren't those surely enough in their own right to act as a 'sanction' for those who choose to use? I never wanted ANY of this arguing/conflict this week.

I'm wondering this because I have been abusing it pretty much every 3 days in high doses. Doses of 400mg. Not physically dependant, just depressed and really mentally addicted/emotionally dependant on opiates. I tried some different opiates today in dates that should have gotten me very high, but I can't tell whether what I had got was weak/bunk or whether my tolerance has just shot up from this type of lope use for the past few months. Thank you.
(also the reason I've been abusing lope despite the health risks is - yes, I am a desperate junkie. But this is why I've been focusing on trying to obtain a stash of better opiates., PERMALINK: /r/loperamide/comments/ndqsju/does_abusing_this_drug_especially_shoot_your/

They could even extend and improve the overall functionality, accessibility and customization of the site for something more special. Maybe something minute like having filters for types of comments to separate the short and frequent types of comments like 'Great job man' from the longer comments with possibly more substance/feedback. As well as the more significant changes, such as the algorithm, eliminating the favourism and manipulation that YouTube suffers from.

SUBREDDIT: drugs, TIME: 2021-05-26 09:45:20, TITLE: So sick of drug user stereotypes and the ways people deal with addicts, POST BODY: I'm not going to go into detail or on a tangent here, but my god. Obviously you don't know me, I could be a total dick in real life and be the reason why its like this form me. Anyway, I genuinely feel like since my family found out I was using, with their 'help' it has been 10 times harder to quit... Just things like my step dad threatening to kick me out if I don't stop 'IMMEDIATELY'. Very hard to go cold turkey in my case and well, I didn't just stop. I just hid it like I am used to doing. I feel like as soon as your family find this shit out, they want to help but they also don't understand its not as easy as being told to stop. So instead as a result I'm still using, they don't have a clue and could actually do with help from them like maybe helping me monitor my usage and taper properly. Generally all I've had are these sporadic arguments started by them here and there, being treated differently and poorly in some cases (my brother has been the worst) and overall setting a tone that doesn't make me want to stop. It's become so much harder with the 'support' of my family. I am planning on going to a doctor soon and hopefully I can actually have a word with them about it, maybe even discuss it with my family too. Do know that, when my family found out about my use, it wasn't through me 'being in a state' or being 'fucked up'. Just made a slip up and failed to hide drug rubbish. That's the thing, they go crazy and say 'LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOUR MOTHER'. and I'm just like... What... I could be Chrissy Cocaine out on the streets mugging people for blow, or a roadman kid that walks around with a machete in nike joggers, but as a silent drug user that just wants to live normally and doesn't really get into trouble I'm made to feel like the worst human since hitler

Just annoys me that in this world, most young people that do drugs simply won't tell their family/parents. It won't happen in most cases. Is this a failure of prohibition? They'll do drugs anyway, but now instead of knowing wtf their kid is on if they find him ODing or something and being able to tell the doc, they have no clue. This taboo and lack of openness is so useless. I hope things change. I genuinely feel like whenever my parents ask me if I've been using/used, even if the answer is yes and I want to tell them the truth, I can't. Because they'll just start shouting and arguing. Genius.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2021-05-28 09:28:28, TITLE: Stimulating effects of opioids - what is the cause?, POST BODY: I always pretty much get really stimulated on opioids. I even skip sleep sometimes and feel fine all day. I don't actually know much about opioid pharmacology so any info on this would be great. Also the other end of this is the fatigue I experience upon withdrawal. I'm thinking maybe if I find out what causes the stimulation and subsequent fatigue maybe there are supplements or something I could use to reduce the fatigue. It's also pretty interesting how I get these effects when the drugs are typically seen as depressants or 'downers' and I know lots of people on here do too. That being said I've never tried heroin and heard its supposed to be a lot more sedating compared to others, then oxy is more stimulating. I've found with morphine, codeine, loperamide (horrible ik) and tramadol that I always get super stimulated., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/nmz1ot/stimulating_effects_of_opioids_what_is_the_cause/

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2021-06-01 17:17:54, TITLE: Does anyone else have experience with this? (anticholinergic + opiate combo), POST BODY: I have a combo that I do on occasions. I'm on it right now. Basically, I know that 1st gen antihistamines and anticholinergic drugs like DPH and Promethazine, also used as sleep aids, can be used to potentiate the sedating effects of opiates, especially the nod. I assume that those are the effects the majority of users are looking for, but when I try slightly higher doses I definitely started getting some of the most bizzare and coolest hallucinations I've ever seen. I've never been a user of deliriants at all besides with these combos and I feel like this is the perfect way for me to experience those drugs in a much more comfortable manner as it seems to eliminate a lot of the negative effects of the prometh. The high feels like I'm in a waking dream almost, I still have that lovely opiate feeling too but now I am seeing some the weirdest stuff, objects morphing into something else in the distance if im walking the streets at night, like a lampost becoming a person, or a roadsign. Definitely a lot more I cant' bring to mind rn but the walls have sort of lightning bolt effects but the whole trip was a confusing, dazed weird fucking mess and I'm glad I didnt die. A quite common post is a bank shop . My favourite by far has been the 'hieroglyphics'. I have seen a some more text here and there, some in English and the most memorable of them all was definitely a little text, on the coffee table in from of me that said 'Believe'...

Then other instruments began to join in, in this sort of layered mathematical kind of way. I recall people saying how 'This guy definitely did acid' or stuff like 'This is what thought loops sound like'.

I believe it's true for Methylphenidate, but I cannot comment on this for Amphetamine. Thank you., PERMALINK: /r/askdrugs/comments/ovj1p1/does_baking_soda_tums_30min60min_before/

SUBREDDIT: psychedelics, TIME: 2021-12-10 08:07:43, TITLE: Tripping to heal - Gone right, POST BODY: My life has changed a LOT recently. For years I have been struggling with substance abuse, the last 6 months or so of the addiction I was dependent on opiates. Around this time I had lost a job I only had for a week, had various instances where I blacked out on benzos or alcohol, have lied to and hurt friends and family, overdosed, and so much in between. I had been kicked out of my parent's house and moved to a hostel. It only got darker from here on. All of this while swimming in an ocean of self-pity. A very vicious cycle. Around October, shrooms were back in season. At this stage, despite how bad everything had got with my mental health and life situation, I wasn't ready for change. I didn't think I could.

My mindset was not one of hope at all during my first trip, but more of something on a whim that I thought 'fuck it, life can't get worse than this'. So I made my way up the mountain the day after that decision, and proceeded to eat as many liberty caps as I could. My first trip of the season, wasn't heavy, but it started off okay despite being pretty and eventually I realised how much I hated where I was, and how I didn't want to be like the people I was around at that point. The lack of self-respect, lack of self-care, it was all sad and gloomy. I just wanted to be back with my parents. After that day, nothing had changed, other than me sort of accepting my 'fate' and continuing to seek drugs to escape it. Another trip, I remember going to the lounge room where other residents can go. One of them wasn't being very nice to me and it made me down, so I went up to my room. Another flatmate took note and was talking to a friend of mine online that I had been speaking to earlier (they know each other). He had asked the flatmate how I was and he told him what happened, and so they both came together to reassure me. I remembered something from the previous few days, where I asked the friend if he could get me some Valium. He told me no, but he'd get me a bag of weed to keep me off the drugs (still an addict himself), showing that he cared. Upon remembering this and the reassurance of the two, I felt a refreshing wave of joy. This was a turning point. I was at rock bottom and this subtle recognition of kindness and being cared for sparked something in me. I then started remembering all of the people who do actually care about me in my life, my brothers, my parents, old friends, the one friend that stayed by my side when the others of the group stopped seeing me.

I don't think it would have been possible for me to quit without a serious change in mindset, and for me that felt like regaining my 'soul', as cliché as it might sound to some but that's seriously how it feels. I went from thinking it'd take years to feel normal and I'd never have to willpower to quit, but just like that, I no longer fiend.

I feel healthier now, and look healthier. People have started to notice which is a great feeling.

I've had an instance in the past where I 'got clean' with shrooms, but my integration, and situation was seriously detrimental to any healing process. This time I had much more of a clean slate to work with.

Its been about 3 months or so now. I did a lot of shrooms during the season since that trip, and continued to have more and more realisations and experiences that were so simple, yet so effective.

I finally stopped dwelling in self-pity, started to take accountability for my actions, and most of all regained spirit. I feel like that was WHAT was missing. During that horrible habit, I had definitely lost that. Many who have gone down that road will say the same. Feels like a rebirth. I had many low doses, where I just gained so much appreciation for what I have. To just be alive, have a roof over my head, have food, have friends and family and love. I had lost so much of that light and appreciation during my addiction. I have always been pretty empathetic, especially as a kid, but lost that over the years. It has returned now, and it feels great to be here. My motivation and drive is back, as well as my soul. Love all, peace.

It genuinely feels like the shrooms have 'guided' me, and taught me. But it does it in such a bizarre and unimaginable way., PERMALINK: /r/Psychedelics/comments/rd9fg9/tripping_to_heal_gone_right/
