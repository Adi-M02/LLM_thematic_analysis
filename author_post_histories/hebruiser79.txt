Any advice on darkweb purchases?  I'm tired of waiting for dboys that don't come back or can't be asked to use a phone.

It's an escrow buy so I imagine if it doesn't work out it'll be okay. But shit. I feel like a dumbass. It's been a long week of responsibilities and running around adulting; I was looking forward to letting loose next week. Any tips or suggestions?

I usually use a US quarter and then really grind it down with my first drivers license (with mullet and everything...). I toot with an old Turkish Lira note with Mustafa Kemal looking all Dracula on the front. It inspires me. 

You?

SUBREDDIT: DarkNetMarkets, TIME: 2016-12-06 15:50:29, TITLE: AB Vendor never shipped. What to expect?, POST BODY: I ordered some stuff from a fairly trusted AB vendor which should have been here by now.  It never arrived in the shipping window, so I opened a dispute with several days left before auto-finalize occurs.  It's a full Escrow purchase, too, if that matters.

So the vendor shows zero activity since DEC. 1st and there's no new reviews on the page.  I also have not received reply to my emails requesting tracking info.  Waiting now for the Moderator and Vendor to reply to the info I have given...and just also noticed that there are NO packages out there being delivered to my house via usps (verified via the usps website) so it appears that it either got mis-delivered or never got sent?

What are my next steps?  Is it possible to win a challenge like this and actually recover my money?

Lately, in the past week, i've been experimenting with adding Agmatine in doses of around 2g per session to my potentiation regimen.  While it is entirely possible that my glowing review is partly in my mind, i have to say that it has been a LONG time since i've nodded from 70mg of oxy (half oral and half nasal ROA).

Anyone else have experience using this chemical during opiate dosing for either augmentation of buzz or management of tolerance and/or withdrawal?

I have to stop; already lost my family and job. Don't WANT to really but that's neither here nor there.

I lost my girl of 9 years, my daughter and just the other day my parents found a pill on the floor and gave me the silent boot. Thanks in advance.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2017-04-12 17:29:36, TITLE: Starting rehab tomorrow, POST BODY: So tomorrow is the big day, where I start recovery at solutions in Las Vegas. Looks like a 30 to 45 day inpatient rehab, with an emphasis on pain management and depression/anxiety.

I've been using oxycodone for about seven years now to the point where my daily average is about 250 mg per day, which has managed to allow me to lose my family and my parents trust. And that means it's time to get better. 

Wish me luck! I don't think that I can use digital device is well there, but I've watched many of you get better, and I know the feeling of seeing success, and it's good. I hope that I have the same success!
