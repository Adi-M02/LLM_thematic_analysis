SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2018-03-27 15:15:04, TITLE: I'm ready to jump!, POST BODY: I had been back and forth trading addictions between kratom and oxy for a few years now.  Oxy habit at worst was 200 mg a day give or take, with kratom I was dosing 3 or 4x a day probably close to 30+ mg total.

I recently used a short-term (one month) suboxone taper in order to stop taking both somewhat comfortably. I jumped off subs at .5  about 10 days ago.  Been taking one dose of kratom, approx 5 grams per dose, once a day, for the last week as I got off the bupe.  I am not going to fall back into the trap.   

Anyone with experience have any advice or input as to what I can expect?  Thank you., PERMALINK: /r/quittingkratom/comments/87lqpj/im_ready_to_jump/

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2018-04-09 16:05:51, TITLE: Trying to quit booze, relapsed on Kratom, POST BODY: To combat lethargy during kratom WD, I picked up some cocaine (it found me, something always does) and used it for four days last week, which led to increased alcoholic drinking. Was just a gram of blow over 4 days. 

Regardless, I decided that my drinking vodka was a real problem. So I tapered then quit. My last drink was Saturday.  Feeling anxious and horrible, I caved on kratom, took 5 grams (10 caps) of OPMS Silver MD.  It was way too much and I felt horrible from it. I must have reset my tolerance. 

So... for the last two days, I have taken two 2.5 gram doses a day, totalling 5 grams for the day.  It's 5 PM EST here and I am going to try and not take more... today.

Work is so stressful though.  I can;t handle a shitty WD AGAIN.  I am thinking I'll remove a capsule from each dose starting tomorrow, and stick to 2x a day.   

Even though I felt like shit, I felt good to have been off kratom for over a week. The cocaine was so stupid. The drinking always is.

I told myself kratom is the lesser of two evils though.  (I was drinking about a pint of vodka a day.)

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2018-04-10 13:36:41, TITLE: Trying again. Tolerance was reset, now time to taper from 5 gpd, POST BODY: I managed to abstain from kratom for 10 days, but I stupidly used alcohol and stimulants the whole time pretty much.  Horrible idea – yes, you folks here told me so at the time. Following the binge, I craved relief and fell back.

I had dumped all my kilos and strains in trash.  My relapse has been with gas station OPMS Silver, but I am getting by on 5 caps a day (2.5 gram doses), 2x a day only. Hoping to not add a third dose. 

My plan, now that I have some stressful work situations out of the way, is to remove a capsule from each dose.  

I know this type of habit is nothing to those suffering through 30 gpd+ WD, but for context, I am only two months removed from a 200 mg/day oxy habit and a month removed from suboxone -- did a rapid taper and jumped at .5 but still had bad WD and turned to K like I always have when I swore up and down I was DONE with opiods.

I am currently only taking about 10 grams of kratom daily. Have not used my DOC (oxy) in over 2 months, and it's been over a month since my last suboxone dose.

Sadly, I turn to alcohol in increasingly unhealthy levels when I kick or cut down on opiates/kratom.  

Sigh.

I came into some ketamine. Just wondering if it may be helpful.  Was also thinking maybe I would benefit from a mushroom trip or MDMA in order to see things from a different perspective and then actually apply to me real-life problems.

SUBREDDIT: amitheasshole, TIME: 2019-02-11 12:08:06, TITLE: AITA for being pissed off at my wife for being suspicious of me, and accusing me of lying?, POST BODY: So one of my best friends and I have been discussing getting together for dinner. We were texting back and forth about finding a good BBQ spot in our area and threw out Friday as a potential date. Like any thoughtful husband and father of two little kids, I asked my wife if Friday was okay with her for me to be out.

Now for some background: a couple years ago, I was struggling with a drug addiction. This was something I came clean to her about, as I really wanted to be open and honest about it as  I needed help, and her support. However, since then, I know she doesn't trust me 100%.  Coming clean to her this time around was the 2nd time my addiction was an issue.  The first time, a couple years prior to that, she caught me discussing buying drugs by snooping through my phone.  She had thought I was cheating, but I was just an addict. Apparently I was not ready to quit when she caught me.

However, when I came clean to her on my own, I was ready, but she was crushed. She threatened to leave me, and she's been suspicious of me ever since.

I have been really good lately regarding my health. I stopped drinking, I've been watching my weight and am making positive changes.

When I asked her about going out for BBQ with my buddy, out of nowhere, she said, "What are you up to? Are you going on a drug run?! I think you are lying!"  She was straight-up accusing me of lying to her about a simple dinner out with my friend, suggesting I was making it up so I can go buy drugs somewhere.

My reaction was:  WTF?!  I was and am so pissed off at her. I can't even look her in the eye, and I don't even want to talk to her. I am hurt.  She apologized, but I am so over not being trusted.  To this day, I absolutely regret ever being honest with her. I should have kept my mouth shut and fixed my drug problem without her.  She doesn't trust me.  I came to her about my addiction two years ago, and she it still holding it against me.  I am so sick of it.  Her distrust actually makes me want to not tell her anything.  I am disgusted with her.

We were actually living together at the time.  

The reality: I was a teacher at the time, and I think she had a vision of herself with a huge bank account and all that goes with it.

She was engaged within the year of walking out on me, to a dude with TONS of family money.  Like the filthy rich type who never worked a real job ever.  She is now divorced from that guy and on to her next rich husband.  But I hear the son she had with first rich dude has "Low T".

Oh, and after she split up with the guy I got many "you were the one" messages on FB essentially feeling me out and seeing I felt the same. Fuck her. She crushed me at the time

He seemed kinda disgusted with me tbh, and probably saw me as the pill seeking addict I was, but I sincerely just wanted to sleep!

Today, even though I didnt get much sleep, I am feeling significantly better.  
Thanks for checking in.  I have only dosed 4 grams of Kratom early this morning, followed by another 3 an hour ago.  My goal is to make it through today using no more than 28 capsules.  I have used 14 so far.   Maybe I can even get away with less.  I don't want to drink either, so tonight the plan is zero alcohol.  Will lean on the vape pen if needed.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2019-06-21 12:16:31, BODY: Thanks for the reply. The details are:  running around for about 6 years, started like most with percs, realized they made mundane life enjoyable and graduated to blues.  At my worst, ramped up to 300 mg per day, that was a couple years ago. I quit with street subs then kratom and was stable on kratom for several months.

Relapsed to blues. Been on and off blues now for another year or so, always using kratom when I run out.  Bad news is, only once did I quit kratom. Which lasted two weeks. 

This most recent run, I was up to about 5 blues a day. Last pill was Monday. Felt like death all week.  Yesterday rehab seemed like the only way, but today I feel the fog lifting! Only dosed 7 grams so far and I actually feel good. 

More good news is my resolve has never felt stronger.  I've been saying I want to quit for months, fuck, years actually, but this time feels different. Maybe it is my wife catching me - again, and is still here. I want to repair all I've lost.  

I also want a new path in life in general.  With a clear head

Extracts, as much as it took, and I was still in a bad, bad fog.  I even broke down and paid almost 200 bucks to see an addiction counselor who said I need rehab. In patient.  Kind of a wake up call. But fuck that for now, not today at least...

Cause on Friday when I woke up, the fog had lifted a great deal. So I decided I need to try it again, seriously.  My plan is a kratom taper, starting at 18 GPD.  I'm not going back to the pills.  I've been wanting to get off both k and pills for 2-3 years. The time is now.

Nothing is off the table, but my plan, now that I feel kinda stable on kratom, 4 doses per day around 4 grams per dose, is to remove a half a gram a day. I'm using capsules, so its just taking out one per day.

Just believe that everyday not using kratom, or not using as much if you decide to taper, is a positive step toward recovering and getting your body and brain back.  

I'm tapering, for the first time really doing it.

POST:
SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-06-24 09:30:34, TITLE: I'm actually tapering! This is a first, POST BODY: I've been using kratom regularly for around 6-7 years.  I never had a hard time quitting, even 30 gpd habits. Reason being, I'd just switch over to 30 mg oxy blues LOL (It's funny cause it's true. No, it's actually quite sad.)

It's been a constant back and forth for years now -- use kratom to quit blues, blues to quit kratom, rinse and repeat.  All previous efforts to truly quit one or the other have been – in hindsight – really half-hearted attempts. My best run totally off blues in this time period was probably 4 month stretch where I got stable on kratom at about 15-20 gpd.  That was so long ago.

I took my last blue exactly one week ago today.  Used as much kratom as I felt I needed during the ensuing WD from oxy – opms extracts, as many as 20 MD caps in a dose. Yes, I got temporary relief.

So many times I used the bullshit "harm reduction" line to justify my kratom use.  It's legal, safe, natural, and it's not oxy or H.

This time, my resolve has never been stronger to want OFF it all.  If my wife hadn't busted me looking to cop pills I'd probably be still in the game, running around high and miserable.

I started suffering from the worst anxiety and depression of my life, and I had attribute it to the drugs and the cognitive dissonance in my head.  Wanting will all my heart to quit but not doing it, continuing to spend so much money while betraying my family.

I don't think I get another strike from my wife.  This is it.  Too many tears have been shed, too many lies and selfish acts from me.

Ugh, sorry for the rambles, feels good to type this...

OKAY, on to my taper and the current situation.

All last week I felt like human garbage, but on Friday the mental fog lifted, and that was when my taper began.  I got by on Friday on 18 grams of headshop capsules. Saturday I kept it at that same 18 g... I was thinking I'd remove a half a gram or full gram a day. But yesterday I took a half g out of each dose.   I went to a concert last night. Prior to the show I had only consumed 3 3.5g doses for a total of 10.5.  I brought 16 caps with to the show.  I hit my Indica Lemon OG vaoe pen all night and never felt the need to dose!

However, I woke up in the middle of the night in WD, and ate about 9 caps... so, counting that, and counting that for yesterday, I made it through at 14 grams. Progress!

I did NOT wake up immediately craving, probably due to the middle of the night dose.  This morning I waited much longer than usual, and at approx 9:30 AM I took just 3 grams.  I also took agmatine this morning.  I'm going to keep today at no more than 14 grams, and I'd like to drop a dose and keep it at 3 doses a day versus my usual 4.  I think I can do it.

I have agmatine, BSO, DLPA and tons of other crap from years worth of quit attempts.

Studies show all of the above affect the brain similarly with regard to dopamine.  Isn't it safe to say that it makes perfect sense that we become dependent on substances and activities simply because, for example, alcohol is a HIGHLY ADDICTVE SUBSTANCE that needs to be used with caution, and if you are not careful, you can fall into the trap of addiction.

By labeling ourselves "addicts," we play the victim.  We are diseased, so when we choose to relapse, we allow ourselves to go off the rails once again – after all, it's who we are.

But what if we simply make the right choices, and avoid things that are dangerously addictive., PERMALINK: /r/addiction/comments/c4pmg8/you_are_not_an_addict_you_have_an_addiction/

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-06-24 10:52:14, BODY: Makes sense. And it sounds like we are in similar situations. The good news for me, is that my wife knows I am off oxy and now working on quitting kratom.  I can't go back to the blues.  But if I am being honest, here at work, right now, my cravings are through the roof.  I can't get work done – just reading about addiction and recovery and tapering and quitting. 

I just felt overwhelmed with anxiety and what is probably phantom back pain, so I took my second dose of the day – 7 caps, or 3.5 grams.  So, at noon, I'm at 6.5 grams on the day.  A little dissappointed in myself but still progress knowing where I was week ago and even 3 days ago sucking down opms extract. 

Okay, so the way I see it, today is a good day if I can keep my dosing below 14 grams.  I figure I have 7.5 grams to play with, so to speak.  If I can do less, great, if not and I land on exactly 14 grams, I won't be so hard on myself.

And I hate it, and I long for my brain to be in its pre-addicted state--- like when we were goods and looked at the world with wonder. Innocence.

I recently read the book "This Naked Mind" which deals with quitting alcohol.  It makes some great points, ideas I can get behind, blaming the substance, not the person.  I kind of had an "Ah-Ha!" moment when I thought about how alcohol is so, so addictive. And for someone like me, who enjoys and always has enjoyed getting short-term pleasure, it stands to reason that I would get hooked if I wasn't careful. And I wasn;t careful. To me, I was just partying... same with my DOC, oxycodone, I was just having a good time and it made me feel good.

I got caught in the trap. I have an addictive personality, so therefore I should avoid addictive substances. Common sense, though of course easier said than done.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2019-06-24 14:05:15, BODY: Wow.  I feel so much better than I did yesterday and all of the days before.  Today marks 1 full week since swallowing my last Blue 30.  On Friday, the brain fog began to lift.  Today, the achiness and lethargy is markedly improved.

I have begun my kratom taper.  Only 7.5 grams so far.  Goal is to keep it under 14.   Friday, when I started tracking grams, I had 18, Saturday 20, and Sunday only 14!   Going to try and stabilize or better on 14.  I had a few beers both Saturday and Sunday night, but nothing crazy.

I turned down blues today for the first time in a year. Deep breath.   
I just read your post from 12 days ago where you list all those things we need to remember, from the morning arthritis to the impacted shit. Oh the lying. So many lies... Well done, and hopefully I can get where you are soon.

I feel like I'm close to breaking through but I know i have a long way to go. I'm clean but not. I'm still using kratom as MAT, always my own doctor self-medicating.  But for once I have a plan and it includes tapering and quitting kratom. Enough of the harm reduction bullshit I fed myself for years.

But yesterday I also said no to scoring the pills that have been a daily crutch for me for a long time.  I got the text. It would have been real easy. But I'm choosing to stop taking oxycodone. 
This is the same day I took the smallest dose of kratom I've ever took.  I'm actively and aggressively tapering kratom for the first time. 
Maybe I'm wrong and one day admitting I am powerless will be my thing.  But I just made good choices, and who is stay I can't continue that... ?

What gpd did you finally jump at?

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-06-25 09:59:50, BODY: Really appreciate the advice.  I'm going to focus on lowering my dose every day moving forward, and when I succeed in doing that it will be a win.  Only 3 grams today so far.  Compounding this quit is probably the fact that I have used kratom and oxy somewhat interchangeably for 6+ years, having only taken a 10-day break once in that time, and I used stims those days.  So I'm really feeling the drop, but I guess that means I am quitting; like, the time is now and I am doing it.

For reference, a week ago today I was in the throes of 120-150 mg/day oxy WD, and taking as much as 7-8 gram kratom doses as well as headshop extract.  I quickly moved to crushed leaf capsules, and here I am...

I'm done buying from vendors, because I want to be DONE, so I re-upped with OPMS Silver.  However, I have only had 6 grams so far today.  Yesterday and the day before I had 14 grams/day.  My goal today, which I am on pace to achieve or exceed is 12 grams.

I hope it's progress.

One thing that I think is helping a great deal is Ambien at night for sleep.  Not being sleep deprived may be a difference maker.

FWIW, weed is really benign – not physically addictive, inexpensive, and MUCH safer than alcohol and other drugs.  Not even close. She may benefit from being educated about cannabis.  And this is coming from someone with drug and alcohol issues.

I think that means I'm ready to drop lower or it simply speaks to the less is more idea with kratom is real and my tolerance is actually lowering. 
I'm currently lying in bed after 5 hours sleep contemplating my course of action, which will be: 1000 mg of agmatine with my coffee, BSO and some other add supplements, then a lower dose of 2.5 grams. Let's see what happens.

I’ve been in the oxy game for 6 long years now, or something like that. While I have strung together weeks and even months oxy-free, I always binged kratom to stay well between runs, and have always always gone back to my DOC, blue 30s, as many as 10 a day at my worst and up to 6-7 during this last run. 
This time things feel different. I’m taking kratom but for the first time ever I am actually actually actually tapering and I have a plan to quit.  Only took 2.5 grams this morning and I feel fucking normal. The fog has lifted. Goal is to keep today’s total dose to 12 grams or less. A week ago I was downing 2 opms shits per day plus so much more. The r/quittingkratom sub is very very helpful.

Sounds like you are weighing out your doses which is great.  I am using headshop caps since I swore long ago I was quitting and stopped ordering from a vendor. 

Trying not to be too hard on myself... just 11 days ago I was eating 100+ of oxy a day, so maybe I am still kinda detoxing from that.  I've been using oxy--&gt;kratom--&gt;oxy---&gt; kratom for about 6 years, guessing more kratom than oxy.  Will keep plugging away.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2019-06-28 07:35:20, BODY: ELEVEN days since my last roxy.  Been tapering my kratom usage and the plan is to kick that forever as well. I am doing a slow taper, as I need to function both at home and work.  The last two days I think my dropping the dose caught up with me – anxiety was through the roof.  

Today however, I feel like it's lifted somewhat. It started coming on but not right away. I have been up since 5 and held off dosing until 7:30. I have been taking ambien for sleep, which works for me, and I think getting sleep has been quite valuable. (I am not prescribed – I actually trade kratom for ambien with a co-worker).

 I took my 3 gram morning dose and I am actually being productive at work.  Could it be I am actually making progress the more I distance myself from the oxy?  I was of the belief that both the kratom and oxy were somewhat one and the same when it comes to causing me anxiety and depression... but maybe things are finally looking up?

She asked how she could help me, and I told her she should check in with me daily about my progress and how I am feeling.  She won't, if history is any indication, but I wish she would. She actually asked though if I was using anything other than kratom, as if she didn't believe me.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2019-06-29 07:25:15, BODY: Just forgive yourself and move on. When we are hooked on opiates, the need to have our fix, just to stay well, becomes a basic need, like water and food. The brain changes and literally need it to survive. Now, you acknowledge how messed up it is what you did. You are better than that now.
There are some lies I’ve told and things I’ve done that I plan on taking to my grave.  When nothing good can come from fessing up, what’s the point?

Just took my morning dose of 3 g.
Today will be a challenge if I want to remain single digits, back to work and the whole routine, plus the challenges at work I need to be on point for.

But I have to remember it is just a craving.  I am going to try and hold off until at least 2 pm for my second 3 G dose.  I'm hoping if I can pull through I'll have successully cut my dosing from 4 to 3 per day, at three 3 grams each.  Gonna try.

And your statement that "Weed can kill an addict just as easy as crack" is simply incorrect.

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-01 12:00:47, BODY: I'm in the process of quitting, and my wife knows.  She's known about the kratom addiction for awhile now.  She never knows what I am on, she says, and correctly always assumes I am on something.

I brazenly did my kratom for long stretches out in the open, telling her it's harm reduction and satisfies my itch for opiates. After all, I discovered kratom while searching for oxy withdrawal remedies.  I am really excited to finally quit kratom. I am no longer making excuses for kratom, and I am actively tapering and sharing my progress with her.

What's it like now?  It's strained but better.  She has caught me in too many lies about drugs – me relapsing on oxy – too many times.  She simply does not trust me.  I thought she might leave me, or kick me out, but she loves me and is still gonna hang on to us.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-01 12:10:02, BODY: No, I did you what did – replaced oxy with kratom; and sometimes alcohol as well. Booze is also an issue with me.  But my problem is I couldn't just keep it to kratom.  I have always gone back to oxy.  This is after she busted me 4 years ago... since then I came clean once about a relapse – when my addiction was REALLY bad – and she also flat-out busted me twice since.  (Reading texts about scoring pills.)

So I am on borrowed time.  The only difference is now I really truly want OFF of both oxy and kratom forever.  For ME.

So only 5 kratom capsules.  Last 3 days I've made through at 6x3 for 18 caps (9 G) total.
TBH, I am feeling pretty antsy right now.  I want more k to feel better but I am going to try and hold off.  So verdict isn't on Ag, but I have a lot going on at work and I am pretty anxious about it.  I feel pretty anxious right now.  Sigh.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: kratom, TIME: 2019-07-03 11:59:16, BODY: I discovered kratom many years ago while going through the hell of oxycodone withdrawal. If you have ever been in withdrawal from a rather large and pronounced daily opiate addiction, you know it's an absolute living hell when you are in the thick of it. You'll do anything to make it stop – anything – which makes it so hard to detox and quit.

Kratom takes away that suffering. The suffering is so immense, that I can only describe the relief of the symptoms as somewhat euphoric. When you feel sick as hell and want to die, but then suddenly you feel GOOD... that's euphoric.

Divorce I could handle.  Fuck, if it weren't for the kids we'd have been dunzo a long time ago. 
Thankfully I've been given a reprieve, and another chance to get right.  
Oh, and if she followed through and left me, 100% chance I would have gone much further down the opiate rabbit hole. Without question. In fact, mid conversation I think I was plotting getting more pills.

I had gotten down to 9 gpd.  But all of the aforementioned stressors had me fiending. And pissy.  So two nights ago I drank. A lot.  But i didn't take more k that i had allotted.  Stuck to the 9. 
Yesterday however i took a step backwards, probably dosing 2-3 grams more. I was hungover and said fuck it.
But I slept a lot last night.  Back on decent terms with the wife. I chilled with cannabis, no drinking at all. 
Today I'm back on track.  Took a cap off my am dose. 5 caps now per dose is the plan, 3x a day... which would put me at 7.5 gpd if I can pull it off.

If you are dead seton  being done by Tuesday, I don't think you can avoid discomfort.  However the fact that you are not using for very long is really in your favor and should help.
I suggest tapering as much as possible before you jump off CT.  
I think it will also be much easier if you can take more time to taper.
If not, and you have access, those ativan pills will give a long way the first couple days if you cant sleep due to RLS and anxiety. 
Cannabis will also help a lot. And activity and exercise are your absolute best allies. Good luck

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-09 06:30:53, BODY: Wow.  Yesterday. I took the absolute least amount of kratom I have had in YEARS.  I made it through the day at only 6.5 grams!  I credit not working and weed to the success, but 6.5 is 6.5.  
I may have taken too much magnesium last night before bed being how I had to run the bathroom this morning, or maybe that's also due in part to dropping 3 grams in 2 days.
Regardless, this morning I am craving, and I just took 2 grams.  Let's see how the day goes back to work.

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-11 08:51:37, TITLE: I got into a really bad car accident, POST BODY: FML.  I've been tapering from about 25-30 gpd. On Monday I took only 6.5 grams. Tuesday morning I took only 2 grams. My lowest doses of kratom or opiates in general in 7 years!! I was seeing the end in sight. 

Tuesday afternoon I, after only taking 2 grams in the am, I left work to get lunch.  Was making a left turn and WHAM. Head on collision. Long story short, I was airlifted to a hospital, there was a ton of blood, I came to in the passenger's seat after my head was thrown about the car.  

The good news, I'm alive and not paralyzed.  They also say I don't need surgery. But I need to be in a very restrictive neck brace for 6 weeks. I'm going crazy already and want to rip it off. More good news is i haven't taken kratom since that 2 mg Tuesday morning dose. 

The bad news, I've been given fentanyl, dilaudid, neurontin, baclofen and now oxycodone, 10 mg every for hours. I guess those meds make it really easy to quit kratom. 

Of course you know how I discovered kratom in the first place.  A recreational oxy addiction.

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-11 14:01:57, BODY: Not prescribed fentanyl. That was just in the ER.  Dilaudid was IV my first night in hospital.  Now I'm on 10 mg of oxycodone every four hours or as needed. 
I'm getting released tonight, thankfully. I hate it here. 
I have to wear a neck brace and its driving me fucking crazy.  I'm nasty right now. 
I imagine I'll be prescribed to go home with oxy, gabapentin, baclofen, an antibiotic, and I'm going to beg for a benzodiazepine and a sleeping pill.  I'm literally going crazy. 
My wife is all over me about the oxy. I promised her she could administer it to me. But I'm triggered right now.  All I want is to be numb.  
The timing of this event is laughable... I'd just gotten down to 6 gpd

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-11 14:04:05, BODY: My wife already told them I'm a recovering oxy addict.  But my plan is to only take as prescribed.  I'm so miserable though, as I have a tolerance to opiates so it's not really touching the pain.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2019-07-15 09:18:26, BODY: One of my main issues when stopping opiates/kratom is suffering from extreme lethargy.  Stims like  Concerta, Adderall and even cocaine do help with the fatigue, IME, but then I always feel uncomfortably jittery and on edge, and coming down I inevitably turn to alcohol and definitely crave k or opes or benzos.
So if you want to use stims, use with extreme caution.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2019-07-16 18:03:49, BODY: I know that emptiness feeling well. Been battling a 7 year long oxy addiction, peaking at around 300 mg a day and most recently 200 mg/day. However I'd been Opiate/oxy free for over a month, had successfully stabilized on kratom, and was actively tapering the kratom... then I got in a very serious car crash last week where I broke my neck.  Crazy, right? Life is fucked.
So I've been back on opiate painkillers, some prescribed, some self prescribed, and I'm going to have to get off very soon. I cant go back to where I was with the oxy.
But in addition to the pain meds I've been prescribed both gabapentin and baclofen.  Hoping the gabs will help me come of the oxy.

At least for me, when I have succeeded in not drinking or taking opiates, it helps me to take it one day at a time or even one minute at a time.  The whole finality and absoluteness of saying "never" can I have this made me a little crazy. 

Wishing you all the best.   Weed makes me anxious a lot as well.

And what's great is that you never have to have that anxiety ever again!!

When I was a kid, I was taught that my mail was mine, and to be only opened by me.  I’m married for 7 years. My wife has always taken it upon herself to open anything addressed to me. I’ve asked her several times to not do this. She just doesn’t get it, and the other day I really lost my temper. I have not been well, and someone sent me a get well card. I was literally in the other room. And wife calls out, “Who is so an so?” I said, “Someone I work with, why?” Oh, she sent you card.

I went to the room she was in and just about lost it. WTF.  I get maybe if I was out of town or something... but I was ten feet away and she could have handed me the envelope!  Her response is, we are married and what’s the big deal and what do I have to hide, etc. 

Did I give up my right to simple privacy when I got married? Am I the asshole for insisting that only I should open up the mail that is addressed to me?, PERMALINK: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cgih9b/aita_for_being_pissed_at_my_wife_for_opening_my/

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2019-10-15 12:35:07, TITLE: How would you use these meds to detox and quit?, POST BODY: So once again I am ready to leave my opiate addiction behind – for good.

Backstory: I was almost done in July. Had switched to kratom and only kratom and was actively tapering. I was down to about 8 grams day when WHAM – got into a head-on collision and broke my neck. Luckily no spinal damage. Just pain and discomfort and a neck brace for 7 weeks.

Naturally, I got back into the vicious cycle, and have ramped up to about 7 blues a day (so give or take I am at around 200 mg/day habit.  And I hate it.  I am suffering and so too are my relationships.

Here's what's in my toolkit.  Any advice on how you opiate pros would use the following will be greatly appreciated:

1 8mg sub strip, 1 8 mg sub pill, around 60 300 mg gabapentin caps, kratom, 5 xanax bars, about 20 10mg baclofens, about 10 5 mg ambien, weed (indica vape).

Thank you. I'd like to be done with opiates, that includes kratom, but I am fine with a somewhat gradual process but no more than 2 months.  Not going to get more blues., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/dibbs7/how_would_you_use_these_meds_to_detox_and_quit/

Opiate addiction is a real motherfucker, and only those that have been through it understand.   I've been in withdrawal so many fucking times it's ridiculous.  So many "last times."... but when, despite us KNOWING right from wrong, we cave... to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal.  We romanticize the pills.

Chi-guy.  I have so much respect for what you are doing.  I am embarking on quitting myself... upwards of a 200+ mg/day oxy addiction.  My wife knows of so many runs and relapses, and this time I just don't have it in me to come clean to her AGAIN.  I don't think I'd get another chance.  I've got the house, the 2 kids, the good life.  I need to just be content with the boring and the mundane.  I miss the old me, who I was without the opiate addiction.  Vent over.  Thanks for listening.  Stay the course.  Remember the pain of withdrawal.  We cannot use now and again.  If we have the pills, we are simply eating them every day.  Fuck oxy.

My car accident and broken neck injury totally derailed me and sent me back... way back to active oxy addiction and alternating with 25-30 gpd kratom usage. I'm pretty disappointed with myself, but I'm ready once again to set a straight and stronger course. 

I'm tapering again and considering a CT jump. I keep making excuses.  Neck pain, work and dad responsibilities, anxiety, weakness.  I've been off oxy for a bit but back on kratom and some low dose sub, but struggling nonetheless.

It's been a long, dark road... about a 7 year addiction.  Currently using kratom and low dose sub. Only have a few mg sub left.  I really want to leave it all behind.   Over the summer I had almost quit it all, was tapering down to 7 g kratom a day then got into a bad car accident and before I knew it was back to 200+ mg oxy/day. Always switched to kratom when the pills ran out.

My plan is for next dose, as needed, to be .5, see if that stabilizes me, and then move to .25 after a few days or if I can even skip days.  I want to close this chapter of my life in the worst way.  I want my wife and kids to know me.

After reading so many suboxone withdrawal horror stories, it's refreshing read of someone feeling better after 10 days of hell.   12 mg is a helluva jumping off point. I have no perspective having never taken more than 8 mg/day.

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2019-11-29 08:32:13, TITLE: I'm 10 days clean from DOC and even kratom, and my wife is mad at me., POST BODY: Fuck. This. Shit.  She doesn't trust me, how could you go near that stuff again... how can I ever trust you blah blah blah.  

You know how I could near it? The blues?? Cause I broke my fucking neck in a car accident in July.  At the time I was tapering off kratom after a several years addiction to oxy and kratom. I was done.

Then wham, the car accident.  I was in pain and housebound and depressed.  For months.  I left the hospital with 12 5mg pills.  Fuck that.  I advocated for myself. I found my medication, what I needed to get through the days and nights.  

Then I recovered somewhat and went back to my job that I despise.  A few more blues binges, and kratom and a few subs here there.  Last week I suffered in silence.  I got some sort of virus and with some xanax I rode out the suffering of withdrawal.  

She couldn't figure out why I was a zombie. I broke down and told her.  Instead of being PROUD of me... I am free of the horrible acutes!!... I quit kratom and oxy hopefully for real this time!! To her I'm just a lying junkie who she'd have divorced long agonif it weren't for the kids.  Can't win.   You bet I wanna use right now.  Hey honey, how about celebrate with me a little?  Acknowledge how hard opiate addiction is? Oh, that's right, you have no idea...all you probably have your suburban cunt friends suggesting you leave my ass.  Well fuck you.  Im not leaving.

SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2020-08-24 12:19:33, TITLE: Sneaky puke this morning, POST BODY: I woke up earlier than I wanted to.  I do this thing when I drink vodka.  I sneakily guzzle at night, you know, while just existing with the family as I nurse a few beers.  I always get drunker than I set out to, and I pass out with my son while putting him to bed.  

Then I wake up between 1-3, usually, with a terrible headache and a slight case of "the fear." Then I'll sneak downstairs and take a massive slug, and wash down a pill of some sort, if I had – ambien, xanax, valium, anything to help me back to sleep.  Well last night I chose ambien and then decided to stay up a little – an extra couple slugs.  

Then, if you know ambien, I ate. A lot.  I recall having the wherewithal to eat 3 advils, so when I awoke for the day, the excruciating headache would be minimal.  I'm all out of opiates, which, of course, is a cure-all for everything.  

I must have passed out around 3, but I woke at friggin 6!  I wanted to sleep til 8 or 9, so like the CA I am I went back to finish the Smirnoff with another nibble of alprazolam.  Did that.  Back in bed.  Oh great, now my wife is up.

All that junk I ate, all that vodka, I couldn't fall back to sleep now, and it was also swishing around in that really green way.  Puke was-a-coming, but I couldn't let the old lady hear it.  All my benders have been ending in puking fits lately, and I'm not supposed to be on one.  She doesn't approve of the lifestyle, rightfully slow.   

She's awake on her phone. House is small, can hear everything from every bathroom.  So I quietly snuck outside to the back yard and unloaded my gross guts.  Then had to get the hose and wash the ground before the sun started baking it. That would be gross.  I tried spreading it all around with the hose water. Then I had to hide my sweats into the washing machine as they got splattered, then the breath.  No more vodka, which is good.  Thankfully the 1 mg of xan is wearing off.

What a life.  Tonight, I'll say, just a couple light beers, and that's it.  Remains to be seen if I procure another sneaky pint... but I am tired of the sneaky pukes., PERMALINK: /r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/iftb71/sneaky_puke_this_morning/

We start to think we are our best selves while using. Personally, I forgot what and who I am before opiate addiction. So our junkie brains start rationalizing use, telling us we are better high than not high on opiates.
I've strung together a few weeks and months somewhat clean, but always slip, sadly. Will keep trying. 
So sorry for your pain and loss.

Meanwhile, I have zero motivation to do my work.  I don't want to work.  I'm tired of doing things that are essentially meaningless.  I do writing and editing in the B2B field.  I'm over it.  I want to help people, I want to better the world. I want to be on my feet, outside, and not tied to a computer.  Time for change.  And to complicate things, I continue to battle my addictions – both alcohol and opiates/kratom have been a thorn in my side and I'm trying to break these chains.  So, I'm suffering.

I mean, what is better for a hangover than a blue?  Nothing, that's what.  So if you are going to go that route, make sure you have kratom on hand for the hangovers at least, and maybe some ibuprofen.

They go for about 20 bucks each at the head shops – these tiny  8 ml bottles of OPMS extract.  They taste nasty, but they are very effective.  I'll use them through the 2-3 days during the worst of the acutes, and then switch over the plain leaf.

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2020-09-24 15:49:05, BODY: I have fucked with those shots and gotten off them.  I suggest gradually (or quickly) switching to plain leaf, and then tapering or CT from there.  That's what I did, and it was relatively smooth transition.  Good luck.

Really. Switch to plain leaf capsules.  If the store is selling shots, they're selling caps. Move on to capsules and taper. You can remove a cap from each dose.

The shots are strong -- by my estimation they are 10-12 gram doses each, with god knows what other additives.  Caps are .5 grams each, so do the math, and get off that crap.

SUBREDDIT: quittingkratom, TIME: 2020-09-25 09:26:57, BODY: Well done!  I second how good MJ is as a "helper med."

For me, high CBD tinctures and edibles and Indica dominant tinctures and edibles are best.  

I wonder if the reason I strongly prefer ingesting cannabis vs smoking it is because it satiates part of the routine we've grown accustomed to of eating a drug (kratom) and then having that 30-60 min of "come up" and then it takes effect.

Know what happened? I could no longer get it up for her. ED, and it was devastating as there was nothing wrong with me physically.  

I went to therapy, and had it explained that the ED was my body's way of protecting myself, my heart from being broken again by this person.

A fretful frown and spoil the mood  
‘Cause though I never really stand that tall  
She tilt my frame, she watch me fall

SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2021-03-26 15:05:12, BODY: OP, I'm the same way.  Oxy is my DOC but my habit became unsustainable.  Literally had a 100-200$ per day pill habit and I was going to lose my family.  

While drinking sorta scratched the itch, hangovers beg for opiates.  I did that for a loooong time.   Drink like crazy, and with pills you get a get out jail free card from feeling like death.  

Kratom is a daily thing for me

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2021-03-26 17:29:59, BODY: No, not really.  I usually take kratom by day and don't drink til evening. I also tapered down to less than 10 gpd, so there's that.   

I've been mixing opiates/kratom and booze pretty regularly for about 8 years.  But my thing with opies is not about nodding... I hate the nod.  It's the energy and euphoria I adore.

SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2021-07-26 12:16:18, TITLE: How I drink; and I just fall asleep, POST BODY: Longtime FA, sometimes CA here.  I think I'm doing it wrong, well, I know I am, but in the boozy world the lines between right and wrong sure are blurred, right? Here's how I drink:  Buy vodka and beer. Fill my mouth up with vodka, swallow, chase with beer (or some other non-vodka/non-water beverage. Allgood, right? 

Well, here's what happens:  I just fall asleep.  I can't hang in the pocket, the sweet spot, anymore.  And I am trying not to do this. I seldom buy anything more than a pint these days, cause I know what I'll do with the fifths and liters... so I try and be responsible.  

But even less than a pint will put me out, if I drink it all within 2-3 hours or so.  And I usually only get through a couple beers or so if I'm pulling slugs from the plastic pint.  Even a half pint lately is putting me to sleep.  

Not quite sure what any of this means. I'm in my mid 40s and been swigging like this since my early 20s, and this wasn't always the case. On the bright side, I am usually browned out before finishing my pint, thus leaving me with a healthy swig during the inevitable 2:34 AM wakeup / panic attack. 

That is all.  I would like to stay awake, and I have no issues when I just stick to beer alone.

SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2021-07-26 15:35:03, BODY: I'm awake all day as I typically don't start til 6-7 pm. Sometimes, if I have nothing going on, or a particularly raging hangover, yes, a pint will knock my ass out for 3-4 hours and it's quite nice.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2021-07-26 15:37:48, BODY: Thanks for this reply. I do appreciate it.  I know I am due for a bloodwork thing and a doctor's visit.  What you mention makes me nervous and I have had that thought, that my organs aren't quite processing things the way they should. 

I keep wanting to string together 2-3 weeks of good behavior prior to a check-up, but I struggle to even have  a day or two alcohol-free. 

I guess I should be grateful I can sleep.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: addiction, TIME: 2021-07-27 13:53:06, BODY: Don't be ashamed at all, I totally understand.  My ex-GF died from computer duster. Not telling you that to scare you, but you really need to be careful. She had a seizure, was in a coma, and eventually passed.  Seized up right in the store buying more... anyway, that's neither here nor there...

The good news is, your DOC is not physically addictive, but it sure is psychological. I'm no expert, but I know there is a way out.  Personally, I take a harm reduction approach as I don't think total abstinence is feasible for me, or what I want.  There are many less harmful substances you can use when you feel that intense urge to get high.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: addiction, TIME: 2021-07-27 14:22:07, BODY: Have you tried kratom?  I use it daily.  I had a crippling addiction to oxy, for years and years, and I was able to beat it using kratom and harm reduction. I also use cannabis and together both help immensely with the cravings. In addition to eating right and, most of all, exercise.

It's not a conspiracy. What do you think of Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA director and asshole who made it his mission to get kratom banned? 

For years, Gottlieb  worked for Big Pharma. In 2015, he received nearly $200,000 from four large pharmaceutical companies — including giant GlaxoSmithKline — for consulting, travel and making speeches, according to the most recent figures in a public database.

I read nothing in the OP about meth or hallucinations. 

Sure, there could be some extenuating circumstances, but on the surface, refusing to even speak with your sibling because he/she got drunk 2 times in 13 months is excessive and cruel, especially if the person is truly trying to be better.

SUBREDDIT: onlinegambling, TIME: 2022-02-16 14:55:40, TITLE: Question about online slots, POST BODY: So I live in NJ where it's all legal and regulated, and I'm hooked on slots. 

My question:  When I am playing slots on one of the many sites (BetMGM, Draft Kings, Borgata, Golden Nugget, etc), am I spinning the wheels through a server that the online casino owns? Or does it go from my phone to the casino, and then to the slot maker's server, like IGT, BTG, NETENT, etc?

TIA, PERMALINK: /r/onlinegambling/comments/su65wh/question_about_online_slots/

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: onlinegambling, TIME: 2022-02-16 16:54:30, BODY: Interesting. Thanks for answering. Guess this explains the times I've had technical issues and had to wait for the slot vendor to address it. 

So when I'm playing Bonanza, for example, it's spinning at Big Time Gaming's stuff and not the casino. 

Hmm... not sure how I feel about this.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: onlinegambling, TIME: 2022-02-16 17:39:54, BODY: Yes, definitely makes it more fair, so long as the hosting site is on the up and up.  All the sites boast how they're audited. 

I swear sometimes it seems like the games are "set" to be loose or extra tight or give out a big winner, but I suppose it all balances it out.  I could go through 2 grand and not get a single bonus, and them another session I'll spell GOLD 4 times in 20 minutes. 

Thanks for the insight.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: cripplingalcoholism, TIME: 2022-02-17 10:20:20, BODY: I've played that game many, many times – the buying of the same bottle and guzzling it down to around the amount it was at when previously seen. 

I've also begged my wife once to dump it out before I got hime once – during a moment of clarity.  She couldn't understand why, but she eventually did.  

Now it's frowned upon and also understood that when I buy a regular sized bottle, shit's going down. Down my throat and into my gut, filling me with both warmth and dread and relief and more dread. 

So I hide, often.  And I also buy airplane bottles and sneaky plastic pints and when I'm being good I stick to beer.  I am not good all that often these days.

Another thing you can do is buy a bottle for you, the CA, while not touching the showpiece that you share with your man.

I know this will be downvoted by some, but you have the option of using kratom to help your withdrawal symptoms. It's addictive in its own right, but if you are so miserable in WD and you can't function, it's a safe, legal (usually), affordable tool to get you through the worst.

Something happened, and it wasn't good.  Yesterday... or late Saturday and all day Sunday, my body decided to reject everything – violently. I puked quite a bit – violently.

No big deal, right? Wrong.  Now I have this things where my uvula (sp?) is all inflamed and my throat is killing me and it feel likes there is something in the back of my throat that wont come out.... cause it's my dangling, inflamed and injured uvula. I am so uncomfortable, coupled with the terrible depression that comes with taking molly/sass
