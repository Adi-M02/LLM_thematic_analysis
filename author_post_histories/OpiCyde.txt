SUBREDDIT: watercolor, TIME: 2018-06-03 20:58:57, TITLE: 100% New to art. Seeking guidance., POST BODY: Greetings /r/watercolor!



So I read the entire thread and watched all of the accompanying links from the sidebar regarding “beginners watercolor” but not only is that thread quite dated, it still seems a bit advanced for me.



I have literally never drawn, sketched, painted - nothing. Is this hobby far and above someone like me? I have always loved watercolor art but never believed I could do something like that. I am finding myself in need of a hobby to keep myself from other, less productive pastimes. 



If anyone can direct me to information regarding literally the most basic things, such as how to place the paper when I am going to paint, how to clean the brushes, how to dry the work, etc. I’m also hoping there are some “beginner” steps I can take since, as I’ve noted, my ability to even draw is below that if a 1st grader (not hyperbole). Do I just practice techniques first before trying to actually create an image? Jump into trying to make an image? Just do abstract stuff?


I feel both overwhelmed and excited. Thanks in advance for whatever information you’re able to provide.

SUBREDDIT: depression, TIME: 2018-06-14 07:14:35, TITLE: Opened up to wife about my depression and anxiety., POST BODY: So my psychiatrist has been recommending for a long time that I open up about my struggles with suicidal thoughts, my panic attacks and depression. I finally decided the other night, in the midst of an oncoming panic attack, to ask for help and open up. 






It could not have gone any worse.





When I described my anxiety she told me “everyone has that you just have to get past it”. I tried explaining that I don’t think everyone constantly envisions the gruesome, suffering deaths of their loved ones every day but it was lost on her.





When I told her I think about killing myself every day she told me “well you have to fix it”. I was devastated. I am devastated. I thought opening up to my wife was the right thing to do but all it’s done is make me want to close off even more. 





I don’t know what I was expecting by telling her, exactly, but it wasn’t to be dismissed.  I’ve spent the last couple days trying to decide where the best place to OD would be where she or the kids wouldn’t have to find me. It’s been a rough week.

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2018-09-05 22:10:53, TITLE: Losing my grip on my recovery and life., POST BODY: I used 30mg of Oxy every day for a year and it worked wonders for my anxiety and depression. One pill, once a day. No different than an antidepressant, I thought. I'd found the cure. The way to feel happy, finally, after 36 years wondering why I couldn't just 'be like everyone else'. 




But of course it finally escalated. It always does, right? 30 became 60 became 90 became 120 and soon enough I knew I was spiraling. 


So I went on suboxone. I found a psychiatrist and have followed every order. Not relapsed, stayed 'sober'. Took every medication prescribed to me dutifully. I've started exercising. Now he wants me to try NA. I've been looking up meetings but every online one I tried is inactive. I looked up in person meetings and there's nothing close to my house. 


And the worst of it is every day seems a little worse than the day before. Everything I read says I'm supposed to start feeling better but it just isn't happening. Instead I feel more empty and more desperate with each passing day. 


I don't really know what the point of this post is. Maybe to just vent. But I'm trying. God knows. I'm really doing all I can. But I'm starting to unravel. I'm not this strong. I thought this would be long enough to start feeling normal again and it just isn't happening. I don't have years in my to continue this fight. I have so much respect and admiration for those of you who have seen the light at the end of the tunnel but I just...don't. 

I have a stash waiting for me. I know that I can take some of it and feel 100% in a matter of minutes. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm trying my best but I don't think my best is going to be enough. I hope they know I tried. I hope they know I sat up night after agonizing night crying alone in the bathroom. Hoping that I would find strength. Hoping that I would make it and become the person they all think I am. Somehow. But it isn't happening. 

I think it might be time to throw in the towel. There's no one left to disappoint. What a bitch this is, addiction. I never knew. I wish I never learned. , PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/9de6n4/losing_my_grip_on_my_recovery_and_life/

SUBREDDIT: tianeptine, TIME: 2018-11-24 19:39:46, TITLE: Tianeptine &amp; Suboxone, POST BODY: I’ve scrolled through this forum, the sidebar and some some google-fu. Can’t seem to find anything that speaks to the mixing of these two.



I’m a recovering opiate addict with treatment resistant depression. I’ve tried Lexapro, Viibryd, Cymbalta, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Gabapentin and Remeron. So far nothing from any of those. OxyContin was a miracle drug for my depression and the reason I got hooked. I’ve stumbled on to this chemical and wonder if, because it acts on opiate receptors similarly to oxy, that it might be able to effectively treat my depression. 
















However I assume I’d have to go off the current cocktail I’m on - especially the Suboxone since it’s latched on to my receptors - in order to try it. I’m a little nervous because reviews are all over the map from miracle drug to the worst thing since crack. I’d appreciate any insights folks from this forum can provide.

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2018-12-01 19:42:42, TITLE: When does this begin to feel worthwhile?, POST BODY: Hi Guys &amp; Gals -

I know I've posted a few things like this before but I need to know when this struggle ends. It's been almost 7 months and I arguably feel more depressed today than I did in my first few weeks clean. 

I am doing all the things I'm supposed to do to try and improve my mood; twice a week therapy, 3x a week exercise, 5x a week meditation, taking 3 different psych meds and trying to be more honest and true with the people in my life. 

The thing is so far I just get more depressed each day. I read all these posts from people who are a few weeks or months into recovery and they all say it's so worth it, that they're so glad they quit and life has only gotten better. For me life seems to get worse every day I'm off oxy. 

What am I missing? What am I doing wrong? I'm so desperate to feel better I'm willing to try anything. I don't want to die - I'm so scared of it. But I think about it every single day. I've already written my note, I've already made most of the plans. I don't know what to do. I want to feel happy like all the people who post here. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for something else I can try? I'm so desperate. All ears. , PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/a29543/when_does_this_begin_to_feel_worthwhile/

I mean I'm happy for them - but I'm jealous because I just keep feeling lower and lower. 

&gt;I don’t know if I even want to live without opiates?

Exactly this. When I was using I was high functioning. Not a soul in my life knew I was high, my depression and anxiety melted away. I felt connected to the world in a way I never did before or since. I never had a problem outside of running out.

I hope I'm strong enough to keep going. I'm so tired man, I cry almost every single day. When I'm at work I often go to the bathroom just to cry for a while and then go back to work. I come home and cry alone in the bathroom for an hour or two while my wife thinks I'm showering/reading.  I need to feel even a little better soon. This is so fucking hard.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2018-12-04 18:18:53, BODY: Wow - this post really spoke to me. Everything you’ve written could be me. I found oxy because I took it as a “who cares I’m gonna kill myself anyway, why not try it?” and it literally cured me. Anxiety and depression gone! But eventually I couldn’t find pills so I had to try to get clean or switch to heroin.







I’ve been clean for 7 months and every single day is an incredible struggle. I have a medication I know cures every mental illness I have but I’m not allowed to take it. I have to suffer. So I sit and fantasize about either committing suicide or going back on drugs. If I go back on drugs my wife will leave me with the kids and I’ll want to kill myself anyway.  Feels very much like I take oxy and have no mental illness and am happy but family leaves me or stay sober and have a family but ultimately kill myself. Talk about a fucking bind.



Anyway, sorry for the wall but I feel you. I hate this shit.

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2018-12-10 18:30:33, TITLE: Why am I so resistant to AA/NA?, POST BODY: I’ve been off OxyContin for 7 months now.  I mean it’s incredibly hard and only getting harder BUT I have dutifully done everything my addiction dr and psych have asked. I won’t list them out but they are extensive.

































However, now my Psych wants me to try AA or NA. But I’ve finally hit something I won’t do - and even the thought of it makes me angry. I feel like he’s saying he can’t help me that I have to look elsewhere. I am an extreme introvert - not like the way some people say they are and just mean they’re shy - I mean I leave my house to go to work and only see people who aren’t my family or employees a couple times a year. And I’m an atheist who believes religion is toxic. So I steadfastly refuse to go to these things.
















































Why do I not want to go? I’ve been willing to try literally everything else. If these meetings are the only way I’ll eventually stay clean I think I’m fucked.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-10 19:30:32, BODY: Wow - thank you for such a thoughtful reply.  I don’t even know why the idea of having to go to one of these things makes me feel so angry. I can’t figure it out but I just know it makes me super pissed off. 




My understanding is that these meetings are supposed to make me realize my thoughts aren’t unique and others share the same struggle I do...but I know that already. I read about it here. But I just don’t care. Knowing this stuff doesn’t help me at all, it doesn’t help me with my struggle knowing other people have overcome - in fact it sometimes makes me feel worse. Because I can’t recover and others can. I’m defective. Ugh.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-24 08:06:06, BODY: Are you sure about that? Truly? Because I’m at just about 8 months and I feel like I’ve done every single thing recommended by experts and my doctors and I definitely don’t feel like it’s worth staying sober. 










To cut off all the people who will recommend the following : filling your schedule, work a lot, find a new hobby, exercise, meditate, yoga, NA, maintenance, therapy, new friends, psych meds, you can save your breath. I’ve done it all. I started opiates because my depression was so bad I was going to kill myself and figured I had absolutely nothing to lose. I tried getting clean because I couldn’t find a steady supply anymore and hoped over the course of my addiction the depression had lifted.













Spoiler alert: it didn’t. I’ve been miserable for far too long and no one would accept me back on oxy so I’m left with the only option I have left. I’ve booked the hotel, got all the pills I need and on January 9th I’m getting high one last time. 






Sorry, man. Sobriety just ain’t workable for all of us.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-24 10:32:42, BODY: You’re kind to say that. I don’t know that anyone in my life has had this kind of empathy for me and I’m crying reading your comment. I wish my family would accept it - but they simply won’t. I’ve had ongoing discussions with my wife from the time I’ve tried to quit, explained to my therapist my struggle and while they feel bad they all say the same thing; you can’t take oxy. 



So I’ve made my peace. I’ve struggled long enough for them. I feel like I’ve given it a good, honest shot with all my effort. But I can’t take oxy and keep my family and I can’t live without both of those things. So ultimately depression wins this one and I’m just going to end it so I can find a little peace for myself and give my family some closure.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-24 10:37:38, BODY: Thank you. I have been in twice a week therapy for 8 months and have told my doctor about my suicidality. Obviously he doesn’t know I’ve set a date but I decided sometime in July that if I felt no improvement by the end of December I’d set a date and just get it over with. It’s not a decision that has been impulsive or not well thought out. I have everything prepared so folks are notified the next day, proper notes have already been written etc. 


It’s all good. Setting the date was the most relief I’ve felt in years (outside of being on oxy) and while I’m sad I’m dying I look forward to being free of this pain.

You are addicted to opiates. You will steal for it, do mental gymnastics to justify using it and lots of other unsavory stuff. It is not legal, safe or prescribed. 


There is a fucking enormous difference between dependence and addiction.

SUBREDDIT: marvelstudios, TIME: 2018-12-24 23:41:39, BODY: Has anyone else noticed that in the scene where he throws spidey at Strange, the eye of agomotto gets ripped off?




Now, presumably this is when Strange replaces it with the fake and hides the time stone in the stars. But I’ve always secretly hoped he somehow tricked thanos into using a fake stone. There’s nervousness in Strange’s eyes as he floats the stone over, almost like he’s hoping he isn’t found out to be handing over a fake.



But there’s a lot to counter this - the snap works, he’s able to rewind time to kill vision and heal his chest wound. But still, I felt like seeing the eye get knocked off in this scene isn’t often pointed out.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-25 18:06:58, BODY: Hi - I’m sorry that happened to you.  I understand suicide is a painful thing to have happen but it’s difficult to explain to someone on the ground the reason a man trapped in a high rise on fire jumped. It wasn’t lack of fear of the fall, the dying or the pain. It is the choice between burning alive slowly or dying quickly. I don’t know if that makes sense.



 I guess what I mean is that my wife is tired of hearing me complain about how much I want to use. About how positive an effect it has had in my life. (No one ever knew I was on it until I got clean and confessed so I could try and stay sober) I hear it in their voices and their dismissals. I weigh on them so much. I hate that I’ve become a burden.

I promise I haven’t made the decision lightly and it’s something I’ve planned and agonized over for almost 6 months.  When I finally nailed down a date and it became real, not some idea in my head, I felt the most relief from my depression and anxiety that I’ve ever felt outside of opiates. It affirmed that what I had decided was best for me.

I feel better now that I’ve decided. Calm. Even. Able to face the day because I know soon I’ll have total relief.



So maybe closure wasn’t the right word. I’m not sure what is. I do know that living with me must be an exhausting exercise and they deserve to have better. With me out of the picture they have a shot at getting what they deserve.


Thank you for your response and empathy. I really appreciate it. You’re a kind person and I’m so sorry you lost your husband.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-28 18:20:28, BODY: You’re very correct in saying that getting through the physical pain of withdrawal is the easiest first step. It’s the mental games that you’ll be waging for and against yourself in your own mind for probably a few years at minimum that are tortuous. 


































I can’t tell you for sure if it ends. It hasn’t ended for me yet. It hasn’t even really improved at all. But I’m told that 18 months is a good point by which you should feel some change. Here’s hoping.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2018-12-28 19:04:15, BODY: Opposite for me. I loved weed before I found oxy. Then I loved them together. But now that I’m off oxy I hate the weed high. It just feels like a tease.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-28 19:48:43, BODY: It's ok I'm a pretty open book. I don't mind sharing. 

So I'm on three different psych meds currently. Remeron, Wellbutrin and Gabapentin. I have...a lot wrong with me lol. I had severe depression and anxiety and was going to kill myself and figured I'd give oxy a try. And it made me feel normal. It made all my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts went away. 

Anyway, eventually I couldn't get a steady supply so I needed to get clean because the cycle of getting a few pills, running dry and going through withdrawal, getting more pills, running dry and...well, you get the picture. I didn't quit because I wanted to. I didn't quit because it was ruining my life. My wife had no idea, my business continued to grow, we had plenty of money to cover bills etc. Opiates were nothing at all but a huge positive in my life.

So being off of them has been absolute torture for me. The remeron treats my anxiety really well but my depression and obsession with oxy are completely unbearable. I tell my psychiatrist that I'm at 8 months, shouldn't I feel even a little bit better? And he says no. Not necessarily. It could be 18 months. 24 months. They tell me 8 months is nothing. 

But I disagree. I know I'm rambling but I have tried fucking everything. I go to psych 2x a week every week, I see an addiction specialist once a month, I picked up a new hobby, I exercise, I mediate, I do yoga, I go to NA, I work 70+ hour work weeks - I don't have anything else left to try. 

I see posts on this forum about how happy people are after being off opiates for 3, 6, 9, 12 months. They talk about how worth it was and to keep going. And I'm trying...but I can't relate to these posts at all. Every day since I stopped taking oxy has been worse than the day before it. I'm miserable and a burden on my wife. She has to be sick of me whining about how I could feel better on oxy. I hope I turn a corner or something. I hope you do too, bud. 

Don't take my story to heart too much. I think you'll find some comfort in being clean because you WANT it. That's a huge difference. Your pink cloud will come. It will be worth it. Keep goin.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-29 10:14:49, BODY: I used a little over two years.  Up until the final six months my usage was extremely stable at one 30mg oxy per day.  In those final 6 months though I started using up to 150mg a day.  

How long were you using before you decided to tell your husband and try to get clean? How did he take it? Supportive, I hope...

My use literally started out as a "why not, you're going to be dead soon anyway" approach. I was shocked with how good I felt, how much better life seemed. 

I think once you've had some time for your brain to repair itself and the pleasure centers get back to homeostasis again you're going to feel like a million bucks. Rooting hard for you!

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-29 10:24:56, BODY: My gabapentin is prescribed as part of my psych treatment. I'm on 900mgs a day. I don't know if I'd need to taper off of that or if I could just stop. I don't know if going off all the meds is the answer, though, since I was put on them because of my suicidality. 

I'm no inspiration, I assure you. I'm not a happy camper or pleasant to be around. Frankly, I'm sure I'm a total drag.  But I'll go to my grave knowing I tried *everything* that was recommended to me by professionals. Beyond that there isn't really much I can do.

I really appreciate your taking the time to give me such thoughtful responses.  I’ve really run the table in terms of suggested ways of improving my disposition toward my life and recovery. 




I’ve been considering ketamine infusions because I’ve heard some really good things. But I’ve also heard some really bad things.  I may schedule an appointment for next week and if I see no improvement after that I imagine I’m throwing in the towel. Thanks again for responding and happy new year!

Yeah, that was the impetus for me to start, too. Once your habit outpaces the supply things begin spiraling so I tried to cut it off.

You want to know the really stupid thing I keep doing? I have still picked up EVERY time my dealer has had pills. I buy them all. I haven’t used since May 3 but I have bought 2-3x per month. I have almost 700 30mg oxy saved up. There’s a big part of me that just can’t wait to go back. I hate this addiction so much. It’s going to kill me one way or the other.

Ack - see, this is what it’s like living with me. Such a whiner! 



I’ve never met anyone who used poppy tea but I’ve heard it hits really hard so I can imagine the wd are torture. How long did it last? Keep going! You can be free of opiates as long as you want! :)

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-30 13:18:13, BODY: Woah - yeah, an 8-12 hour high sounds awesome. I mean, not awesome now, i guess...but I think you know what I mean!  What are you doing to cope with the 'worms' in your brain? Have you started any new hobbies or started doing exercise or anything like that? I wish I could give you some advice that would work but I haven't found 'the thing' yet for myself so I really can just repeat what others have recommended to me. 

And I guess I have willpower. Mostly I'm afraid my addiction doctor will cut me off if I piss dirty. I wish I could say I was strong or that I was strong for my wife or kids...but the truth is if I thought I could accurately predict when I was going to be tested? hahahaha...I'd be high right now. 

It seems we have very similar reasons for falling into our addictions. I wish there was some treatment that was as effective as opiates was for me. I probably never would have gotten into this mess but at this point I've tried so many different things I know that opiates are in a league of their own. 

Hope you're doing well and keeping as busy as you can. Keep in touch. I hope your pink cloud arrives sooner than later. :)

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2018-12-30 19:05:28, BODY: Excellent points. I just wanted to tack on that you should remind him how much you love him, that you’re there for him and that you want the best. Shunning/cutting off/isolating an addiction is literally one of the worst things you can do.



The drugs are filling a hole in his being that needs to be replaced with a more healthy bond. My favorite quote is that “the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. It is connection.”


Good luck.

Lists the relative strength of opioids.  It uses 10mg or oral morphine as a baseline and says 5-7.5mg of oxy is equivalent to .1-.125mg bupe. So I’m taking the equivalent of 480mg of oxy everyday? Can that possibly be right? 






My tolerance has to be absofuckinglutely jacked. Ughhhhhhhhhh. Someone please tell me I’m not gonna need 20 blues just to catch a nod when I go back?!
