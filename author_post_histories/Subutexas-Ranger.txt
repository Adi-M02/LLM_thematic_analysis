SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-23 11:00:04, BODY: 48 hours clean. On this day two weeks ago I had an accident at 4am. I was unconcious, but they found out I was high on heroin, cocain (IV both), benzos and booze. Concusion, black eye and dozens of bruises. I was admitted to a mental ward for 5 days as a „crysis intervention“. I was sleep for all 5 days and by the time I got out, I was clean. Went cold turkey without noticing. Two days later tho I was back in the hospital. My arm was infected from shooting up. The abzess was so bad, three more days and I would have lost my arm. Sadly, the emergency surgery and the drugs they gave me put me right back into withdrawal. Was on methadone for 2 days again after surgery. Got out monday, went back to the smallest possible amount of heroin for three days just to get by. Yesterday I took nothing, today same. Well...Kratom, but yeah. I feel good. Wont be dealing with withdrawal much and will cut the kratom on monday. Except for a complete loss of energy, I feel good. 

I got clean before. But this time is different.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-25 14:57:44, BODY: Just hit 100 hours since my last heroin use. But I already had 5 days clean two weeks ago and 3 or 4 the week after, so I was already halfway clean. I’m using Kratom, but I could go without. I use it for energy tho. What can I say...I’m feeling ok I guess. I mean, I have zero energy and I‘m pretty depressed. But after 6 months of using heroin and cocaine IV daily, I really can’t complain. Made it out rather easy thanks to an accident that left me almost unconscious for a week two weeks ago, so I detoxed while sleeping 22 hours a day. Will force myself to exercise starting tomorrow so my back will eventually stop hurting.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-25 14:59:48, BODY: Good job. How’s your energy? I find the lack of energy to be the most annoying part at the late acute stage.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-26 04:14:51, BODY: I know that feel. When I got out of the hospital two weeks ago, I was 6 days clean and happy about it. Then I found a gram at my place I had forgotten about. I managed to flush almost all of it. But I did do one small hit, and acute withdrawals were back the next day. Just remember how much it sucked to be dependent on that devil. Toss it. Flush it. Just be done with it. And yes, you MUST tell your GF about this. That’s the only way to make sure you wont slip if it arrives.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-29 12:27:54, BODY: After I slipped on monday after 5 days clean, I am again at 72+ hours. Had I known how much it restart withdrawals, I would not have used monday. But anyway...still making progress. I really hope that it wont be long until my energy comes back. Really, the tiredness, heavy limbs and the inability to find joy in anything makes it really hard.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-29 12:30:41, BODY: Taking half days off does nothing. If you can go over 24 hours without getting sick, you’re probably in the clear tho. But in the ling run, you can’t win. Just be aware.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-30 06:28:58, BODY: Congratz. I was stupid enough to use again, just one hit, once I hit 5 days. That was monday and I still don’t feel right. So don’t be stupid. Don’t use again. You’ll be right back at day one.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-31 13:54:31, BODY: Subs work great the first time you use them. Expect this time to be much more uncomfortable than last time you detoxed. Also, be very careful when you start going on subs. Don’t risk PWD. Other than that...I am going to say what people said to me when I was exactly where you are now, exactly one year ago. Quit now and never look back. You can still get out without much damage. If you relapse again, you WILL fuck your life up, trust me. 

Last year, I was also only snorting H for a few month. I quit with subs and since that was so easy, I lost all respect for that drug. Now, one year later, I am 20k in debt, I have no useable veins left in my arms or legs, I just had surgery on my left arm. The infection I had from shooting up with dirty gear was so bad, I almost lost my arm. I did lose m job, all my money, and I am currently packing for a mandatory 3-6 month stay at a rehab/therapy facility. It was either that or jail.

Quit now. It gets worse with every time you relapse. You havnt destroyed your life yet. Your next stint on heroin WILL end your life as you know it.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-31 14:00:56, BODY: Dont undetestimate PAWS. Making it through acute withdrawals seems like the hardest part. But actually, the weeks that follow really get you. You need to keep yourself busy. It’s so cliche, but working out is your best weapon to get through PAWS.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-31 14:04:40, BODY: Good. Make sure to remember that. Have you told people, like friends or family? You should. When people know, it will make it harder for you to relapse, because now they will notice. It is important that you build some sort if safety net, because you can’t trust yozrself.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-10-31 15:19:56, BODY: I also used Kratom like a step between heroin and nothing. Never felt great on Kratom, but it made the first two weeks bareable. Than I just quit kratom CT. Felt some WD for 2 days and that was it. 

I am concidering mushrooms. This whole „rewireing the brain“ thing...i think there might be sonething to it. And I enjoyed doing shrooms by mSelf at home in the past.

TITLE: Will my veins heal or are they done forever, POST BODY: So, here’s my problem: All the veins in my arms have become unuseable. I only IV‘d for like six month, but in those months I shot up up to 15 times a day with terrible technique, dull needles and always the same spot. The veins are now rather hard and not as squishy as they should feel, the whole area around the veins is darkened and in some spots, I have big scars running along the vein. And of course, they don’t work anymore. My question is: will they heal after time or are they done forever? Currently, doctors cant even draw blood from anywhere but my neck, so that sucks. I am clean now and would like to know if that damage is permanent. My big bicep vein for example is still hard as a bass guitar string, and it‘s been two month since I last injected there.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formula1, TIME: 2020-12-01 05:56:11, BODY: Thank you Sir. Hating a driver makes the season much more interesting. Man, I can’t wait for next year. So much will happen. We will witness Lewis set a a bunch of records that may never be broken. Most importantly, his 8th title. But I’m most excited about the midfield. That’s gonna be a wild ride. Lando and Ric as team mates...the thought of that alone makes me giggle like a stoned 7th grader. They will be pure entertainment...and probably fast! McLaren did well this year and those two drivers deliver. And Vettel in a new car...just wow. Anxious to see how this will play out. Looking at the performance of the boys in pink right now, everything is possible. But how will he stack up against Lance, who we all like now because Nikita is the new him? And than there will be a Schumacher on the track again. How awesome is that? And he is paired with the most hateable millionaires-son Russia could produce. I just know that Mazepin will produce a full blown scandal by saying something despicable and stupid in connection with the #weraceasone initiative before the season has even started. He will go full Russian. And who will drive next to Max? And will this driver be a match for the mad dutch? And...and...and...Ferrari! What will happen there? Top Team again or even deeper in doodoo. Man, theres soooo much going on. I fuckin love F1.

SUBREDDIT: formuladank, TIME: 2020-12-05 14:48:18, BODY: That is sooooo exactly how I feel about this situation. Pressure on Bottas is immense. But on the other hand, I like George and I feel like we are going to look back at this race being the day where he secured his drive at Mercedes once the champ is gone, and becoming the champ himself. He’s so young and already sitting in the winning car. He could break a lot of records.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-08 05:03:10, BODY: On the height of my addiction, I broke off all contact to my entire family after a fight I instigated so I could leave rehab and continue to kill myself without the hastel of coming up with new lies every day. And it worked. Without having to explain myself to anybody I managed to lose 20 lbs in 4 weeks and it all ended in the ICU. 

When addiction takes over, literally everything an addict does is to feed his addiction. He broke up with you because you were in the way of him getting high 24/7. And seeking treatment was the easiest and non-debatable excuse he could come up with. 

Off course, that’s just a theory. But that’s how I did it.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-08 13:27:01, BODY: Exactly how I did it a few times. On day three aswell. The key is to take just enough to end the symptoms.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-08 13:36:11, BODY: The problem is that fent is very short acting. That makes tapering it very hard. Same with heroin. I tapered down from shooting half a gram 3-4 times per day to snorting 200mg once a day. But stopping completely was still as painful as ever and actually impossible. But switching to a small amount of 2mg of subutex and tapering off from there within 6 days was easy. Maybe try that.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-08 13:39:04, BODY: I started with 2mg subutex on day 1, about 20 hours after my last heroin dose. And than I just took smaller and smaller pieces of subutex everyday until it was gone.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-13 05:10:09, BODY: Well, the good news it’s been only three months. But never the less, going cold turkey will be extremely harsh. The way I used to handle this, was get my hand on a few subs and taper off. It worked great for me. Sorry, but that’s the best advise I can come up with.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-13 12:46:55, BODY: Definitely not too long to make it on your own. It never is. It‘s not like they have any magic tricks in their clinics. As long as you can get your hands on subs and you have someone at home to keep an eye on you, do it at home, where you’re comfortable. Last time I detoxed I was in a similar spot. I waited until I was in medium withdrawals, about 19 hours after my last heroin dose, and took 4 mg subutex. I snorted it though. 10 minutes later I was perfectly fine and even 24 hours later I was still ok. I think on day 2 I railed 3 mg and after that, I reduced by 0.5 mg per day until it was gone. I didn’t feel great for a few days after that. A little bit depressed, some stomach and digestion issues, hard time sleeping...but totally bearable and nothing compared to real withdrawals. It was actually too easy, because it made me lose all fear I had off becoming dependent. That set me up for a series of damaging relapses. But we all know that story. 

Good luck getting clean bud. Stick to it NOW and by the time you’re sitting under the Christmas tree with your loved ones, it will all be over and you’re back in the saddle.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formula1, TIME: 2020-12-13 17:19:34, BODY: This year was the most emotional year ever. The drivers are expressing their feelings left and right and it’s absolutely beautiful. The question on my mind is, is this year different or is it just that we never got to see this side of the sport before? Social media and Liberty changed F1 for the better. Drivers changed from being emotionless machines with no personality, who only gave standardized answers to all questions to...to what we saw this year: humans. They are goofy, they show emotions, they value their friendship and openly show their respect for one another...and man, I love this. I always loved the sport. But now I love these drivers not only for their talent, but much more for their personality. And following F1 was never this fun. Am I a bit tipsy? Yes, but still...I love F1.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-13 19:15:21, BODY: Tapering off of short acting opis does not work. You can work your dependence down to a very low level, but not low enough to finally jump off comfortably. At least in my experience. Switching to long acting opis, like sub or methadone, works a hundred times better. If you cant get your hands on those, I would go the kratom way. Technically kratom is short acting too, but quitting kratom is still rather easy compared to fent, heroin or oxy. So it is a good idea to switch to kratom, which will only work if your fent/heroin habbit is rather low, and than taper Kratom down to zero.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-13 19:22:17, BODY: Another option is Lyrica (pregabalin). That stuff is not an opi, but works wonders in suppressing opi withdrawal symptoms. At least for some people. Idealy, you take lyrica every 8-12 hours for 4-5 days and thats it. After 4-5 days you are through the acute phase of opiate withdrawal and havnt yet become dependent on pregabalin. 

In my experience it works. But like many people, I don’t like being on lyrica. I can do it for a day, but not for long enough to make it through heroin withdrawals. I’d detox using subutex always. Works for me.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formuladank, TIME: 2020-12-13 19:38:40, BODY: Well, for me it was one of the best seasons in the 30 years I am following this sport. And a boring finale wont change that. Kinda anticlimactic to end this banger of a season with such a dull race, but it only makes me more excited for 2021. And I am still hoping something awesome will happen on the driver market.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formuladank, TIME: 2020-12-13 21:23:54, BODY: Well, I actually said „one of the best“, so I definitely do not exclude those seasons, but this year was special in a different way. The fight for first was not close at all, but the midfield was crazy, with all those unexpected and first time podiums. And going back to so many classic race tracks. It was special. Maybe it’s because of corona, maybe it’s because the social media generation took over the paddock, but I feel more personally connected to the drivers and the sport than ever before. This year F1 became personal for me. It was my no. 1 thing to get my mind off all the bad things we lived through. I will forever remember the pandemic as the year I spent at home in my pajamas and following F1 on every channel I could.

Keep doing what you are doing for another 2 days and you should be through the acute phase of withdrawals. Just don’t take the Lyrica for more than 5 days, 7 max so you don’t get hooked.

The Hydro withdrawals are mostly over after 5 days, so you wont go into WD when you kick Lyrica by then. Theres no need for the Gabapentin and especially no need for Kratom. You are clean now, dont start doing stuff you will get hooked on again.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-15 08:30:09, BODY: I recently kicked with 1 8mg subutex. I just works. The only problem is, I started to enjoy the subutex high a bit too much. When I was clean, I was craving sub more than H.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-15 16:58:43, BODY: No. 24 hours maximum if fentanyl was the drug of choice. 72 hours goes for long acting opis, like methadone.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-15 17:03:32, BODY: Wait 24 hours after your last dose, or until you are in moderate withdrawal. Start with half a strip and see how you feel after 60 minutes. If you feel good, good. If not, take another 1/4 strip. Once you are feeling ok, you found your dose. Now reduce that dose by a bit daily. If you want to do a quick taper (good idea since you were only on it 3 month) aim for 5-7 days. One strip total could totally be enough. So, just take smaller and smaller pieces every 24 hours until you quit completely. You may feel some mild withdrawals towards the end, but they will be bareable.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-16 04:50:57, BODY: The sub should eleminate to symptoms once you found your dose and only reappear minimally as you taper down and finally kick em. If everything goes well, you will get through it with minimal symptoms. But do not underestimate the post acute phase.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-16 04:56:04, BODY: That‘s very weird, because that is the standard advise. It‘s even what the subutex manufacturing company says. You need to make sure there’s no active opioid/opiate on your receptors. Fast acting ones like heroin, oxy or fent are 100% gone after 24 hours, long acting ones, especially methadone take 3 days. That’s why switching from methadone to sub is so complicated for people in a substitution program. Tho there is a new method to do the switch that works for most. Forgot the name. 

Anyway, I quit heroin using sub multiple times using the method I described. I usually started sub after 16-18 hours, because I was already in full WD. Worked like a charm every time.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-16 05:11:09, BODY: I know what you mean. The part some people would think is the worst about this lifestyle, is what I like most. Hanging around in the worst neighborhood, being friends with homeless people and fist bumping with die hard criminals. I always prefered shooting up in the consumption room or even on the streets to doing it at home. I somehow feel like I‘m having an experience most people wont ever have and therefore this is awesome. Like travelling to a very remote destination, off the beaten pass. I mean, one day when all this is over, I wont regret having made this crazy experience. I think.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-16 06:49:09, BODY: You got this. Just remember to take as little sub as neccesary. Half a strip on induction will more than likely be enough. And as I mentioned before, be aware of the post acute phase. When physical symptoms are no more, the mind fuckery starts. That’s where everyone relapses. Just remember how badly you wanted to get clean.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-16 14:51:55, BODY: Yes, I think thats correct. At least thats what they call it in the US. In Germany its referred to as the „Ravensburger Methode“. Works for some people, but not everybody. But worth it. I couldn’t imagine living my life on methadone. Stuff makes you so tired and slow. Subutex makes me feel so freakishly clear and sober. If everything fails, taking sub for the rest of my life is an acceptable option.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-16 15:30:40, BODY: To be honest, I dont know much about fent. It never arrived here in Germany, so we are blessed in that way. But I do know that fent is one of the fastest opi there is, so it should be out of your system in 24 hours. I guess the reasoning is, the stuff you guys get in the US, no matter if it’s supposed to be heroin or whatever pills, is never what they say it is. And therefore you should wait 72 hours in any case, to be safe. And that makes sense.

Lately, there was barely a day without any form of F1 related news, a tweet or simply a picture, that in some way made my day. I’ve been an F1 fan since the late 80s, but I never felt so connected with this sport like this year. 2020 was wild. The season sure was a great one. But there is something about the drivers this year, all of them, as well as a bunch of other well known figures from the paddock, that feels really special. Maybe it’s because social media creates the illusion of knowing the drivers personally and being part of their inner circle. Or maybe it’s because modern day drivers are not the soulless driving machines they used to be portrait as, but normal people who show emotions, make jokes and don’t take themselves so seriously. Probably a mix of both. But man...being an F1 fan was never more rewarding. Can’t wait for 2021. Oh, and fuck you, Nikita.

My problem with Hülk is, while he was always a top performer bringing solid results, it never felt like he was really „hungry“ for that podium. It felt like he didn’t want it enough. Solid results were good enough for him, he never aimed for sensational results.

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-20 06:24:56, BODY: If you want us to help you, please help us, by speaking in actual sentences. Those dots and commas exist for a reason. 

20mg or less a day really isn’t much. Do you have severe withdrawal symptoms? I would probably try to detox with OTC medication. Some loperamide for the diarrhea, some ibuprofen for the joint and muscle pain, tea for your stomach and valerian root for your nerves. You can also try megadosing vitamin c. Google is your friend here. 

I would refrain from using subutex/suboxone, benzos or even kratom. Those have potential to create an even bigger problem and your habit is too small to risk it. 

Tapering as low as possible before jumping off is always a good idea. But tapering below a certain point becomes very hard with short acting opioids like oxy. But it‘s always worth a try. The smaller your habit before you jump, the milder the withdrawals gonna be. 

Good luck. Be strong now and it will be all over before the new year begins.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-20 06:37:35, BODY: The point most people are missing, is that it depends on the opis in your system. Fent is fast acting. So it will be out of your system after 24 hours (even less) and you can start subs. Same witn oxy and heroin. Methadone on the other hand is in your system waaaay longer. Here you need to wait 72 hours, until no methadone is still active on your receptors. 
I usually start sub around 16 hours after heroin. Never ran into trouble.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-20 06:42:25, BODY: If fent was your drug of choice, you can start sub much earlier without any risk. Sub, like heroin and oxy, is a fast acting opi and will 100% be gone from your receptors after 24 hours. The whole 72 hour rule pretty much only applys to slow acting opis, mainly methadone. You need to watch out with the kratom though. Technically, using sub too early after kratom can cause PWD. 

My personal advise would be, if the kratom works, stick to it and dont use sub at all. You can taper off kratom quite comfortably over a week or two. Good luck.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-20 06:47:36, BODY: 72 hours is only necessary for long acting opioids, mainly methadone. If the drug OP consumed really was fent only, or fent and oxy, 24 hours will be long enough. This is how it is handled in detox clinics. 24 hours for heroin/fent/oxy users, 72 hours for people on methadone who wish to switch to bupe. Though these days, there is a better method to do the switch. I forgot what the english name is. „Ravensburger Methode“ in german.

Then, when he realized that people weren’t buying it and that he was in serious trouble, he lawyered up. And the first thing his lawyer told him was to delete the apology, because that could be used against him in court.

SUBREDDIT: meth, TIME: 2020-12-27 13:02:44, # COMMENTS: 16, SCORE: 12
TITLE: First time meth and I was soooo chill. Is that normal?, POST BODY: So, here goes: I shot up meth for the first time yesterday (150mg I think). Even though it was my first time meth, I am a very experienced drug user. I used to shoot loads of coke, which I thought would be similar to shooting meth: An intense rush followed by hours of hyperactivity and restlessness that is kinda uncomfortable. That’s why I quit shooting coke. It’s really only the rush which lasts minutes that is good. 
But while the rush from the meth was definitely very intense, actually so intense it made my knees weak and I had to sit down. I was pretty chillax and comfy all the time. In fact, right after pulling the needle out, I just laid down on my bed and listened to music for over an hour, feeling amazing all the time, but without feeling so „wired“ or hyperactive. 
Is that normal? I expected to be jumping up and down for hours and coming down really bad.
After 3 hours or so I was definitely feeling a comedown, but a few beers and 1mg knolopin took care of that., PERMALINK: /r/meth/comments/kl97hk/first_time_meth_and_i_was_soooo_chill_is_that/

Or maybe this is how I die. Time will tell. All I can say is, chilling at home on meth was a great saturday.

SUBREDDIT: meth, TIME: 2020-12-27 16:25:45, BODY: Question: Is it ok to use a Benzo, like knolopin, for the comedown? And what are the safer-use rules here? I used Clonazepam 3 hours after my last hit. Is that an acceptable way to handle comedowns? I guess next time I will use a little more meth and probably keep hitting a few times before calling it a day. So the comedown will be worse and I want to be prepared...

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-30 18:12:44, BODY: Tapering off on heroin is extremely hard. No matter how low you will be able to go, the final kick will be extremely harsh. Why not use sub? You dont have to be on it for a long time. Even a 7 day taper can make the kick 90% easier.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2020-12-30 18:35:15, BODY: The only way it can make you sicker is if you take it too soon after your last heroin dose. I shot up to 2g a day and came off with subutex rather comfortably many times. Though I would get the pill kind, crush it and snort it. The faster onset and the fact that you’re snorting it helps alot with the mind game when getting off the fun opiates.

They were a fun fan project. But now as they got as big as they are, what they are doing doesn’t work anymore. They aren’t journalists. And they are not F1 experts. Not at all.

TITLE: Took Methadone while on sub. Take sub as usual or wait?, POST BODY: Yeah so I am detoxing from H. Did 6 mg Subutex and felt absolutely great 30 hours in. Than my sleepy brain took 40 mg methadone out of forgetfulness. Felt nothing. Do I have to wait 48 hours before continuing sub now, or can I keep taking sub as usual. I mean, the sub should have eliminated most of the methadone anyway, right? I was thinking about taking sub again 24 hours after the methadone blunder, in order to avoid a sleepless night.

TITLE: Books to read in rehab, POST BODY: Next month I’m turning the page on my life as a junky. After having completely detoxed of absolutely every substance (work in progress), I will move into a specialized rehab clinic, where I will live for 26 weeks, or six months. Yes, it‘s gonna be boring. Besides the wide variety of therapy sessions I will have to attend daily, the only things I can do in my free time are ping pong and reading. Can anyone suggest a good book a young-ish man like me and in my situation should read? All suggestions welcome.


UPDATE: I just remembered I have in my possession a very, very, VERY awesome book to read there: Calvin &amp; Hobbes, the complete collection. I love Calvin &amp; Hobbes so much. It makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me reevaluate everything. And all that while giving me a warm, fuzzy feeling in my tummy, like I‘m six years old and Grandma made crepes! I discovered C&amp;H when I was 13. and it had a huge impact on my intellectual development. When I was in the process of becoming a grown-up, Bill Watterson was my spiritual leader...kinda. Last time I read the complete collection was in 2006. Since then, I forbid myself to read any C&amp;H comic until I have waited long enough and forgot enough that I can reread....nah, re-live it all again. I guess this is the perfect occasion., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/lwj4z7/books_to_read_in_rehab/

SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2021-03-03 06:23:29, BODY: Thanks. Feeling very optimistic. Spending six month away from everything, where there is zero chance of spontaneously relapsing is just brilliant. From the clinic to the next plug is a three hour journey, if you catch all your trains and busses that is. Perfect. Since I started drinking on weekends when I was eleven, I never had six months sober. I don’t even think all these therapy sessions there will do much. It’s just about having that one big break in my life where I can reevaluate everything and be sober for a really long time. PAWS will be at maximum when I’m there. But PAWS is so much easier to handle away from home. I will learn how to entertain myself sober. I will finally start doing that exercise routine for my bad back...and stick to it long enough to actually lessen my back pain. I will watch my bank account crawl out of debt, month after month. I am forty. Right in the middle. I get the chance to pause my life and think really long about how I want to do the second half. I did the first half on full self destruction mode. Ain’t gonna lie, had fun. But it ran dry, time for something new. 

And in case you are wondering how I finance that: Communi... I mean German healthcare system. When my drug problem became so bad I couldn’t function anymore, I wasn’t fired. I got a sick note from the doctor. Because addiction is an illness. And until I had therapy, I am too sick to work. The law forbids my employer to fire me. I received full salary for the first six weeks. After that, the insurance pays my monthly salary. About 80% from what my normal salary was. And they will keep paying it until my therapy is completed and I’m back at my job. Pretty exactly one year after I woke up in the ICU. Universal healthcare is a beast.

SUBREDDIT: formuladank, TIME: 2021-03-10 10:06:17, BODY: She is a super model and was an official guest for the race and was given the honor of waving the checkered flag. And whoever gave her the signal to do so did it a lap early. There were no overtakes in the last lap, so it gad no effect on the result. But Ric drove the fastest lap of the race in the last lap. There were no points for fastest lap back than, but it still sucked for him. But the real shame was the reaction on social media. Because it happened to a woman who had the audacity to be pretty, the reaction from the incel, virgin and sexually frustrated community was harsh.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formuladank, TIME: 2021-03-10 10:52:22, BODY: Well, I am talking about the reaction within minutes of the event. The things I read on twitter and in numerous facebook/reddit/twitch threads while the events unfolded were so terrible that I turned my TV and all internet devices off for the rest of the day. I guess most of those comments that can only be defined as hate-speech were soon gone tho, with the poster banned for life. But maybe you’re right and the overall reaction wasn’t so bad, I just happened to lurk in the wrong thread at the wrong time.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2021-03-31 12:52:56, BODY: I disagree. Diacetylmorphine therapy is not the solution that fits everyone and will end to the problem. Diamorphine therapy is only an option for the absolute hardcore addicts, for whom everything else failed. For the majority of addicts, sub and methadone are much, much better. 

The problem which makes it so bad in the US compared to other countrys, is simply your war on drugs. That’s what fueles the pandemic and makes things like fentanyl happen. In other countrys, addiction is treated like an illness and addicts are not seen as criminals. That changes a lot. Including the trafficking.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2021-03-31 13:00:25, BODY: Well, I personally believe in the switchback method, but it’s a slippery slope. What about Kratom? Kratom can be tapered pretty well, and in my experience, quitting Kratom CT is doable. Switch to Kratom, taper down and after four weeks, just quit. For the worst days, switch between Benzos and Pregabalin. Both work great and by switching, theres less chance of getting hooked.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2021-03-31 13:08:36, BODY: Pregabalin is better known as Lyrica. Similar to Gabapentine, but better imo. It’s really good at surpressing withdrawal symptoms. A lot of people succeeded at quitting heroin simply by using Pregabalin for five days straight and nothing else. If it works for you, it’s awesome, because since it’s not an opiate, it’s like you’re quitting CT and you’re on the other side after five days.

TITLE: How fast does your tolerance drop?, POST BODY: Pretty straight forward question. Once you made it to having consecutive completely drug free days on your road to recovery, either after going CT, or after the last day of a sub detox taper plan; how much does your tolerance drop now with each day/ after one week/after a month?

I hope that I wont ever need this information, but I think I should know this in case of a relapse, so that a relapse remains a slip up, not a tragedy.

I support the BLM movement and the whole kneeling thing, but it felt  out of place in F1, with this whole thing kinda being an American thing on one hand, and F1 having an international audience (that is actually kinda lacking in the US) on the other. I'm all for doing a statement against racism (and lots of other \*isms), but they could have found a different way, maybe their own way to express it. Or better, they should do that now. It felt a little bit like jumping on a bandwagon back then when they started to kneel. If I remember right, Lewis pushed that back then. And I fully get why he felt the urge to do that. He is a black athlete and there is this huge thing happening right now around black athletes˛ but he is in F1, in Europe and really really far away from "the action" and he wants to get involved.  But while everybody talks about this, much bigger things happened. They drove pride-flags around Russia and Arabic countries. That's a way bigger deal than kneeling.

Mostly homeless people roam the streets all day for those and can make a living, or feed their addiction, from it. It’s even common courtesy to not throw those cans or bottles in trashcans but put them next to it, so those people don’t have to dig through the trash.

Race cars shouldn't look clean and polished. They need to look a bit wild and thrown together at the last minute with sponsors whose colors don't match and so on. This years grid will look quite different and I like it.

And the fact that he would build the car in the US makes it even better. F1 just gets bigger and after over half a century of trying, it finally arrived in the US. Plus seeing the name Andretti on a regular again makes my heart explode. One of the biggest families in motorsports.

TITLE: Relapsed on Heroin while on Sub...what now?, POST BODY: So pretty much the title. I induced Subutex this morning with 4mg and relapsed on heroin (definitely no fent) an hour later. The heroin effects are very weak. I guess the Bupe pretty much kicks the heroin off my receptors, right? When will I be ok to take subutex again? I usually wait 16 hours after heroin and never had a problem. Right now I am wondering if I am even on heroin or if the bupe cancelled it out pretty much right away. Thanks for your input., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/sx2s8q/relapsed_on_heroin_while_on_subwhat_now/

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-20 09:45:09, BODY: Yeah I know better than to do it the other way around. Right now Im just mad at myself for having failed day 1 of going on sub. But than again, the heroin has very little effect anyway and by now theres probably only sub on my receptors. So I will take sub tomorrow morning as if nothing happened. Sub always works great for a quick detox for me, almost painless, but the first day always blows.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formuladank, TIME: 2022-02-22 20:34:07, BODY: Crazy to see how exposed the drivers used to be. Really feels like a miracle there were no deaths for so long until Ratzenbergers and Sennas deaths.

TITLE: Using Lyrica for WD — what's the best way to split a capsule?, POST BODY: I know this is kinda the wrong place, but I don't know where else to ask this. And it is in the context of a heroin detox, so...
 
\+++UPDATE+++

It's now over 18 hours since I took heroin and 15 hours since I took 200mg Lyrica.And I have zero withdrawal symptoms. I am absolutely smashed, I slept like a stone for 10 hours and my eyes keep falling shut since I am "up". Just smoked a cigarette and my knees got weak. Feeling kinda drunk, but most importantly: absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. I am gonna wait as long as possible before taking subs. This is definitely an awesome helper for the first day of sub, where the waiting time can always suck and even after you dose, still feel bad because sub lacks a sedating component. Just don't take too much Lyrica! I took 200mg and wish I took 150mg.

\+++UPDATE OVER+++

&amp;#x200B;

Doing the switch from Heroin to Subutex tomorrow in order to do a quick taper. I've done this many times, so I don't need any advice about that. But I decided to take some Pregabalin/Lyrica in between to ease the waiting time before I can safely take sub. Lyrica has worked wonders for me in the past for heroin, so I want to see how long I can stretch out the waiting time without suffering. In other attempts, Lyrica would erase 100% of the symptoms. But that was back when I was rather new to this and "only snorted" about half a G per day. Today I'm an IV user, been on it for 4 months now (was clean 6 for 6 months last year) and consume anywhere from 0.5 to 2g per day. So I don't know if Lyrica will be just as effective this time. Anyway...

...the problem: It's a 300mg capsule and I want to do half now, other half another time. What's the smart way to do this? Sure, I can open and re-close the capsule to make a 150mg one˛; but what is the best way to consume the loose powder? Should I just put it on a spoon and chase it down with some water? Put it in cigarette-paper and swallow a little bag? Any advice is welcome.

And for those who care about my detox-routine:Last heroin dose at 6 PM. 150mg Pregabalin around 9 PM (to ensure a sound sleep w/o being woken up by withdrawal symptoms in the wee hours) and at 10 AM the next morning, I am clear to go on sub (16 hours never failed me, 100% no fent). Though I wanna see how well the Lyrica works and if I can wait longer, ideally till 6 PM. And after that it goes...Day 0: 1g Heroin, 150mg LyricaDay 1: 6mg SubDay 2: 4 mg SubDay 3: 4 mg SubDay 4: 2 mg SubDay 5: \*\*\~\*\*1.3 mg SubDay 6: \*\*\~\*\*0.7 mg SubDay 7-10: No more Opiates, but I may take 150mg Lyrica if needed in those days., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/szohg5/using_lyrica_for_wd_whats_the_best_way_to_split_a/

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-23 13:20:53, BODY: Good luck. Like I said, Lyrica eleminated 100% of my WDs last time. I am actually concidering to try to kick simply by being on Lyrica for five days

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-23 15:33:16, BODY: Same place where I get my smack. My local drug-scene. It’s a semi-open drug-market by the central train-station here. Just like in every bigger German city. Lyrica really goes hand in hand with heroin here nowadays. Lots if not most heroin addicts around here are addicted to Lyrica as well. Apparently it’s pretty easy to get a prescription for them, even…or maybe especially as a heroin addict. So whereever you find heroin, you’ll get offered Lyrica too, usually sold for 1€ per 300mg capsule. 

So to make a long story short: No, I can’t hook you up.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-23 17:01:24, BODY: Fent is a non issue in Germany. Zero known cases of heroin laced with fent. My experience with Lyrica isn’t uncommon. In fact, studys have been conducted.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-26 03:34:37, BODY: I think the heroin supply is just too good. There’s no reason for fent to take over. People bring it in directly from Afghanistan

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: formula1, TIME: 2022-02-26 14:33:27, BODY: Very sad. Robert is a great driver who, unlike Nikita, could end up a victim to this situation. Nikita is not only a pay driver, he’s a Russian nationalist. He made quite a few comments in that direction in the past.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-26 15:41:49, BODY: Yeah, I guess that's a definitive upside from having refugees coming into the country everyday. Or having a whole community of Afghans and Iranians living here and going back and forth from there to here. I never had a bag that was significantly stronger than any other in my 3 years of buying from dozens of different dealers. I get heroin of all different shades of brown. Sometimes it's sand, sometimes a rock, but it's always around 10-15% pure. The whole fent thing makes it as dangerous as heroin used to be back in the 80s and 90s, where you never knew how strong your dope was. Those days are over for heroin.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: OpiatesRecovery, TIME: 2022-02-28 06:58:30, BODY: Been there a million times. With heroin though, but same situation. Drinks tons of water before you get tested. Start at least 6 hours ahead of the test and drink a liter per hour. You may also want to take some vitamin b to make sure your urine is yellow. Some places will reject a sample thats too clear. You may also take some creatine, to make sure creatinine levels aren’t too low, another reason to reject a sample. Good luck.
