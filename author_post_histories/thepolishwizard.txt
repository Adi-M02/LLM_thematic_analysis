I am so sorry for your pain, thankfully I've never had to deal with that type of pain, I almost put my family through it though myself when i OD'd and was on dialysis in a hospital for a month, and to see the pain in my families faces was terrible, I'm lucky to be alive, and so are you. I can't speak from experience but I have to imagine it will get easier, it's still fresh for you. You don't have to forget him to move on, just take him with you in everything you do, I am sure he would want you to try to move forward and be happy.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-01-16 16:24:18, BODY: OP your situation really made me feel empathy for you. It sounds like your really confused and having to deal with a lot of shit that you don't deserve. You mentioned your on the Xanax for anxiety that stems from abuse you suffered as a child? have you tried to work through those issues with a therapist before? you mentioned your in therapy, and if your working on moving past those issues i am sure that will help with the anxiety. i agree with the others that have reccomended a longer acting benzo for the anxiety, something like klonpin would be good. It would be best for you to sit down with a doctor and be honest about what your thinking, maybe write down what your goals are and a timeline that your thinking about for achieving those goals (dont be to hard on yourself with the amount of time this will take). make a comprehensive plan and figure out how your going to attack this beast and try like hell to stick to it, but dont be discouraged if you slip, we all do. I cannot imagine the mental, emotional and physical pain your dealing with, your so young, from your post i gather that your strong kid, and you can do this. you are welcome to PM me if you need someone to talk to (i don't have much experience with detoxing i have only done it a few times) but i am willing to talk and listen, as i am sure that will help. good luck man, keep us updated on how it is working out and know you have a community thats got your back!

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-01-28 17:29:31, BODY: What type of injury causes your pain? If that question is out of line lemme know, reading this sub I'm always curious about how people with actual pain deal with it, it must be tough to always be hurting to the point where you need all of those pills, I can imagine your probably suffering. I've had a few surgeries but never any lasting pain and I hope I never have to deal with it, I'm sure the opiate buzz is nice but if it's numbing your pain do you still enjoy it as much?

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-01-28 18:42:49, BODY: Thanks for the detailed answer. I've never done heroin before, I've never even seen it. I drink opium tea (poppy seeds / poppy pods that I grow myself) and I've taken pills a few times. What's the difference in the numbering of heroin, ie #3 vs #4? I've visited Edinburgh before and it was a pretty cool town, we drove to the islands in the north of Scotland and took a ferry (I think it was Shetland if I recall right, I was a youngster) and it was really beautiful, and remote, it seemed like the landscape went on forever and there is little trees and such. I've seen the documentary on the addict Ben (I think he was in Brighton down in England) and that gave me a rough idea of what addicts in the UK deal with, it was interesting and really sad, and of course I've seen trains pitting That's great that healthcare is free, I hope they can implement something like that here in the US but for some reason it seems to be impossible. What is the stigma like in Scotland? In the US it's losing some of its stigma the more widespread the problem of abuse becomes, which is good that it's not looked down on as much (still people judge those damn junkies) your dope seems pretty cheap, is it cheaper in England? And do you know where the dope comes from? Here in the US the Mexican drug cartels smuggle most of it in, I can imagine that it's tougher in the UK to get large shipments

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-01-31 01:43:10, BODY: i really hate reading these posts, its so heartbreaking. i can imagine what your going through right now. ive luckily never been through anything like what your dealing with. i stopped my daily use about two months ago and ive been attempting to "chip" but this past week i used everyday, thankfully its not heroin, and i tell myself id never try heroin but im sure if i stick around long enough ill end up losing everything, so i am going to finally try and put it down for good starting tomorrow. ive really been thinking alot this weekend about all the money ive wasted, the possible damage ive done to myself and how much my family would be disapointed and upset if they learned of the path i was on. i would put it down for a week or two and than id convince myself it was okay, "just one more time" as you said, and that was many times ago. this post really hit home for me because i am still at that stage where i can put it down and walk away from it with little damage done, sure im a shit ton of debt but i can still pay my bills and actually live somewhat comfortably. i am going to try and stop with this shit now, reaidng your post i know that could be me in the fhthre, so thats it, im out, i just sat at my desk for about 20 mins tryg to justify to keep using, but i cant anymore, so thanks for sparking that in me. 

As for some words of encouragement, you stated youve got your bf with you and your in it together. so at least your not alone, although this might make it even harder to quit, its tough for somoeone to get clean by themselves but add another addict to the mix and it makes that much harder. keep your head up though. try and make this the lowest you fall. please dont say "fuck it", please try and put up a fight to this. you already know what to do and how to do it, you have done it once and you can do it again. try and get some sleep tonight and wake up tommorow and figure out what you need to do. find yourself somewhere to stay and get sober. i dont know from personal experience but id guess that there is little chance of putting the pieces back together if your still getting high, and im sure the process will hurt that much more sober, but it seems like you gotta make a choice right now, its gonna come down to you, your child or the drug. the drug wins too many times, make sure it doesnt beat you. 

keep your head up and know through your post i have made the final decision to try and put this shit down for myself, you helped me out tonight, please help yourself

tl:dr - this post prompted me stop making excuses for myself and finally put real effort into staying sober and moving on with my life.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-03-02 23:26:13, BODY: sure man, np. i know it ain't easy but just take a step back and relax. i did some stupid shit during the worst time in my addiction that i thought would affect me for the rest of my life. and saying your addiction made those decisions and not you is the truth. i would never steal now that i am sober(ish). addiction takes you to some dark places man. as for the job thing, unless they ask you or tell you that they are going to do a background check on you (i.e. if they have you sign a release form) i wouldnt disclose the information, as in that case it may do more harm than good. if they are asking for a background check, obvisouly you want to tell them, but give them a good heartfelt explanation of what happened and how its changed you for the better. as someone told me right after i made my mistake "it may seem like this is the biggest mistake you have ever made but in a few years you probably wont think of it anymore", and that was true, i dont really even think about my mistakes, they are still there as a reminder of what not to do, and how far i can fall, but they no longer define me. keep your head man, your gonna do good things.

also i saw that you didnt get much help on r/legaladvice, from what ive seen they are all high and mighty lawyers, who think they are better then everyone else (go figure that lawyers would think that way). IANAL but my advice would be to delete all of these posts right away, lawyer up and keep quiet. you have already stated your location (NJ) and it wouldnt be hard for someone to google the right words and find your posts, which could be connected back to you and used in a case against you. if you want a chance to fight this you **NEED** to take these down now. do not admit to anything until you speak to a lawyer, you did this, and admitted it, but until you have guidance anything you say *can and will be used against you*. 

now obviously what you did was unexcuseable, and your getting some well deserved heat from it, but you really need to stop posting about this if you dont want this all used against you.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-03-05 23:42:32, BODY: if you are naive to the process i would start with 0.25 - 0.5 lbs to begin with, pour the seeds into an empty water jug or soda container, add water to about 2 inches above the seeds, shake them for about five minutes, strain and add lemon juice. from what i have read, and from 2+ years of experience the amount of morphine and codeine can greatly vary from batch to batch, but the numbers that i remember are about 75-150mgs of morphine per pound of poppy seeds (unwashed), but again, its hard to tell. and i dont remember the source of that information, but i know ive read it in multiple places. also pst contains thebaine and codeine in smaller amounts, the thebaine can cause some unpleasant side affects. good luck and be careful, the high lasts a very long time, and please never mix with alcohol or benzos (the few deaths from pst were caused due to mixing of morphine and benzo's) that 17 year old kids parents posted his autopsy report to thier website (poppyseedteakills.com) and he had xanax in his system as well.

Maybe it has to do with the suppression of nerves and/or other systems. Anyways there is nothing to worry about and I often get really bad rebound headaches the following day if I get real high.

(the article, not OP) first of all, i though huffpost was a legitimate news source with journalists, but i guess not. there were so many untrue statements. i dont think they injected her with liquid hydrocodone, maybe hydromorphone, but its not that important.she had overdosed on 7 vicodins? it was honestly like reading a post from the r/drugs sub. also she stated that "most people overdose on molly because you cant tell how much to take in its pure form" **What?** if you have a scale and your responsible, yeah you can. that was one of the dumbest things ive ever read. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-03-12 23:44:05, BODY: yeah, "i took 7 vicodins with no tolerance after i had been abusing them because i instantly became an addict when the doctor shot me up in the hospital but then i ODd and was okay but than i got more and became addicted again and than i took molly and got addicted because im an addict and than i saw jesus and almost died again" *(run on for comedic effect)*. i think that she sees that the addict and alcoholic community gets reactions with their stories, to her it seems like if she tells this story that she will get more respect just as you stated. and if it is a real article than shame on huffpost, the writing was terrible, as if a middle school student or an uneducated person wrote it. but it was a good laugh, good post man.

i found this when searching when it should be used, straight from the manufacturers website. 


**When should NARCAN® Nasal Spray be used?**


*Use NARCAN® Nasal Spray right away if you think there are signs of an opioid overdose emergency.*

**Signs of an opioid overdose may include:**

*Unusual sleepiness and you are not able to awaken the person with a loud voice or by rubbing firmly on the middle of their chest (sternum)*

*Breathing problems including slow or shallow breathing in someone difficult to awaken or who looks like they are not breathing*

*The black circle in the center of the colored part of the eye (pupil) is very small, sometimes called “pinpoint pupils,” in someone difficult to awaken*

*Get emergency medical help right away in any cases of known or suspected overdose. NARCAN® Nasal Spray is not a substitute for emergency medical care. Administer in accordance with the instructions for use.*

if what you are saying is true than **none** of these apply, and they incorrectly administered the drug, and although IANAL i can say that this could constitute medical malpractice. good luck man, and thats serially messed up.

That's ridiculous they treated you like that. 

POST:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-03-25 00:09:52, TITLE: It's time to be honest with myself, it's time to put it down for good, POST BODY: Hi r/opiates!

over the past 5 months or so i have spent quite a bit of time here reading your posts, comments, conversations, your ups and your downs, the losses and the gains. i have read so many posts about people losing everything, saying they are going to put it down, just to pick up again. I don't understand why it is so hard to quit this damn drug, to just stop getting high. what is different with our brains? why is it when we put this drug in our system do we have a reaction to it like we do, where we will do anything and everything for the high. 

My life isn't bad, it never really was. I had a great upbringing, i was a tough kid in the sense that i was really hyper, got into a ton of shouting matches with my folks, but i was never violent, never abused. I don't really understand where my depression comes from, i have not suffered any traumatic experiences that were not of my own doing. i tried to take my own life 2 years ago with methadone, somehow i survived. i spent two weeks in the hospital with kidney failure and rhabdomyolosis, but i came back and everything went back to normal. i deserved it, i did it to myself, but now i have to live with that. my folks are embarrased by that, my mom told me right after i got out of the hospital "how am i supposed to tell people when they ask, you dont deserve the sympathy because this was of your own doing?" they didn't understand how i could feel so low that i would get to that point. 

I thought after that i would be done, i drew a new breath of life, i felt great and had a good job. finally saved some money and bought a car, got a great new job and have a decent bank account. but it is still not enough. i don't even like the feeling anymore, i feel dirty when im high, but i crave it. Why is it when normal people realize something they are doing is destructive they can stop right away, or just avoid it all together, but yet we run towards the chaos. Addiction is like a burning building, everyone is telling us the fire is all around, and we can feel the heat but we just sit there in our favorite chair and turn on the TV. 

I am going to make one final attempt at this. My world has not crashed down around me again....yet, but i can see the cracks in the foundation. i have been getting high on my lunch breaks at work, *oh it will help me work more efficient, i can focus better when i am high*, i can't keep doing that. i want a better life, i don't want this artificial happiness anymore, and i want to know what feelings are like again. 

I fear everything. i am scared child at heart, i see a lot of weakness in me. why can't i beat this? why can't i just put it down and walk away for good. maybe i am just lazy, i havent wanted to put in the work. i know i am stronger than this, i know i am a good person, and i know i can be better. i just want to be done with the excuses. you would think that being on the brink of death would have been enough for me, enough to put it down and walk away. i escaped one fire, walked away with a mere scratch, but the building is starting to heat up again, and this time i have to put out the fire because i have the feeling in the pit of my stomach that i wont be so lucky again. i am stronger than this, we all are, it is there somewhere i just have to find it. i hope by this time next month i will be able to look back at this post and smile, knowing i am in a better place.

It's hard for me to understand why dealers put it in there product, I Understand cutting and trying to stretch the product but if you kill your client base it's not good for business, also if someone warns of fent in someone's dope I'd think people wouldn't buy it. Dealers who put fent in the cut without telling people should be charged with murder if someone dies. What do you think about that?

aint that the truth. opiates also mess with your brain chemistry quite a bit, which im pretty sure you know and it can take months to get that back to normal, especially being on subs your opiate receptors are still being somewhat stimulated so maybe that is why it is taking such a long time to get back to baseline (i could be full of shit but from ive learned this from personal experience). i know my testosterone is pretty much gone from using, i have no sex drive at all right now, and it also messes with other chemicals in your brain. keep your head up man, your headed in the right direction OP.

You have to use Kratom for at least a few weeks straight to become dependent. Also it is weaker so it might not take all of the symptoms away but it helps a lot man I'd use it if I were yoy

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2016-04-23 12:36:07, TITLE: Poppy Seed Tea Addiction, POST BODY: Hi Opiates Recovery! 

I became addicted to poppy seed tea a few years ago and have been using regularly now for over a year and i want to stop this addiction more than anything. it is amazing the rationalization process the brain goes through to obtain more of the drug. i know that i dont want to continue, and i know that i will feel better and it will be out of my system in less than a week but every time i get a few days i end up ordering some more. I have tried to quit over 30 times now and keep failing. I do not have anyone close to me that i can confide in, i have hid my addiction from my family as they think i have been clean all this time. I experienced the worst panic attack i have ever had the other day dealing with the stress of trying to quit, my job, moving to a new place, i just broke down and shook in terror on my couch for hours, i felt catatonic. that was the final wake up call, i am done with this life. i keep thinking of all the money i have wasted on the useless drug, all the credit car debt ive racked up and the anxiety from it paralyzes me.

 i have been able to save up quite a nice amount of money so i am not broke, nor do i have any legal issues, and i have not damaged any family relations, so i am coming out pretty good, so long as i can actually stop. I am 24 hours since my last dose and i am not going to order anymore this time, this drug has taken enough of my life. i cannot confide in my family as they would not understand and i live in a new area so i have no close friends here that would be able to comfort me in my endevour and this makes it even tougher. I have a hopeful mindset, i know that in a few days i will feel so much better and will be much better off. No one else knows of what i am going through so i thought i would reach out to you folks. I am going to make it through this time, i have a trip to Canada planned with my little sister in a month and i want to enjoy this time with her, in fact i want to enjoy the day to day life again, i want to be able to just be happy. I know i can pay off my debts, i have enough money to live comfortably, but i cant stop focusing on all of the things i dont have because of my addiction, it may be vain but its a recurring theme in my mind. Well i think ive mumbled enough now, so here goes nothing guys, i am going to make it this time.

I read almost all of the posts everyday and it breaks my heart when i read about some of your lives. No one deserves to get raped, no matter how you make your living, we are all just trying to get by. I have never lost anyone that i have known to this addiction before, i have never copped on the street, i have never spent a night out homeless, but i do battle my own demons. I have an addiction myself, one that is tearing me apart on the inside. I just can't stop. I think that maybe i am not strong enough, maybe i am just a pussy and cant deal with it, that my life is so rough having an addiction, and than i come here and see how hard life can really be. To all those who are grieving the loss of someone close, to those sitting bedside next to a loved one sick, to those wondering where the money is going to come from to make it another day, please know that i care and i am pulling for you all to make it. I am not super involved with this subreddit but i spend alot of time here reading, and my heart goes out to all of you. If there is anything i can do to help, lend an ear or a hand to someone who really needs it let me know and i will see what i can do.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2016-06-01 12:12:27, BODY: yup, i had all of those as well. the skipped heart beats scared the shit out of me. i would start to get the heart palps after 3-4 days of straight using so i cut back and they stopped. I have been cutting back over the past few weeks, and have only used once in the last two weeks, (i caved and drank some tea today, but i used waaay less than my usual amount and i feel pretty good). i think i am done with this stuff for good. I have had a real rough two years, i almost died two years ago and was hospitalized for awhile and fell into a terrible depression afterwards with severe anxiety that i was going to die at any moment, and i started to drink PST to cope, and it really helped. I was at the bottom of the barrel two years ago, living at my parents house, no car, no money, and a wasted college degree. I used PST as an anti depressant for awhile and was actually able to turn my life around, get a career job and start moving forward. now i have things, a car, a job, a house, money in the bank. the only thing missing is a significant other, i didnt want to start a relationship with someone while using, as i didnt think it was fair. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2016-06-01 12:14:08, BODY: yeah, i do have a high tolerance, and because i have to use more i am not just getting more of the good stuff, i am ingesting more thebaine and all of the other negative alkoloids, which are causing some of these negative side effects. ive cut back my use, only drank it once in the last two weeks, i caved today and decided to drink some but i used waaay less than usual and feel pretty good. hopefully i can stay on the right path and move onto the next phase of my life.

I actually drove out to Amish country on Monday to see if they had any new stock but they didn't (they all buy from the same distributor in my area so each bulk grocery store had the same seeds). Also $5.99 a pound is a rip off for the Amish, the stores I went to all sell for between $3.50-$4.99.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-02 07:56:05, BODY: i used kratom to kick before. it might not take away everything but it certainly helps, in fact i felt pretty good mentally when taking it, i was just a bit sore and cold from the WD. it will certainly help you, in fact it might take away all of your WD symptoms. look for the kratom subreddit on here and there should be a list of preferred vendors you can order from, and as long you buy from that list i can assure you it will help. (dont ever buy it from a head shop, that is where you get your horror stories.)

EDIT* - there are a few states that have banned kratom so if you live in one of the following states you may be SOL.: Tennessee, Wisconsin, Indiana, Florida (only illegal in Sarasota County), Arkansas, Vermont. 

good luck OP, i would reccomend giving it a try, you can order about 100g of the stuff for about $25 with shipping, and a usual dose of it is about 3-4g, so your getting it for about $1 a dose so it's not that expensive.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-03 01:34:32, BODY: because the opiate receptors are still saturated at the moment, and just as with taking subs to early, even if your not dependent they need to be clear before you can take the shot, otherwise it will force the opiates off the receptors and cause PWD.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-03 01:43:21, BODY: i think i am clearly misunderstanding this. i am assuming from what you said that naltrexone does not cause PWD? is it the bupe that causes PWD? how does it work? does naltrexone block opiate receptors? i always assumed that the bupe blocked the receptors. could you explain it for me? (not trying to be a dick i am genuinely interested in the mechanism behind it) 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-03 01:54:40, BODY: thanks, that is interesting, i always (incorrectly) assumed that if you had an opiate on the receptors that if you take an opiate blocker that it would kick them off which would cause the discomfort and precipitated WD, thank you for clearing that up.

It is a cheap, easy, "mostly" legal way to get high as shit on opiates. sadly making a post on r/opiates front page about keeping your cheap, easy, mostly legal opiate high is not exactly the best way to keep that a secret, not saying anything is the best way to achieve that. and my view on the whole situation is that it will probably slowly die out or get way to expensive just like pods did over the past few years, it is what it is. this individual has seen her source dry up this past week and is in panic mode. i agree with all of your points Mr. u/Kofeb

The SN has been getting weaker but as my tolerance drops I've been getting higher. At my peak I could use 5-7 lbs of seeds a day, they were store bought seeds that were probably 1/4 of strength of SN but still man, I was out of fucking control. I was able to rope it in and get my shit together but damn that was rough. The whole time I managed to hold down a solid engineering job which I luckily still have, so I guess I may not have been that bad, but I probably was.

Since posting this two months ago I haven't been able to stop completely. I have cut down to using once.a week but every time I tell myself this is it, no more orders I make another one but I guess going from using almost everyday to ordering once a week is a step in the right direction. I am having trouble convincing myself I can't ever use again, because I can't. I have been eating better, seeing friends again and exercising. My life has been improving as I cut this drug out and I want to take that final step but I'm having trouble. As far as your question about the oxy I would be wary about it, I would be concerned that even that small little taste might be enough for your brain to rationalize going back to the tea. That's just my opinion though and you seem to have a solid foundation and maybe it will be okay. Best of luck man (although I hate that saying, because this is all about putting in the work and doesn't really have anything to do with luck). Send me a PM if you ever need someone to talk to or to relate with. I'm hoping I can hold out on placing another order and quit this for good, I've gotten through the WDs but I keep using a little every week, and even then I don't get the magic it once had.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-21 00:36:20, BODY: i would hit the gym everyday, try and spend as much time as possible in the gym sweating and drinking water. look up some foods on google that help to flush the system (i dont have a super healthy diet so i dont know of any specifics). i know i have passed a drug test in 2 days before and all i did was work out at the gym for like 5 hours both days before the test. mine was for a job i didn't really want so it was not as serious as yours, but good luck man, sounds like you realized your mistake and i hope it works out for you. also go over to the side bar and type in "drug test" or "passed a drug test" and read through every post in which the OP states how they passed a drug test and try and follow those. let us know how its going man and keep your head up. are you going to get locked up if you fail? how much time are you looking at?

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-21 23:38:36, BODY: probably, but creatine and creatanine are different. creatine is a pre workout suppliment and creatanine is a by product of your body and is expelled as a part of urea (waste) in the urine, which gives it its yellow color, and which also is the opposite of diluted urine. so in theory, if you take creatanine (5-HT) it could raise the levels in your urine "un" diluting your pee. this could all be 100% wrong, but this is how i understand it to work. i have never used this method before so please get a second opinion before taking my word for it.

SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2016-06-23 23:44:41, BODY: i think the two day shipping is based on if the product is available in a wharehouse closest to you. if you look the different sizes sometimes have different shipping times. I know for a fact there are two fullfillment centers in my region, one offers same day shipping to me when the product is available, which is great, because 1. i get it the same day, and 2. the same day shipping option is only $7.95. so i believe that they only offer that as an option when you live in an area that they can ship to you within that time frame.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-27 13:20:36, BODY: dont be so hard on yourself, i enjoy making other people happy. sometimes that means spending a little bit too much money to make others around me happy, so to some extent i do this as well. just put your foot down and if someone brings it up just mention that you have to look out for yourself a little bit more. being a good, nice, giving person is a good quality, other people are just wired to take advantage of a situation. i always feel guilty or bad if someone gives me something, for example i came home yesterday after driving 8 hours and my roomate had cooked me a steak dinner (awesome, i know) and i felt guilty taking that from him, even after he said he went out of his way to make it for me.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-03-10 17:25:12, BODY: In the article they go about talking about the new legislation to combat the opiate epidemic. They talk about stricter laws against people who sell drugs that lead to an OD and they talk about setting tighter controls on prescribing opiates. Why hasn't the government come to the realization that punishing the people who use even more will just make things worse. You can lock someone up who has some dope on them for years but from what I've read on here you can get it in jail. Maybe they should introduce some legislation that aims at helping people with addictions, like for example say providing more money for treatment, more available state funded beds. They could provide funds for people to seek out patient therapy like talking to a councilor. We need to introduce programs that encourage people that have a problem to come forward and ask for help. I understand that society is starting to understand that addiction is changing, it's effecting more and more people in more diverse backgrounds, I've seen doctors lawyers and even law enforcement members post about their own addictions, drug addicts are clearly not just the homeless guy flying a sign on the corner.  It bothers me so much that our country (I am an American) is so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to treating addiction. It's time for a change, it's been time for a change.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2017-04-09 19:06:50, BODY: I agree. Most of the reason I stopped paying attention to this sub, super judgemental and preachy about a drug, on a sub about a drug. I've been doing this for three years now and I would have loved to stop many times but I am having a very hard time. I started it personally because I was at the point of suicide (it's a long drawn out story I'd really rather not get into) but this tea saved my life, the living situation I was in at the time and the way my life was going I needed an escape and that's what this provided me. 

I was able to find a great job, buy a car and get my own place to live and furnish it myself all while using tea for my own mental health. Now I want to quit, and I would tell anyone who was thinking about starting this to truly think about the choice they are about to make but I would not put them down or judge them because in the end we are all just trying to feel better. No one ever became a drug addict because life was wonderful and they could deal with everything just fine. 

End rant 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-04-09 19:25:09, BODY: You gotta look at from both sides. Yes, your right it's your choice and if you want to do it they should be cool with it, or at least not threaten to stop speaking to you. If it is that big of an issue wit them they could always just ask you not to bring it around when your all hanging out. It's a shame he didn't listen to your wishes or speak to you a little more about why you used it or what your plans are regarding using it moving forward. It is a very dangerous scary addicting drug though.

The other side though they are probably caught up and seeing what the main stream media is portraying as a crisis in our country (I am jumping to the assumption your an American, as I assume all redditors are white American males until proven otherwise lol) and most of what they know is reported overdoses and horrifying WDs and shaking sweaty people trying to steal your shit. That's not what most opiate addicts or users (not implying your an addict) are like, the face of heroin use has changed to include all people now. 

Anyways, I personally wouldn't get too twisted about their reaction becuse it is probably driven by the media and our society that up until very recently has had a very negative connotation with heroin and opiate use.

I think your confused with something here. If you default on your loans it just means you haven't paid them and aren't capable of paying them, in that case you either settle with the debt or they garnish wages or slowly take it back etc. but no one would go after your family for your debt unless they consigned (not legally anyway)

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2017-07-03 08:57:33, BODY: i sometimes get the heart palpitations when i use to much of the tea. i started getting them after a long binge of using 2lbs a day or more, usually if i use the same seeds for a prolonged amount of time. I went to the doctor while it was happening one time (i would get a skipped heartbeat once every 20 seconds or so, it was terrifying) and when they hooked me up to the ekg machine they said everything was normal. ive noticed that if i switch brands they seem to subside so i have come to the following conclusion; one of the alkaloids on the seeds causes heart palpitations in high enough doses. i am not a doctor and have medical training but i am positive that it is the seeds as i have been checked out and i am healthy otherwise. I reduced my dose when this started happening and i have not run into the issue again.


i though at first when it started happening that i had a potassium deficiency from drinking all the liquid and the urinating it all out, but i took some supplements and ate bananas and it didn't really help it out the palpatations. I developed a pretty bad case of health anxiety when all this was happening and was having consistent panic attacks as well, so i would get dizzy and my heart would start to race and the heart palpitations would get worse and i though i was having a heart attack. all of this lead me to finally realize that i needed to stop my current use or i was probably going to do lasting damage or die. 


i have also read at least two other posts that have mentioned this with the seeds, so it is in my opinion 100% one of the alkaloids in the latex that causes this in higher prolonged doses. I would suggest taking a break (when i stopped for two-three days it went away) or lowering you dose. i would assume that those who take small doses of tea daily dont run into this issue because whatever is causing this is not ingested in a high enough dose. 


you mentioned that you are in denial that the seeds and tea are the cause of this issue but i can tell you at least in my case that it was absolutely the cause of the issue and it went away as soon as i stopped and or reduced my intake. this was a very scary experience to go through for me and it lasted about a week before i finally realized what was happening and i made a change. for what its worth i was using FTL when this all occurred.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2017-07-07 15:22:22, BODY: i lived in one the biggest cities in the nation and spent the better part of 3 years searching for a legit source, i probably visited over 50 shops in about a 100 mile radius over the years and only found active seeds at less than 10 places. 6 of the 10 were amish grocers and they all used the same source so when that source started shipping out bunk seed they were useless to me, the other 4 were other grocery stores (some organic, one was a bulk nut supplier and that was the best one for about a year) and the other two were a larger chain grocery store that had a bulk section but even they switched to non active seeds over time. 

In my quest for a cheap, local, fresh vendor ive spent many a hours on the road looking, some of the in WD (the first 2.5 years of my use i did not know of the big three or online ordering, i only sourced locally and put a ton of miles on my new car searching out a good source) but when i finally switched to ordering online there were no local vendors selling seeds that were active. i am also not embelishing when i say i went to over 50 stores, its probably much more. 

some quick advice from personal experience, 

-every single indian grocery that sold seeds sold white poppy seeds and those did not work for me.

-i went to over 10 asian grocery stores, not one carried poppy seeds (i do not think they are used in chinese culture) 

-i went into a ton of organic "health" grocery stores, and did find poppy seeds in the bulk sections and would usually buy some to try them out, not once......never did they work. 

-i would say look for a "bulk nut, spice, seed" store in your area and give it a try, dont get your hopes up though. 

- Also you could always ask your local bagel shop / deli if they would sell you some poppy seeds in bulk / who do they use, sometimes you could find a good cheap bulk source through that. i never asked this because i was concerned with coming off as a desperate addict (at least thats what i thought in my head) but its worth a shot

hope this helps!

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-07-24 00:20:47, BODY: Great post man. I've "lurked" here now for a few years and seen many of the users come and go, some get clean and some die. When I see a post about someone dying it effects me and although I can't relate to a lot of what people are going through (I do have an active addiction it's just not to dope or pills but an opiate nonetheless) I can empathize with everyone. 

I truly wonder if someone scrolls through these posts and actually decides not to use because of it, and if we reach and save one person from the hell that is opiate addiction then I think we've done our job

SUBREDDIT: PoppyTea, TIME: 2017-07-27 19:13:39, BODY: I ordered a 20lb box and the first bag was these today. They are certainly weaker then the last bags which is a let down but they still at least work, they are not a 1/10. I'd give them a 4/10 (not great but not the worst) 

*edit - this batch is pretty bad compared to the amazing quality we have been getting. I've ordered only WGN over the last month and a half and it's been great so I'm very disappointed with this batch

What they are selling is a crime in the US (the washing of the seeds can be seen as "manufacturing a controlled substance", all other vendors do not ever speak about what they are used for. My guess is some guy in Nigeria or China set the website up. Let us know how it goes though

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-08-27 15:31:12, TITLE: Question about abscess, POST BODY: Hey guys, quick question here about an abscess that I think I've got. I've never had one before and I don't shoot or use dope (I use another form of opiates for what it's worth). 

I have what I think is a skin abscess on my ass cheek and I don't know if I should see a doctor about it, it's small, size of dime or so and it doesn't hurt. It's red with a small black / blue area in the center and it looks like skin is peeling away from the edges. 

Will this go away on its own if it occurred naturally? I googled it and got contradictory advice. I've got health insurance but don't have a lot of time with work so if it will go away on its own that would be cool. 

Thanks guys,

SUBREDDIT: poppytea, TIME: 2017-09-26 18:30:49, TITLE: WGN wal order just shipped, POST BODY: A lot of people here have placed orders via the wall to be delivered by Thursday and I just checked for the 100th time today and it finally shipped. 

Just thought I'd let everyone know. 

On a side note if you can I would stock up and place a large order and taper down. I have a total of 70lbs of seed coming in the next week and I plan to use that to taper over a month or two (got enough of the same stock to make sure I can taper). As a previous commenter mentioned they are waiting for the harvest to come in and might not get it anytime soon. 

I've been using this for 3 years on and off and in my personal opinion this is happening due to the stricter laws on opioids in the US. A lot of people are being cut off from their prescriptions and are turning to new methods. This sub has gained quite a large following over the last 8 months to a year and I think it is indicative of the situation as a whole. 

For anyone who isn't too deep I know this is probably said a lot but take it from a veteran in this game, you don't want to be a veteran in this game. I have my own reasons for using the seed and I can honestly say that my life has gotten better since I've stated using it (not sure there is a direct correlation there) but I live by the delivery man, if I can't get my order I panic. I start to feel the WDs creeping in, even if I'm not actually physically sick the mental anguish of not knowing where your next fix is coming from sucks, i am a seed junkie. A white collar, guy next store junkie albeit. 

Please take this "seedpocalyse" as a wake up call and taper down. For those of us who are addicted to this we can beat it. 

Good luck and Godspeed!

SUBREDDIT: poppytea, TIME: 2017-10-03 19:31:54, TITLE: 09/18 WGN - Light tea but good effects, POST BODY: I ordered a large amount of seed just before it all went to shit and was very worried that they would be the same 8/18s I had at the time (red seeds, plant matter, light wash no bitterness). Well they came and they were all labeled 9/18 and looked exactly the same. 

Well I made up a batch and the wash came out light and lacked bitterness, tasted the same as the ones before. Drank my tea this morning and was very surprised that they gave me a nice body buzz (the last batch of seeds lacked a body high, it just gave me slight mood elevation). 

Overall I would rate these a 6.5 out of 10. 

I am using this stock to taper down and get off. I just started a new job I would consider my dream job a few months ago so this sucks. Hopefully a taper, kratom and some lope will make it bearable. 

I look at this as a blessing to be honest. I need to quit, as an addict it was very hard to quit on my own without some sort of push and this will give me the push I need. I've used for 3 years now and my life has gotten better for the most part. 

Good Luck guys, I am going to unsub from this place so I don't get tempted to place another order, I think it's better that way. I really hope it all works out for you guys. 

Much love

EDIT - I wrote this post to give a little hope to anyone who has some of those bags laying around. I hope those who decide to quit can stay strong! , PERMALINK: /r/PoppyTea/comments/744npb/0918_wgn_light_tea_but_good_effects/

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: worldnews, TIME: 2019-06-06 10:48:15, BODY: \*this is not specifically directed at your comment, it speaks to your argument but i am commenting on a larger conversation i have seen, so please do not take this as a personal attack on your comment.

I agree about the amount of passes given out and the fact that Nepal is and should take responsibility for that. However i have seen quite a few arguments about them being responsible for granting un qualified climbers with permits. Aside from wanting to protect their own citizens who work there (it doesn't seem like they do) from endangering themselves trying to drag an un qualified climber up the mountain i do not think it should be there responsibility to vet people who want to climb that mountain.

&amp;#x200B;

I have watched the Mt Everest documentary on HBO Real sports and they kept pushing the notion that Nepal needs to vet these people. i have a problem with that. Where in our world did people stop being accountable for their own actions? If I, right now decided to climb that mountain id die half way up, i cant do it as i've never climbed but one mountain in my life. but that is MY DECISION, and MY RESPONSIBILITY. If i get in my car and decide to drive 120 mph and then smash into a wall on a turn that's my fault, i decided to do something i wasn't qualified for (that may be a bad analogy but hopefully you get the point.)

&amp;#x200B;

It is so frustrating to watch people try and blame others for someones one conscious decision. the only people Nepal should be held responsible for is their own, the Sherpa who risk their lives daily on that mountain. there should be more vetting of the companies run by foreigners who take people up the mountain.

&amp;#x200B;

If i want to pay $50,000 to probably die then let me do so. don't blame the country i go to do it in.

The physical symptoms suck don't get me wrong but you also can't think straight, I find that I can't concentrate on anything at all. Even with immodium and a good taper can keep alot of the physical symptoms at bay the mental fatigue and crazy mood swings are also a huge factor. I've managed to go to work during alot of my time in WD but I'll find it's an absolute battle to focus for more then 10 minutes anything. And even when I can stay on task I'm usually some level of confused and I can't seem to see things I normally do (in my job that is, not my actual vision). 

It always sucks when the bill comes due but damn do I enjoy the wracking up that debt

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2019-06-13 19:57:51, BODY: I've been there man. 5 years ago I woke up one day after struggling with life and addiction and had just had enough. I didn't want to do it anymore. I would spend entire days locked in a small room crying to myself with no hope for the future. I woke up 36 hours after I tired to OD. Spent two weeks in the hospital and months on dialysis. 

I don't have it all figured out. The only thing that changed with my external circumstances. I got a good job, that job got me money and led to a new car and a apartment which led to another job. I've lost two of those jobs due to non drug addiction issues but I've thankfully never been at the point where I truly feel okay with dying again. I am happier, even if it is fleeting. I've got my issues but it gets better man, or at least that's what I've been told. I still barely make enough to cover my expensed due to student loans and debt from my past life but I'm trying and today I woke up and I didn't want to end it, I haven't felt that way in years. 

Sometimes it's just a lucky break. I hope it gets better for you man I'm rooting for you

SUBREDDIT: worldnews, TIME: 2019-06-26 19:19:52, BODY: I appreciate you taking the time to explain why you support Trump. I honestly wonder why and how people still support him after his actions and this explains some of it (I mean that in a sincere tone). Yelling at each other won't change anything. 

I made the mistake of voting for him because I hated Hilary and the Democrats at the time, and while I still don't exactly support them outright I will not vote for anyone who supports the Trump admin or doesn't at least speak up against some of his actions. 

Are you okay with starting a war with Iran? And if you are, why? Didn't trump explicitly say he would end those types of wars? John Bolton is going to get us into that war. 

How do you justify the constant, easily provable lies he tells on a daily basis? The entire sub Reddit trumpcririzestrump exists for a reason. He cannot manage to speak in understandable, intelligent and coherent sentences unless it's written down and even then he struggles. 

These are honest questions and I can assure you I'm not out to attack you because I hate Trump, rather I truly want to understand what his followers really believe.

SUBREDDIT: iamatotalpieceofshit, TIME: 2019-07-29 21:44:28, BODY: Man I went through this at my last job. I sat next to this guy at work for 8 months. He was about 45 years old, shorter guy, a little overweight and he was single. He would talk about the one time he was married years ago and say he was "happily divorced". He invited me to go golfing with him and his group of single guy friends (I am a guy as well) one time. I went with one of my friends and while I never had the thought that he was a pedo there was always something a little off about the guy. 

One day at work I see that he is meeting with the top people at my comapny. It's a smaller office with a glass conference room so I could tell it was something serious by the looks on everyone's faces. One of the managers came over at one point and shut off his computer and took the tower away. We were told later in the day that he had resigned from his position effective immediately. 

Two weeks later we were all sat down and the owner of the company told us he was charged with 4 counts of manufacturing and distribution of child porn. It actually messed with me for a bit, knowing I talked to this guy everyday and that he would go home and trade child porn with his friends, that I had met. 

Like I said I never had the feeling he was a pedo but looking back at everything I can see that there was something off about the guy in hindsight. He was certainly a little odd.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: iamatotalpieceofshit, TIME: 2019-07-30 06:58:19, BODY: I'm not sure to be honest. I looked up the legal description in the state I lived in and I don't think it actually meant he was physically abusing anyone because there were no other sex charges on him, just the child porn charges. But that doesn't mean he just didn't get caught

Edit : I was curious so I went ahead and checked his name and he is on the sex offender registry now but it says he was convicted of sexual exploration of a minor. Tbh I also don't know exactly what that means he did. I am pretty sure he didn't though because it says he only has to be a registered sex offender for a minimum of 10 years and that he didn't serve any jail time. Even after 4 convicted charges. Sad

SUBREDDIT: phillies, TIME: 2019-11-01 11:18:42, TITLE: Looking ahead to free agency - Top available Pitchers, POST BODY: Out of the starting pitchers who is in the rotation opening day? Who are the best options for free agent additions? What does our starting 5 look like on opening day?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Aaron Nola (12-7, 3.87 ERA)
2. Jake Arrieta (8-8, 4.84 ERA)
3. Cole Hamels? (7-7, 3.81 ERA) FREE AGENT
4. Zach Eflin (do they give him another shot at this) (10-13, 4.15 ERA)
5. Spencer Howard ?? (3-1, 2.03 ERA) MINOR LEAGUES, #2 PROSPECT IN ORGANIZATION
6. Adonis Medina ?? (7-7, 4.94 ERA) MINOR LEAGUES #6 PROSPECT IN ORGANIZATION he had a very disappointing year

Top pitching free agents that i think we could realistically acquire aside from Cole Hamels.

Gerrit Cole (20-5, 2.50 ERA) I don't think we can get Cole, but that is just a personal feeling

Madison Bumgarner (9-9, 3.90 ERA)

Zach Wheeler (11-8, 3.96 ERA) Fuck the Mets

Jake Odorizzi (15-7 3.51 ERA) I really like this guy, honestly he would be my top pick for us to go after

~~Yu Darvish (6-8, 3.98 ERA), record doesnt show how effective he was this year~~  (picked up option)

Wade Miley (14-6, 3.98 ERA), had a good year with Houston, could be a good addition

Brett Anderson (13-9, 3.89 ERA), had a good year with Oakland

Gio Gonzalez (3-2, 3.50 ERA) he was injured this year

~~Corey Kluber (3-2, 5.80 ERA) he was injured this year but won 20 games last year~~ (picked up option)

Homer Bailey (13-9 4.57 ERA) he has not been very good over the last 5 years or so, he was affective down the stretch for Oakland this year but i do not want him on our staff.

Anyone have any ideas on free agent position players we could go after? what are your thoughts on the pitchers i listed above?, PERMALINK: /r/phillies/comments/dq6gky/looking_ahead_to_free_agency_top_available/

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: phillies, TIME: 2019-11-02 02:02:58, BODY: I think that once a player accumulates 5 years of MLB experience they can refuse being optioned. Of course that does not include rehab assignments. I may be wrong here so don't take that for certain fact but a quick Google search returned those results. 

He may have other specific language in his contract but I would assume that a former Cy Young winner isn't going to be optioned to AAA. 

With that being said I am still holding out hope he can return to his previous form or at least be more effective this year. Sadly I think with his injuries building up over time he will have a very hard time getting back to his former self but dude is in good physical shape and seems at least work hard, he is a giant douche canoe though

SUBREDDIT: sixers, TIME: 2019-11-06 22:51:29, BODY: While this was a disappointing game as was the sun's game the sky isn't falling. It's the first 7 games of the year and we are 5-2. It's a new roster and this team has to gel first. There are so many teams that get off to much worse starts then we are having that end up winning a title so let's just take a deep breath and ride it out.

There are absolutely aspects that need to be improved but the fact of the matter is one of our top rotation players went down and we still only lost a road game to a top western conference squad by 2, it's not like we got our doors blown off.

With that being said, if we are gonna win a title Ben Simmons needs to step the fuck up and be the player we all expected him to be and not just dribble right and throw up a runner with his off hand

Javale McGee

Carl Landry

Also there were some dudes I don't even remember ever playing for us nor do I even remember anything about but apparently did in Furkan "Not Korkmaz" Aldemir and some dude named Phil Pressey.

Tony Wroten lead the team in scoring, Big Shot Bob had a good year and then we had dudes that never lived up to expectations like Nerlens and Jahlil.

I am a huge basketball fan (Philadelphia to be exact) and I didn't like LeBron when he pulled his stunt to go to Miami. He made this huge deal and made sure it was all about himself to just to sign a contract. I lost the respect I had for him when he did that

When it comes to China I think he is the one that is uneducated about it. I don't think he gives one fuck about anything or anybody in China nor does he care to learn. I bet he was told by his management team not to come out in support of the protests, I bet you he was given the exact statement he said by someone else and didn't actually care enough to look further into it. It shows what his true character is, or lack there of one.

I think he has been in right for most of his career. I don't think Cutch has the speed especially with his knee to go full time in center. 

I like Didi. I could see working something out between him and Segura with SS and 3B and having Kingrey play 2nd (maybe switch those around). What's the status with Cesar? Is he back next year and if so are we looking to trade him? He has been one of more consistent contact hitters in recent years.  

I don't like Matt Carpenter. His best years are behind him, I'd be okay with a bench role / giving Jake Lamb a shot, he had some pop with 28 and 30 HR seasons in recent years, a guy with a chance at a bounce back like you said. Same thing with Shaw, dude had some real good years power wise with Milwaukee. Both could do well in a hitters park. 

I'd also be okay with giving Freeland a shot at the 5th spot but with a backup plan in mind. Depending on if we miss on Hammels and or MadBum having a lefty who recently won 17 games could turn out well for us. I think Dellin is a good bullpen move, I'd be down for that. What happened to Alex Wood this year, was it injuries? 

Good research man, well done with putting together those players. I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on those guys if you have some time to explain why you think some of them may fit.

I have read a ton about the second world war and nazi germanys use of drugs in the blitzkrieg. the soldiers were are fucked to high heaven on meth during those invasions. Its a large reason in why both Poland and France fell so quickly, when your high on meth you dont stop.

Also i am sure alot of people here are aware of this but Hitler was the biggest junkie of all. Alot of his downfall is linked to his drug use. He had this fat little quack follow him around (Theodore Morel) and shot him up with all kinds of drugs daily, cocaine, meth, morphine and eukadol, bull semen.........yeah, Hitler was shot up with bull semen. Oh and alot of this treatment was justified because Hitler had gas, literally dude would bust ass all day everyday and he wanted it treated.

It was happenstance that I saw it that day otherwise I really don't think I'd ever have seen it. 

I think I've come to the conclusion that there is no reason to let societal norms dictate what I do or why. I've done other shit I wouldn't tell people about because I enjoyed it so why would this be any different. Im not hurting myself or anyone else so why not indulge.

SUBREDDIT: religiousfruitcake, TIME: 2020-10-30 10:25:02, BODY: Honest questions, and even though it may sound like it I promise this isnt an attack on you. These are just real questions i want to asks someone who truly believes in this. 


Doesnt God "have a plan for us all?" Isnt there some sort of pre determined path for us? Does God not have control of what happens? Why would god plan for 6 million innocent men woman and children to be murdered in the gas chambers? 20 years before that, why did God let the ottomans murder 1 million innocent men woman and children. 

Also, if there is what you would refer to as a God why would he not make himself known? Why does he play this "game" of follow this book written by men a long time ago in a different era and if you follow it "good enough" then maybe youll get to heaven? 

And if you dont follow his book or are a non believer then you go to hell.  Seeing as christianity makes up about 30% of the worlds population do you truly believe that 70% of the world is condemned to an afterlife of hell? Why would a merciful God that you believe in condem billions of people to hell. What happens to people who know nothing of your book? 

Maybe its a little deeper for me, maybe im angry at being raised a devout catholic and then learning that the church expected me not to question. As i grew and my questions got deeper i stopped getting real answers and was just told to "have faith" but thats not good enough for me.

I've followed these posts nightly. Working from home most of the time, masks, I didn't attend gatherings of groups I was invited too and my social life has disappeared as a result. And I know I can still get together in small groups socially distanced but it just isn't the same.

Even on his website he basically admits to a crime as sirens arent allowed per florida statue.

The stolen valor part of this is what gets to me the most. I never served, family has but not me. Its clear that he has used it to get favor, and most likely discounts as well at stores. Im sure he asks for the military discount wherever he goes. From what I understand stolen valor isnt a crime until you benefit financially from the claim. Im sure there is proof of that happening somewhere. 

My only question is did the local PD actually allow him to get away with this? Its been hinted at in some of the videos as well as that email that the previous chief allowed him to do what he was doing. I would like to know why.

POST:
SUBREDDIT: recruitinghell, TIME: 2020-12-18 11:05:00, TITLE: What industries are you all a part of?, POST BODY: So i just started browsing this sub recently. What industry are the people here are in? It seems like a lot of IT jobs and general business positions (sales / finance / marketing) but I am sure its a bit of everything. I'm curious to know what industries find it the hardest to land a new job. 

I feel for each and every one of you. I remember how it took me 2 years to find a job when i got out of school in 2013. I didnt have an internship because I refused to take an unpaid position because i needed to support myself. I remember how hopeless i felt living at home with my parents at 26 working at Bed Bath and Beyond. I hated that job but i was so beat down by looking for a career position that i had no energy to even look for a new day to day retail job. 

I graduated college with a degree in landscape architecture. Because the housing market was down with the bubble alot of my industry fell apart. I applied to over 100 jobs in the span of that 2 years. I would spend half the day putting together a custom portfolio of my work to try and match what the firm did. It was so defeating. I see people here applying to thousands of jobs here and i cant imagine what that would be like. 

My field is somewhat small, there may be 10-15 LA firms in a larger city and maybe a couple in the smaller cities. I would google local firms and just email the owners and eventually I got an in person meeting. That company didnt have a position for me but 2 weeks later the owner put me in touch with his friend who was hiring and i got my first job. 

Since landing my first career job at 27 back in 2015 ive changed jobs twice. I got laid off after 3 years from my first job and found a new position a month later and moved on a year later from that one, again finding a job within a month. Now that the housing market has returned its been easier to find work. I now live in the fastest growing city in the US and there is too much work for our medium sized office but im not complaining, i dont take it for granted that i have a stable job in this climate. Everytime i want to complain that i have to work a few extra hours a week i remember the stories ive read here and that grounds me. 

I also remember during my last job search being contacted by a recruiter. He called me and told me he had 2 local companies looking to hire. I sent him my portfolios and resume and then heard nothing. He had the gall to tell me to hold off accepting any offers until I heard back from him and then never contacted me again. I landed a job on my own pretty quick but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Now after coming to this sub it makes sense and it seems that this is common. Its a shame. These people are fucking with the lives of desperate folks who need jobs. I didnt have months of rent saved up. I needed to find work immediately. If i had listened and trusted him i would have gotten evicted from my apartment waiting to hear back. 

Keep your head up. I believe in each and every one of you. The world may be in flames right now but it'll get better., PERMALINK: /r/recruitinghell/comments/kfp0vb/what_industries_are_you_all_a_part_of/

SUBREDDIT: sixers, TIME: 2020-12-18 19:52:35, BODY: James Harden is one of the best players in the NBA hands down, he can carry a team on his shoulders like Kobe did with the Lakers after Shaq left.

But there is a reason he hasn't won a title in Houston. There is a reason that Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook didnt work out. He is not a team player and if the latest news reports are true he has a shit attitude as well. Plus as Westbrook said he takes plays off if he doesn't get the ball and he slacks on D. 

Simmons has his own issues, cant shoot for shit, struggled in the post season with the half court. 

The way i see it Harden will never win a title. He doesn't have the right attitude to get it. Simmons may never develop into a super star all nba player (although he is a 2 time all star / all nba defender) but id like to see where Simmons goes in the next few years and give Doc a chance with this squad.

I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I social distanced, I always wore a mask and washed my hands and used sanitizer. Now for Christmas and my vacation that I've been waiting for months for will be spent alone in my apartment.

Of course I can't say for sure but I work in an office where nobody wore a mask or adhered to the social distancing guidelines. Except for me. I wore my mask while in my office and kept my distance. 

FWIW I have a mild case, no cough or chest congestion. I feel like crap but I can deal with it. I have a PS4 with a bunch of games and someone who's going to go get some more groceries for me so I'll be okay. 

Keep fighting Austin, it's a real fucking shame that there are so many shitty selfish people out there who literally cannot even wear a mask for the few minutes outside their home to save another life.

I can't think straight for the life of me. It's like when you start a sentence and then forget what your going to say but it keeps happening over and over again. I've also been exhausted. I think I slept 16 hours today. Even the small task of taking a shower is physically draining and I was running 2 or 3 miles a day prior to getting sick. 

I'm hopeful that I am getting better though. It really sucked having to spend my hard earned PTO asleep on my couch because I was stuck at home but it could have been worse. At least it seems I'm going to be okay and I'll count my blessings for that.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: nottheonion, TIME: 2021-03-29 15:03:10, BODY: Why does the church say "this is an attack on my faith" whenever something is put forth that supports lgbtq rights? 

Is religion such a fragile concept that the mere acknowledgement and legal protection of a transgender person will break it? Are they saying that including language that protects gay people will thier members gay? 

Or is it the fact that they clearly recognize that as society becomes more accepting of everyone that they will start to realize how absurd the way that churchs act is and thier numbers will drop faster then they already are? 

I grew up catholic and things like this story is why i left and stopped believing in God. If the world was truly created in his image and our current society is what we have then god is a truly fucked being.

My coworkers knew I had kidney issues in the past (not why of course) but since i live in Texas around conservative Christians covid wasnt as big of a deal to them as it was to me. I could have quit but then how during a pandemic would have i found a new job. So i was stuck. Im just glad i made it too. Im doing much better.

SUBREDDIT: exmormon, TIME: 2021-03-31 10:24:07, BODY: Can someone help me understand why the church sees the need to collect all of this wealth? I am nevermo, and in fact ive never lived in a mormon community, dont think ive ever spent time with mormons but I am fascinated by how this church built such a following over the last 150 years. I dont intend to be disrespectful in any manner, just curious. 

Ive seen comments about filling the store houses for the end times. Is this what this about? If that is what it this is about how is american currency going to help the mormons (sorry i believe you now go by LDS) in the afterlife? How is a mall going to help anybody in the end times. 

What do members of the church believe thier tithing is being used for? Ive read that your bishop sets up meetings to ask you invasive questions and berate you about your personal finances. When he is doing that what is he telling you your money is being used for? Does paying more buy you a spot in heaven? Is it like a prosperity preacher?

My aim here is to understand, if i can why people are a part of this church. What do they believe. Im agnostic myself, was raised catholic in New Jersey but left and lost my faith during my teenage years when i learned about the awful sex scandals. 

As an outsider with no firsthand experience of life in LDS communities i found the vibe in Salt Lake City very confusing. I only drove through and spent 2 days in SLC and 1 in St George but there were a handful of super chill folks but the majority of people walking around made me feel like i had been transported to a different time. Long skirts, temples everywhere. The bars are odd, i was told i couldnt order more then one drink and when I went for my 6th or 7th beer I got cut off. Ive never had that happen before

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: exmormon, TIME: 2021-03-31 11:30:43, BODY: Thank you for your explanations. Ive honestly just assumed most of it is that your taught this from birth by your parents and community and from what ive seen the church tries to suppress the truth so its hard to figure it out yourself. Of course now with the internet its becoming harder and harder to suppress that truth, and so your left with things like Fair Mormon. The thing that started all of this interest for me was seeing one of those awful TITS videos. How those people thought that using a juvenile acronym for a show that awkwardly tries to make fun of someone who lost thier testimony and openly talks about it would change peoples opinions is beyond me. As an outsider it just drives home the overall feeling of "holy shit its a cult"

i did a quick search through the posts here and i couldnt find my answer so i wanted to ask here. I am playing 21 and in my current season as the 76ers. I had an injury to Dwight Howard and wanted to add Paul Reed to my active roster. He is currently assigned to my G League team but when i select his name on the roster menu i do not get the option to call him up. I can only edit, release, etc. But no option to call him up. I have an open spot on my active roster to move him into.

&amp;#x200B;

What is going on here? Is there some roster specific rule that i am not understanding? He hasnt been on my NBA roster at all yet during my current season.

SUBREDDIT: suboxone, TIME: 2021-06-08 15:02:17, TITLE: Struggling with reducing dose, POST BODY: I've been on Suboxone for about 16 months now. I'm on 8mg per day down from 12 and I'm going through doubting myself, craving and feeling like I'm stuck. I've been addicted to drugs for 12 years. I wasn't always physically dependent on a substance but I certainly abused them. Uppers, downers, opiates. I've always masked my use by maintaining a career, my own place and relationships. 

The crutch that I use to cover up is my crippling lack of self confidence. I've always felt ugly, or fat, or less then. Opiates provided me with a way to stop feeling like that but eventually those feelings returned and then I was left feeling bad about myself but with a crippling addiction. 

I've made SO much progress over the last 16 months. I've saved thousands of dollars, built a real savings account. I've lost 40 lbs and I run 3 miles a day. I've started dating again with my new found confidence and my life has gotten better then I could have imagined. For the longest time I was able to overcome those feelings of self doubt by just forcing myself to go for it. Stop questioning and just do it. Running has helped immensely. 

If I have to go back to my previous dose that's okay with me but I want to break through. I know that these feelings are mostly in my head because Suboxone WD doesn't start immediately for me. In fact I once forgot my meds and went 72 hrs without a dose and was fine. But that time I was with friends and not by myself. Its when I get alone with my thoughts that the doubt and feelings of the medicine wearing off crop up. 

For those who have successfully worked thier way off this stuff how did you do it? This is the first time in over a year I've had cravings of using again and I'm not going to give in. I've got my next appointment coming up and my doctor is awesome so I can talk to her about these issues but I want to find a better way to deal with it. 

It is going to take a long time to re train my brain and my reward pathways to live a healthy substance free life. 12 years of coping with drugs isn't something I can get over quickly. 

I've never posted here before but I thought I'd give it a shot. Thanks, PERMALINK: /r/suboxone/comments/nvcylg/struggling_with_reducing_dose/

SUBREDDIT: nba, TIME: 2021-07-08 15:35:18, BODY: I stopped watching anything ESPN related about 7 years ago. I'll watch the big games but I never watch the half time shows. Once they changed "sports center" from actually showing highlights to them spending 40 minutes talking about how either Lebron James or Tom Brady is the greatest of all time 3 minutes of highlights and 17 minutes of ads I was done. 

It's a shame because of it I've drifted away from being a huge sports fan to someone who follows my favorite teams but is no longer closely following everything. ESPN legitimately ruined sports for me and I'm sure it has for alot of other people. 

I also stopped paying for cable so that played a big part

SUBREDDIT: ABoringDystopia, TIME: 2021-07-09 11:00:45, BODY: Dude this couldn't be more true. I got covid in December because the owner of my company (a small civil engineering office) decided he needed to watch me work. They are hard line right wing trump supporters, and before I didn't care about politics but because of that they didn't believe COVID was an issue. Well I got sick. And I was pissed. I told the people I was around that I had covid symptoms as it was right before Christmas and I got scolded for doing so. I would have quit but I'm not financially stable enough to do so and started looking for a new job. 

Now last week I got covid again. Even though I had the vaccine I'm one of those breakthrough cases. Got it from being an airplane that got stuck at the gate for hours without the air con being on. Plane was full. 

So I went into the office the first few days because I thought it was just a cold. Well after 7 days of not feeling better I got a covid test. Positive. So at least I'm working from home for now but I was told not to tell people that I had it again. I didn't listen. 

Thankfully I have an offer from a new job and I'm waiting for the paper work to be finalized and I can quit

They truly believe that God has given them the right to this land. Personally I don't believe in God and I just try and be a good human so I can't understand this conflict. But what I do know is stealing people's homes, murdering them, putting an entire country under military rule isn't going to make it any better. 

On the flip side firing rockets, blowing yourself up, attacking and kidnapping random children won't fix it either. There is no solution and I don't think there ever will be. Which is a very pesimastic view but it's what I think.

I'm sitting in my apartment still sick after 9 days right now. It's not that bad and it's merely annoying right now but for people who think having anti bodies will protect them it won't. 

But in the end these people have been lied too by people who do know, people who have lied for financial gain or political gain. At the top, those who spread these lies know exactly what they are doing. It's frustrating and at this point I do not feel any pity for any of those who get it and die.

I hold the republicans responsible for all of these deaths now. I used to get angry over this shit but now I'm at the stage of apathy. I just don't care anymore.

Get vaccinated. I'm currently sick with covid for the second time. And I'm vaccinated. And because I've taken precautions to protect myself neither time was that bad.

The second time was after I got the vaccine. I flew on a plane at the end of June to visit family. The plane was packed and got stuck at the gate for 3 hours. AC was off, plane was full and hot. I got sick two days later. Because I got the vaccine it was more like an annoying cold. Just to get the point across on how minor it was, I thought it was a cold and on the 5th day (while still feeling sick but waiting for test results) I went out and ran my usual two miles. It wasnt easy but if I could run two miles with covid after getting vaxxed that should explain how it's not that bad.

SUBREDDIT: LeopardsAteMyFace, TIME: 2021-07-26 00:01:26, BODY: Same here. Got the moderna vax in March and got covid. I actually had covid before the vax over Christmas because my republican loving, church going, holier then thou and I don't need a vaccine coworkers and boss assumed if they weren't watching me that I wasn't working. So even though my job job I can and did do fully remote moved back to the office during the peak of my cities second wave. The day i tested positive was the day that over 1,000 cases were recorded. That was one of only two days that happened. 

Thankfully I put my two weeks in last week and even though I wanted to just walk out I work in a small industry and can't do that. 

I am finally recovering from my second bout. I got that from an airplane and I did it to myself. I traveled on a full flight that got delayed and we sat at the gate on a hot plane for 3 hours. I started feeling sick two days later. Both times I got it I never got any chest symptoms, just a sore throat, headache and lethargy that lasted for 3 weeks. I'm just past three weeks on my second go around and was able to go back to running this week so I'm almost back to 100%.
