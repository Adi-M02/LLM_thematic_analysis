SUBREDDIT: nosleep, TIME: 2019-03-05 17:07:24, TITLE: My summer internship is not at all what I expected it to be, POST BODY: *My bedroom door creaks open, a mysterious shadow looming in the doorway. It approaches me, and I feel its skeletal hand clasp my neck as it towers over me. My throat burns and I feel a stinging pain across my neck.  I can’t breathe, I can’t move, I can’t speak.*

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up in a cold sweat, my throat coarse, yearning for water. It felt like I had been screaming all night, but I probably would have woken up Jason if that was the case. I got up slowly, stretching as I made my way through piles of papers on the floor towards the bathroom. Yesterday was the last day of finals, and Jason and I had been having late night study sessions on the floor every night for a week. I’d have to pack up and get on the train to go home today. I was incredibly unexcited. I had applied to several summer internships, but heard back from none of them. I’d be spending the next few months on my mom’s couch watching Netflix.

&amp;#x200B;

As I finished my business in the bathroom, I heard Jason getting out of bed. I walked out of the bathroom and said good morning to him, but he straight up ignored me. He seemed fixated on my bed. He stared at it, his jaw dropped.

&amp;#x200B;

“Close your mouth dude, you’re gonna catch flies,” I joked nervously.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I realized why he was staring.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in my bed. No, not me. *My body* was in my bed. I was across the room, watching my roommate approach my body with shaking hands. He reached out and as if to check my pulse, and nearly gagged when he saw the deep red gash going across my throat. I got closer, and saw my body lying under blood-stained covers. My shirt, my pillow, my sheets; they were all soaked with blood that had apparently spilled out from my neck.

&amp;#x200B;

*I’m dead. I’m fucking dead. What the fuck?*

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered the dream I had last night. I started panicking, what if that was real? What if that *thing* killed me in my sleep? Am I a ghost now? What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I went out into the hall of my building and paced, trying to understand the situation. I could hear Jason crying on the phone with someone, probably the cops or our RA, inside my dorm. 

&amp;#x200B;

*This can’t be happening.*

&amp;#x200B;

I leaned against the wall, watching people pass me without notice, saying goodbye for the summer. Suddenly, I saw someone- or *something*\- at the end of the hall that caught my attention. At first it seemed like a kid in dark jeans and a black hoodie, but as it got closer I realized its hands were skeletal. Its face was completely white and gaunt, covered mostly by the hood. I froze in fear as it came right up to me and put out its hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Ever heard of a handshake, buddy?” the entity asked after a minute of uncomfortable silence.

&amp;#x200B;

“What the hell are you?” I blurted out.

&amp;#x200B;

“Kids these days, no manners.” It shook its head and put its hand down. “I'm Elrik. Also known as Death, the Grim Reaper, etcetera; and I’m also your new boss.”

&amp;#x200B;

I continued staring at the emo skeleton in front of me, convinced I was going insane. We stood in silence, I couldn’t seem to form a proper sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

“You applied for my internship a month or two ago, I got your application in the mail. You were the only one who applied, I’m here to pick you up so we can get to work. Big quota today,” Elrik explained.

&amp;#x200B;

I had filled out so many applications I couldn’t remember where I sent them at this point, but you’d think I’d remember sending my resume to the grim reaper.

&amp;#x200B;

“Am I dead?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, yeah, about that…” Elrik took a breath. “In order for us to work together, you have to be dead. The living can’t see me. So, yes. I did kill you last night. But you can go back when the summer is over!”

&amp;#x200B;

“So you’re telling me that all my family and friends will think I’m dead for three months, and then I’ll just miraculously rise from the grave? And no one will question that?” I was nearly yelling at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

“I um… didn’t consider that. You’re my first intern. We’ll figure it out though! Come with me, I’ve got a lot to show you.”

&amp;#x200B;

Elrik turned and walked down the hall toward the elevator, beckoning me to follow. I was stunned, but I didn’t know what else I was supposed to do now that I was dead, so I followed him.

&amp;#x200B;

SUBREDDIT: amitheasshole, TIME: 2019-07-07 00:09:12, TITLE: AITA for confronting my friend who actively excluded me after I told her to stop being racist?, POST BODY: I've been in a friend group of about eight people for a few months now, and I'm closest with three of them. We have a group chat that's pretty active, and I've always enjoyed hanging out/talking with everyone in it.
However, even though every one in the group chat is white, they repeatedly say the n word and make racist jokes for the sake of being edgy and funny, and it makes me uncomfortable.
So one day when one of the people I'm closer with said the nword in the chat, I responded by saying it wasn't funny, it was just ignorant and racist.
One of the other people in the chat genuinely apologized and said they would stop, but the one I'm closer with just said "I'm not ignorant, just stupid". I said that wasn't an excuse, and she said she's not ignorant because she "knows the depth and meaning of the word", yet continued to use it and make racist jokes. 
After this conversation, my friends kept hanging out without inviting or telling me, and have made a new group chat without me. My best friend has asked multiple times why I'm not in it, and they simply ignore her. They've also started being rude to and excluding this same best friend because she doesn't tolerate their racist behavior either. 
So I texted the close friend and asked if there was a problem between us, since she has been ignoring me for several weeks. She didn't respond, so I sent another text saying that if this was about me calling her out, then I didn't care. And I said that if she planned on continuing to use racist language, then she shouldn't come to my family party she was invited to, because I didn't want my family thinking I hang out with ignorant people. 
She played victim and said I clearly didn't know her at all and I "constantly paint her as racist". I said that if she was so butthurt over me asking her to stop using a slur that she was willing to go out of her way to avoid me, then she clearly was not the friend I thought she was at all. And the conversation ended at that.
Am I the asshole here? I feel like all I did was stand up for myself and what I believe in, but clearly half of my friends don't feel that way., PERMALINK: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca3a24/aita_for_confronting_my_friend_who_actively/

My doctor told me it would make me feel somewhat drunk, and when I've taken it and then stayed awake I've felt a little woozy and out of it mentally. 

Discovered this subreddit, and am currently following guides I've seen. Took one pill with a fatty meal at 8, another at 830 with peanut butter and soda, and another at 9 with the same. It's now 9:40 and I'm feeling that kinda woozy feeling, but it's not much. Should I take  another pill (bringing me up from 900mg to 1200) or wait it out?

My last dose was 12 days ago. I think about it every day. I went through a week of physical withdrawals, which ended with dope sickness so bad I couldn't get out of bed for a day and a half. 

I'm trying to quit bc my boyfriend, who I've recently started dating, used to have an opiod addiction and has been really helpful through this. But I just want ops again. Everything is boring. Drinking. smoking. hanging with friends (granted I only have about 2 here besides my boyfriend). Cigs. All of it. Nothing feels enough any more.

I reached out to a girl I used to hook up with that I'm still friends with and asked her if she could get me codeine bc ik she drinks lean from time to time. She said she maybe could. I know I shouldn't have done that.

I don't want to let myself or my boyfriend down by relapsing. They keep reminding me I'm gonna have to deal with withdrawals all over again if I use, but part of me doesn't care.

I don't feel like myself 100% right now, and I keep thinking maybe if I just did ops one more time things would feel less boring. I just want that feeling of the first time I tried Dilaudid back. and I can't have it, so I don't know what to do., PERMALINK: /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/eto0gh/everything_is_boring/

I'm a 19 yr old college kid with a minor opioid problem and I feel like my problems aren't bad enough for me to go to NA. everyone there would be actual adults with real addictions and issues and I don't want to feel out of place or be judged.

That being said I was really mad at myself when I got back home. I cried a bit and then went to my boyfriend's, where I just laid on the couch and said nothing for a few hours, because I just felt like shit.

I want to get better because right now all I think about is using. I get a pretty big paycheck in a few days and I'm so tempted to spend it on pills, but I'm 24 days clean and don't want to go through this again. I know I need extra support but something about NA scares the shit out of me.

I know I'm probably being irrational but I don't feel like I'd belong in NA. Does anyone have advice for getting over that fear and just going?, PERMALINK: /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/ezd406/too_scared_to_go_to_na/

POST:
SUBREDDIT: redditorsinrecovery, TIME: 2020-02-09 17:41:40, TITLE: Starting to feel hopeless, POST BODY: I'll be 30 days clean off ops tomorrow. 

I don't want to be though.

I tried going to NA again yesterday, but everyone there was older POC- and I'm a 19 yr old white dude- and I ended up leaving the building before the meeting started because I just didn't feel like it was the right meeting for me. Before I left an older man introduced himself to me, and he ended up being on the same bus as me. He asked if I had changed my mind, I said yeah, and he said I should try meetings in other parts of the city because it might be better for me. He gave me his name and number, and the address for a meeting on Sunday (today).

I decided I'd try another meeting right after, because it was only a few extra stops on a train I was already taking. I showed up, walked inside, and when I saw there were only about three people there, I turned around and went home before anyone saw me. I tried to go to the meeting the guy told me about today, but it was in a hospital and I couldn't find it, and I didn't want to ask around about NA bc that just feels uncomfortable.

My partner insists that I go to at least one meeting. They think I need help because of how bad my cravings are. They're an ex-addict as well, so while I trust their opinion I just don't want to keep exhausting myself by travelling to these places and ending up turning tf around again.

It's really really frustrating. And a huge part of me just wants to go buy and start using again. Last night I actually tried to go withdraw cash to cop, but my check hasn't gone through yet so I couldn't.

I never wanted to quit in the first place. I just had to bc I ran out of my prescription and couldn't afford pills. but now I can. The only thing holding me back from relapsing is knowing it would upset my partner a lot. Today they told me if I relapse they're gonna make me go to NA, but for now they'll trust I can deal on my own and with my therapist.

I've just lost all motivation. I've had depression for years but this is so different. I can have a really good day. Wake up energetic, happy, even. Then the thoughts start. I think about buying a few pills. Then I think about it again and again and again. and by the end of the day it's usually all that's on my mind. I don't want to do anything bc I don't see the point. I'm just gonna be miserable until I can get my fix. and I can't get that right now. I hate this. 

I had a dream the other night I got my hands on Dilaudid somehow. Had two pills in an RX bottle. Don't remember much of the dream but when I woke up I stg I could taste the drip I would get when I sniffed that shit in the back of my throat and I haven't stopped craving it since. I just want to use.

I just needed to let out my frustrations to ppl who aren't directly involved. Thanks if you read this all, PERMALINK: /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/f1hdg3/starting_to_feel_hopeless/

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2020-06-23 12:15:41, TITLE: Casually using, POST BODY: I used to have a bad problem with hydromorphone, and my partner helped me out of it and was with me through my withdrawals. They're a recovered addict themselves so they get it.

I found tramadol a few months ago and ended up using it, and we got in a small fight, though they were more concerned than mad. More recently, I got a big supply of oxy. I told them that I used it the first time I did, and we had a similar conversation. They were scared that if I started popping oxys I'd fall right back into addiction, and possibly overdose.

I don't want to let them down or hurt them. But I've casually used oxy probably about 5 times over the course of the last month and haven't told them. We're long distance for the moment so it's easy to hide. I was planning on some point just getting rid of the supply and then coming clean to them about it, but I don't want to let it go.

Last night I did 10mg of oxy (after not doing any for over a week) after smoking a bowl and it was the most euphoric high I've ever had. Just blissful, and fun, and relaxing. It scared me. Because I am already thinking about the next time I'll do it again. And the only reason I can't use every day is I work 40 hours a week as a server, and oxy keeps me up all night if I take it after like 10pm (when i get home from work) and would make my job impossible if I showed up high.

I don't want to fall back into dependency, I'm gonna keep chipping once a week. But I don't know when or how to tell my partner. I don't like feeling like i'm lying to them, and i know it would hurt them to see me using again, and they wouldn't believe it was just casual use. 

I just needed to put my thoughts out somewhere because no one in my life knows about my drug use rn. Stay safe y'all

UPDATE: I talked it out with my partner. Flushed all the pills I had. Felt like shit after. Still have the urge to use. But do feel slightly free. Don't know how long I'll last before another fuck up but we'll see., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/heio36/casually_using/

Was clean for over four months, had a one time relapse when I found some tramadol, and then relapsed again at the beginning of this month when I got into my mom's safe and swiped a bottle of oxy. I told my partner about the initial relapse, but didn't mention that I was using once or twice a week since.

Because I was freaked out that I was so focused on my high from last night, I confessed to them that I'd been using. We had a long talk and they were very understanding, but they told me I had to flush the pills. It took me an hour of internal arguing to do it. I got so anxious about it I started getting a migraine and thought I was going to throw up.

But I did it. I flushed em. All 15 and a half pills gone.

And I immediately regretted it. I can't possibly get those pills anywhere else. They're from 2013, they don't even make those kind anymore. I'll never experience that high again. Ever.

Opiates have been my fall back for whenever my PTSD got bad. If I had a day where I was just irritable and angry, I could snort 5mg and feel that warmth and go back to being talkative and happy again. It's an easy out. I want it back already. I almost saved one just so I could have one more high, and I so wish I did. I am so angry that I just wasted all of those meds. I know in the long run I would've fallen back into a pit, but trying to cope with my trauma without that crutch is just so much harder. Pills take the weight off my shoulders and let me just relax. Weed just can't do that for me. 

I know I'm just scared of change. I don't want to stop using. I don't have any intrinsic motivation to do it. I just don't want to hurt my partner, because they were an addict themselves and they know the struggle and have helped me through withdrawals and everything. They deserve better. I just can't find a way to believe that I also deserve better. And that's why I've relapsed. And that's why I don't know how long I'll last.

But I guess I just have to take it one step at a time for now. One day clean., PERMALINK: /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/heuqnj/flushed_my_pills_today/

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2020-07-01 11:22:11, TITLE: Day Four. Feel like shit, POST BODY: Day four clean off oxy. I only used for a few days when I last relapsed so I don't have any physical withdrawals thank god. 

Everything is dull and boring. Even playing video games feels like a chore. I work every day, and I feel like a zombie on my commute and throughout my shift. I've picked up cigarettes again as a minor comfort. Don't even really have fun smoking weed. 

Only thing stopping me from picking the lock on my mom's safe and stealing a few more pills is my partner. They've been so patient and compassionate and no one has ever cared about me as much as they do and I can't keep hurting them. They told me they can't stand seeing me throwing away the inches of progress I've made again and again. I don't want to lose them. But god, how much longer can I live like a shell of a person before I break?

I had this feeling after I got through withdrawals last time I was heavily using. But I was at school, I was seeing friends regularly, I kept busy with a part time job I really liked, and my partner was there with me through most of it. And I didn't have easy access to any more pills at school, so I figured I may as well just get better. I don't remember it being this hard.

The only time I have been smiling is when I have to do my customer service facade at work, and occasionally when I talk to my partner on the phone. I'm supposed to go to a "beerlympics" party with a bunch of my coworkers next week. Initially I was really looking forward to it but right now I just want to cancel on them. I don't have the energy for that. 

Everything is moving so slow. I constantly catch myself thinking "I should just fucking kill myself" but I know I would never actually. I'm just so goddamn tired of this after only four days. How can I keep this shit up, PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hjdhk1/day_four_feel_like_shit/

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2020-07-03 21:37:28, TITLE: Had a huge scare today, POST BODY: All the pills I've used were stolen from my mom.

It started with dilaudid, which she had in the medicine cabinet, and was originally prescribed to me in late 2018 after a surgery. I used daily for about a month, and became hooked.

I relapsed on tramadol I found in a medicine cabinet in early April. It was prescribed to my dog for when she got sick in December and never used. 

My last relapse I stole oxy from my mom's safe, they're old pills from when my grandpa was alive that my mom keeps in case we ever need them (she has back issues and had to use opiates to get by for a whole summer once).

Tonight fireworks started for fourth of july. My elderly dog panicked, as per usual. My mom went looking for the tramadol to give her to maybe calm her. Of course, it wasn't there.

She started searching the whole house, confused and concerned as to where it went. I was holding my dog, wrapped in a weighted blanket and shaking violently, on my bed. At one point she yelled across the house angrily to me "you didn't take it, [my name], did you?". I didn't want to say yes and start something while my dog was panicking and my brother was right in the living room so I said no. She went and checked the safe for the tramadol, and of course, did not find it.

That whole ordeal terrified me. I know my mom would love me no matter what but her ex was addicted to opiates and that's partially why they broke up, even though I would say he was one of the best guys she's dated since my dad. This winter I was having a crisis about what to do with my major and about how bad my fall semester grades were, and how I felt like a disappointment. and while trying to comfort me she said something along the lines of "You're not a disappointment. You go to college and you're not addicted to opioids, which is more than most kids around here could say." And that was at the prime of my usage. I don't want to disappoint her. My brother is also going through a lot right now and she's trying to help him. She's already dealt with years of me being depressed, suicidal, self harming, smoking weed, doing terribly at school , and more. I'm tired of being the problem kid. She doesn't need two sons with huge issues right now.

I don't think she will press me further, but now I'm on edge. And I'm scared to take from her safe again. Which I know is technically a good thing but I like having the safety net that if everything goes to shit I can pick a lock and get a fix.

I want to use this scare as motivation to get better but right now my head is all over the place and I'm just sad that I feel like I always let my mom down, and angry at myself, and anxious about getting found out, and yet still slightly hopeful. Idk. I'm only six days clean right now (no physical wds) so my brain is still trying to readjust and shit just keeps happening to me lmao. Just needed to get this out., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hkvwrx/had_a_huge_scare_today/

Feeling that warmth and happiness start to hit right as i'm finishing getting the next line prepared. I miss feeling like that. I'm only twelve days clean. If I relapse it's gonna hurt the people I care about. But I want to do it. So bad. I know this gets easier, I was clean for like three months before I relapsed. I know it can get easier but the urge never left me and I have access to it so easily now. god. I wanna be stronger than I've been but I just want to chew a 10 and snort another and nod.

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2020-07-17 16:40:24, TITLE: No more excuses. I'm done. This is Day 0, POST BODY: I started using in December of 2019. Heavy dilaudid habit for a month. Only stopped when I ran out, January 2020 was the only time I went through physical withdrawals.

I've relapsed a handful of times since. A small dose of tramadol originally prescribed to my dog. Oxycontin stolen from my mother's safe. But what I used and when I used it doesn't matter.

This morning I woke up feeling like shit. I get irritable with my anxiety and depression sometimes, and today was one of those days. My mom woke me up to give me a list of chores, and I responded annoyed because it's my only day off this week and wanted to sleep in. And I could tell she was annoyed that I was complaining.  I went to mow the lawn and the mower battery died halfway through. It was disgustingly humid outside and I was soaked with sweat. I just felt fed up with everything that I had to deal with today, and in life in general.

So of course, my brain went straight to oxy. My mom wasn't home. I got into her safe with a nail file. I ate a 5mg pill. I don't think I even really wanted to, but I did, and then I waited. In about 30 minutes I calmed down from seething to okay. But I didn't feel happy. And I wasn't proud.

My partner texted me and I told them what happened. And they asked if I had considered doing anything else to cool my anger and anxiety besides oxy. I was about to type out some excuse about how it's too hot for me to go skating or do something physical or I didn't have time or whatever but I stopped. Because they were right.

I have slipped back into my old impulsive ways of doing things without a second thought. I am better than this. I deserve to be better than this. I am taking accountability for my own actions and I am going to commit to getting clean and staying clean. 

I lost myself this past year after being sexually assaulted while at school across the country from my home. I am still trying to find who I was when I was happy. When I felt like a person instead of a body. But I have realized I'm not going to find that person in drugs. That person never used opiates. Oxy won't bring him back. Only I can do that.

From now on I refuse to act like a victim and keep continually hurting people I care about. I have therapy on Monday, I'm going to tell my therapist about my drug problem. I haven't mentioned it because my mom has been home during my video sessions, and my last therapist told me I didn't have a problem (among many other weird/unhelpful things).

I have a few pills in my drawer that I took this morning. I snorted half a 5mg about an hour ago just because I hate the feeling of coming down off oxy, and don't want to be all groggy and annoyed while eating dinner with my mom tonight. I am slightly high and I will be honest I hate it. I want to be sober again. I'm getting rid of the pills before I go to sleep tonight. And I'm never touching them again.

Thank you to everyone who has commented on my posts/posted on this sub. Your words played a part in me waking up and realizing something has to change. I am going to change things. I want to be myself again., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ht4jmo/no_more_excuses_im_done_this_is_day_0/

SUBREDDIT: opiatesrecovery, TIME: 2020-08-08 00:27:06, TITLE: I just don't know what to do, POST BODY: I relapsed a-fucking-gain on Tuesday after two and a half weeks clean. Couldn't really tell you why other than I had easy access to oxy and felt like doing it. I have no impulse control. 

Tired of telling my partner I used again and hearing the disappointment and frustration. Tired of doing this cycle over and over. 

But also constantly feel an urge or need to use. Like I can't imagine myself not using for the rest of my life. Relapse feels inevitable, which I guess is why I don't feel that bad doing it. 

But I can't keep hurting the person I love like this. And I can't keep hurting myself like this. I feel like a piece of shit. I hate it. I hate that I ever started this back in December but truth be told it was inevitable. 

Sometimes I think about overdosing. But not in a way that I die. I've never OD'd and I guess I feel like if I did and survived then maybe that would be the kick in the ass I need to stay clean. I won't actually do it though. It's just a thought I have.

I'm just really upset with myself today. I'm lost and confused. In the past when I've relapsed my partner and I will talk for over an hour about it, sometimes arguing. Today it was just kind of silence. We've both said everything we can possibly say. But I'm still making the same mistakes. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I was driving home from work today, thinking about how I would tell them. I cried most of the drive. I hate who I've become and the shit I put myself and others through and yet I still wanna get fucking high. I don't know what to do, PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/i5tp90/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do/

I think it's one part addiction, another part mental illness, and another part PTSD anniversary effect but i feel an overwhelming sense of impending doom. There's a lot up in the air rn and I know it's gonna go wrong and i'm gonna snap. I'm having mixed emotions about not being able to move into my college rn, partially due to the fact i was sexually assaulted shortly after moving in almost exactly a year ago. My brain feels like a mess. Can't sleep much. Haven't been feeling like eating much. Sometimes I feel like i'm not fully awake. Like my brain isn't on.

I can't stop thinking about using either. I plan for it. The opportunity comes. Then I text my partner and remember why i'm trying to stay clean. And they stay up with me until i fall asleep. I'm so tired of hurting them. But I miss feeling the brain fog in a good way. I want that instant gratification of snorting oxy and feeling the high hit  that weed and cigs don't give me anymore. i'm tired., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ib5qdq/nothing_feels_right/

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2020-08-21 04:20:10, TITLE: How soon after taking opiates would you overdose?, POST BODY: My DOC is oxy, usually been 5mg Rx pills. I'm trying to get clean but keep relapsing every few weeks. Anyway, I usually chew a few pills and then snort the rest at a steady pace. Sometimes if I take even slightly more than usual I start panicking that I'm going to OD. How soon is the onset of the actual overdose (like the beginning of respiratory failure, losing consciousness, etc) after dosing intranasally? I just want to know if there is certain amount of time after dosing where, if I don't take anymore, I will know I'm "in the clear" and don't have to panic.

Sorry if this is a stupid question I don't have a lot of experience with opiates and have never OD'd or seen someone OD, and I always use alone so I'm terrified of being found dead in my bedroom by my mom bc I went a little too far.

Any help is appreciated, stay safe and happy nods :), PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/idthz5/how_soon_after_taking_opiates_would_you_overdose/

SUBREDDIT: rapecounseling, TIME: 2020-08-23 14:58:28, TITLE: It's been a year since I was raped and I feel so overwhelmed, POST BODY: I (19M) was sexually assaulted and raped my first week of college, just one week short of a year ago. I can't go back to school because of covid, and my classes are online. I've been missing college a lot but every time I think about it I also think about the assault. 

About a month ago I posted my story on twitter and name dropped my rapist. I sent the tweet to him because I wanted him to recognize what he did to me and I hoped I could maybe get closure. But no. He called me a liar. Said it wasn't rape because I didn't stop him. "If you didn't want to have sex why did you get on top?" When he had already assaulted me and told me to get on top. Tried to insinuate that I somehow assaulted him because he was drunk, even though that was part of the reason I told him upwards of ten times I did not want to have sex. He called me a liar, blamed me for my friend (his suitemate) "harassing" him the whole year. Then when I blocked him on one platform he found me on another and asked me to tell him whatever I wanted to say. Tried to get my sympathy by saying he knows what abuse feels like. He has gaslit me and my friends since it happened and it drives me fucking insane.

I have him blocked on everything. I have outed him online so other people at our school know who he is and what he did to me. But I don't feel any better. I'm still so fucking angry. I hate myself. I can't stand the thought of anyone touching me most of the time. Somedays I don't even want to be physical with my boyfriend- who I trust most in the whole world. I gained a substance abuse issue after the rape that developed into a full on opioid addiction that I am still struggling to recover from.

I feel stuck and overwhelmed right now. It's always pulling at me. I feel like I need something, be it drugs or nicotine (which I just quit as well) or literally anything and I don't know what that is. 

I'm also long distance with my partner right now because of covid and I just wish I had them here because I'm so much happier around them.

I haven't been able to speak to my therapist about it because my sessions are online and I have no privacy in my house. I just feel lost and needed to get everything off my chest because otherwise I'm gonna start crying at work., PERMALINK: /r/rapecounseling/comments/ifa15o/its_been_a_year_since_i_was_raped_and_i_feel_so/

Her compulsions were irrational and upsetting, and she was not a neat person. She was convinced she needed to blink when people said certain words to her or she would die. It bled into her being a perfectionist, and not wanting to do anything if she couldn't do it perfectly. It can be a life ruining mental illness if untreated. It has nothing to do with liking things to be neat.

SUBREDDIT: Anarchy101, TIME: 2020-09-15 12:22:04, BODY: The current "war on drugs" is what is killing addicts. If access to drugs becomes limited, people will use whatever they can get their hands on, which is often laced drugs that they end up ODing on. In an ideal anarchist society drugs would be accepted and totally legal, with spaces for people to safely use. In Denmark there are rooms people can go to to use heroin, and not a single person in them has died from overdose. If people want to quit, they should be provided the rehab and other resources they need. But you can't stop someone from using. So they should have the ability to use in a safe manner without fear of punishment.

SUBREDDIT: USC, TIME: 2020-10-09 19:42:51, BODY: the past week i had a huge assignment in every one of my classes (midterms and projects) in addition to normal assignments. was doing like 2-4 hours of work  a night for a week and a half when im only in 16 credits. and after getting it all done im just completely burnt out. might take a leave of absence next sem but if i did i would have to work full time and it's so hard to find a job rn. feels like a lose lose

also i appreciate everyone advocating for P/NP, but i bombed last year due to personal issues and my grades are doing better this semester and i need them to count towards my GPA, i just dont want to have to kill myself to keep them going well. P/NP only takes some amount of pressure off. it doesn't fix the issue yk

They're insanely backed up right now, and not scanning packages at most stops. Been waiting on a package now for two weeks and just received my first tracking update since two days after it shipped. If you're worried you can contact TWY site to make sure it shipped, and then USPS if it has shipped and you still can't get updates.

Shipping anything right now is just a waiting game, patience is key lol

SUBREDDIT: ftm, TIME: 2021-06-29 21:02:17, TITLE: Depo-Provera on T when cycle already stopped?, POST BODY: TW: menstrual cycles

I'm a trans man, been on Testosterone for 3.5 years, and haven't had my period since I started (though it was already insanely irregular before T). I've had maybe 2-3 incidences of spotting, but no real period. 

I have been in a relationship where I'm at risk of getting pregnant for a year and a half now, and have had to take Plan B a handful of times. I would like to start a form of birth control soon so I don't have to buy expensive ass Plan B, and also just don't have to worry. 

My endo has briefly mentioned my options for BC before, but I have declined out of wanting to do my own research. I'm seeing my doctor again in a month and I want to ask about birth control, but I want to know other people's experiences first.

My main fear is that my cycle will return when I start depo. I've also heard some people have mood issues on the shot, which is very worrying to me. I have anxiety, depression, and adhd; I take SNRIs and Concerta to manage my mood/brain, and I don't want anything to fuck up the careful balance I  have going on. 

Has anyone else started depo provera several years into taking T, with their period long gone? Did you have any adverse side effects? Any stories/advice are appreciated., PERMALINK: /r/ftm/comments/oan1i5/depoprovera_on_t_when_cycle_already_stopped/

SUBREDDIT: foodstamps, TIME: 2021-11-05 21:36:59, TITLE: Confused about Calfresh Approval?, POST BODY: I got approved for Calfresh 3 days ago. The approval notice online said I would be getting $104 for the month of October (since I applied mid-month), and $250 per month going forward. 

However, when I go to the "Your Benefits Information" tab on the portal, it says "No benefits for this case". The EBT card tab also says I do not have an EBT account. 

I thought my card would be sent as soon as I was approved, but the "no benefits" thing has me worried. 

Is this normal? Or should I call DPSS tomorrow? I usually avoid calling when I can because of the insane hold times., PERMALINK: /r/foodstamps/comments/qnqx6t/confused_about_calfresh_approval/
