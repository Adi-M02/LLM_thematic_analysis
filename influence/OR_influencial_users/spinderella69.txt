TITLE: Codeine question, POST BODY: I can buy 4 ounces of Codeine cough syrup in my area,it's sold OTC. Now if I were to drink all 4 ounces before my pain doctor tests me,I'm assuming I will pop positive for opiates? He does a very basic test checking for opiates and methadone. I tend to run out of my meds pretty early,so this could help me if I need it. Thanks for your response!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3kljej/codeine_question/

TITLE: Drug test question (fingernail clipping test), POST BODY: My husband is up for a job with a company that has a very strict,zero tolerance outlook on drugs and alcohol due to the type of work he will be performing. They have told him drug testing is mandatory if he is offered the job. I'm thinking that this company will probably due more then the standard UA,I'm guessing a hair follicle or finger nail test. I've tried to find information on how far back a finger nail test will go,and haven't found anything conclusive. Anyone here have an idea or experience with this type of testing?

TITLE: Another post about fucking someone off CL! It's not what you think:), POST BODY: So my husband and I have been together 13 years,and since we use meth and other stims,we have done just about everything you can imagine sexually. We have had FFM 3sums,and have wanted to have a MMF 3sum for years,but whenever we post an add on CL,we never find anyone serious,apparently tweakers are unreliable :) well last night we finally found a guy who was cool,not pushy or too gaked,and had some meth too. This is like winning the tweaker lottery. I was super nervous because my husband is the only man I have fucked for the last 13 years,but I took a ton of Adderall and snorted 5 lines of meth,and sure enough I've got 2 dicks in my mouth! Another deviant sexual experience helped along by meth. We all had fun and it was a success. Thanks meth for enriching my life! , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3wqkwi/another_post_about_fucking_someone_off_cl_its_not/

BODY: I've had all the different pharms,except opana and hydro and oxy feel very similar to me. There both very energetic and euphoric. Morphine is less energetic,slightly more sedating less euphoria. And dilaudid was much more sedating,little euphoria. I prefer hydro or oxy because I prefer the energetic feeling versus the sedating nod.

BODY: That's not true. If it contains apap it has to be on the label by law. All Rxs are required to be labeled correctly so people can avoid drug interactions or overdoses. If it has apap in it,the label will say so,it's a requirement. Your saying that all 5mg oxy,no matter if it has apap or not is just labeled"Oxycodone"? Definitely incorrect.

It will be in your file that you aren't taking the medication as prescribed,and that will make it even more difficult to get anything in the future.

BODY: APAP is just regular Tylenol. Snorting pills with apap isn't recommend for a couple different reasons,one its not good for your sinuses at all. Oxy has a pretty decent oral BA,so just take them orally. They also are not too old to take,a couple years old is nothing. Also keep in mind this is how almost all opiate addiction starts,with someone taking a couple oxy or vicodin to see what it's like,and there basically opening Pandora's box. I suggest maybe reading some of the posts on this sub to see what your future could look like before you take those pills. Good luck.

I used to sell the H to buy more crack,or just throw it away cause I just was really into crack and meth. Gotta admit that I've always been curious,but just never done it.

TITLE: Opiate test kits, POST BODY: I mentioned this briefly in another thread about possible fake pills and thought this may be useful information for a lot of you that maybe you aren't aware of. You can purchase regent test kits at dancesafe.org and test your pills/powders prior to taking them to see if they contain fentanyl. The kit will identify Codeine,Morphine,Oxycodone,and Hydrocodone. The kit costs 20$ and if your interested you want to purchase the Mecke testing kit. Stay safe everyone!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/41y4m9/opiate_test_kits/

BODY: You haven't really proven anything,although you want to act like your  the big man on campus. An obituary would be proof,but its too early for one of those. You asked for a new story,and I don't know where you live,but they don't put drug overdoses on the news in my town,and I live in a very rural area and drug overdoses are so common they aren't news worthy here,so demanding media coverage is an unreasonable request. The only proof is an obit,nothing you have done here today proves anything. Its obvious you hated nova,and you have ran with this like a bat out of hell. I barely knew Nova,but the small amount I did know about him is that he was fucked up,he claimed to be suicidal,and didn't care if he lived or died,so him ODing isn't far fetched imo.
I don't know if this is real or not,I hope it's not because any loss of life to addiction is awful. If it turns out this is all a scam,then that's really fucked up. You seem to have taken this a bit too far imo.

He flipped out one day,started screaming about random shit,grabbed a big knife and cut his hand open. I mean almost to the bone,seriously needing stitches open. I started screaming at him that he had to go,but he didn't want to leave until he finished his crack first. So he picked up my roommates filthy ass sock off the floor,duck taped the dirty sock to his seriously wounded hand,and sat back down and proceeded to finish smoking his crack like shit was totally normal. He finished his crack and left. I don't know if he went to the hospital because I refused to have anything to do with that nut job after that.

Many doctors are reluctant to prescribe opiates to younger patients. He may have you try other medications first or injections before writing you an opiate script.

Why would he then inform her after about his status,knowing the trouble he was facing if his intention was to rape he and spread the disease without her knowledge? It makes no sense. I don't think he raped her at all. Let me clarify before the down votes begin. I don't think that this guy drugged her or physically overpowered her and forced sex on her.Now if this girl was passed out drunk and he fucked her,yes that is rape  100%. I've known women who have said they were raped after having a sexual encounter that they regretted for whatever reason. I know a woman who fucked her ex that she had a kid with,and then walked into a hospital and said he raped her because she was pissed over child support. He got 2 years. Woman do make false allegations. It happens more than people are aware. I'm not defending this guy,what he did was WRONG. But we were not there,we don't know all the details. I hate what this guy did,he needs to pay the consequences. But he needs to pay the consequences for what he actually did. I  hate women who claim rape just because.

BODY: If you don't have a test kit the safest thing is too weigh out a couple milligrams so a scale is necessary and do an allergy test. Eat the couple milligrams and wait at least an hour. This is the safest way to rule out that you received a mistake chemical that is active at very small doses. If your using RCs you should really buy a test kit so you can test and make sure what you received tests correctly.

BODY: Never did. Had tons of offers from my dealers when I was heavy into my cocaine addiction. I was 19,and pretty attractive by most peoples standards.  I had one dealer offer me a quarter ounce to have a 3sum with him and his girl. I did consider it for a minute but just couldn't. I do believe if I had gotten any deeper into that addiction I probably would have ended up stripping or prostituting. It's good I got out when I did. I've known a lot women who are"dancers" or prostitute themselves for there addiction. I don't judge,you do what you have to do. It's a easy trap for female addicts to fall into.

You need to get help,either going to rehab or checking yourself into the hospital and tell them your suicidal. Nothing is worth your life.

Life is fucking hard. But it's also what you make it. You can get through this if you choose to.

And as cliche as it sounds,time does help heal. And please don't think I am totally" fixed". I still struggle with depression and ptsd. I do still occasionally use. What really turned my life around was becoming a parent. Being responsible,and knowing that someone's life is dependent on me trying my damndest to keep it together and be the best person / parent I can possibly be. But what worked for me isn't necessarily going to be what works for anyone else. You need to get clean,you aren't able to see things clearly. Get clean for awhile that's the most important thing right now and go from there.

BODY: Personally I think you should just get some lope and cold turkey it. A Norco addiction/withdrawal isn't going to be as intense as a oxy or heroin addiction. Lope should help enough for it to really be bearable. You definitely don't want to go to your doctor and admit that you've been abusing anything. And I think going to a sub doctor seems to be a bit extreme. At least try with the lope first.

TITLE: My doctor is pulling my scripts,would like some advice please!, POST BODY: Hey,well I went to pick up my Norco script just now,and there was a letter with my script saying due to the new guidelines,my doctor will be weaning me off my script over the next couple months. I am scripted Norcos 7.5 3 times a day,and I also occasionally get morphine 30mg ER if I complain quite a bit. I have been getting these scripts for 10 years from my doctor. My tolerance has gone up quite a bit,and I do take about 7-9 Norcos a day,I do catch a buzz still at that dose. To just manage my pain I need 15-30mg. I do have valid pain issues,backed up by MRIs and shit.
My question is,would a suboxone doctor be willing to prescribe me subs for my pain? Or are they only prescribed for addiction? I really don't want to go to a sub doctor and lie and say I am physically dependent,because I am not. I am psychologically dependent though. And would subs provide adequate pain relief or are they really only good for getting off opiates? I'm really pissed off about this,all these new guidelines are just making getting it impossible for pain management patients. Thanks for any insight that you can offer!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4az0za/my_doctor_is_pulling_my_scriptswould_like_some/

BODY: I don't take them as prescribed,my script usually lasts about a week. So when I run out I don't really have any physical withdrawal. My doctor hasn't been willing to ever increase my dose over the last 10 years because I am pretty young,I am in my late 30s,so I started taking them in my late 20s.

BODY: A lot of people use a secondary account or a "throwaway" account for posting here. If your going to be discussing your drug use or any illegal activity you may not want to use an account where someone can tie it back to you. There has also been instances where people have actually found out other members identities through the things they have posted and attempted to blackmail them or even contact there employers and told them they used drugs to just fuck up there lives for whatever reason. So I would suggest you use a secondary account and to be careful about what you post. I think new people are generally welcome here,as long as your not shit posting or are a total dumbass.

BODY: I have a little experience with meth lol. How much did you do? And how many times have you done meth before this? You said your sure its meth because of the taste? Didn't it look like meth? It sounds like your just having a bad come down. Have you been eating,drinking and sleeping? Those are the most important things to do after using to help you start feeling normal again. The cold hands and feet are likely from vasoconstriction which is common with meth. Try taking an aspirin or two,that helps a lot of people. Coming down from meth usually isn't fun especially if your not used to it. The more times you come down the more you get used to it,and it gets way easier. Obviously I'm not a doctor or anything,and if your not better or get worse go get checked out

My husband works crazy long hours during the week,and we really don't see each other during the week,weekends are the only time we spend together. I also love my kids so much,and the weekends are the only time we can spend any time together too. They are busy during the week with school and all there activities. Yesterday we had " kids choice day". My husband and I each take one of our kids out for lunch,and to do any activity they choose. Gives us a chance to spend some 1 on 1 with them and to give them our undivided attention. Now I gotta spend all week missing my kids and husband and looking forward to the weekend again.

BODY: Not being able to sleep and having dreams like that is pretty common when your on opiates. Nausea is also common and once you start to develop a tolerance it generally subsidies. 100mg of Teamadol isn't a high dose. I would just leave the opiates alone if I were you. Your opening yourself up to possibly becoming addicted. Most people are just like you and start out taking pain pills for "recreational purposes". Fast forward a couple years later and your severely addicted. Just walk away now while you can. It's not worth the risk.

BODY: That's not really tapering. So your up to 100mg of hydro a day,and your going to switch over to 60mg of oxy a day. 60mg of is about the equivalent of 100mg of hydro,so this imo isn't going to do anything to improve your Norco withdrawal. Oxy is 1 and a half times stronger than hydro. So your just prolonging the inevitable imo.

BODY: First off let me warn you about how addictive opiates are. They are the most addictive drug in the world. A lot of the heroin addicts here started out taking pain pills recreationally. This is an extremely slippery slope that your starting on. With that being said if you have no tolerance I would start out with about 30mg and see how you feel. Opiates can make you very nauseous and itchy,codeine especially. You could try taking a Benadryl with it to help with the itching. If you don't feel anything after an hour try another 15-30mg.

BODY: I wish you would take the time to read some of the posts from the addicts on here and see what opiate addiction really is like before you take the hydros. A lot of the addicts here started out taking pills recreationally. Your starting down a slippery slope and I hope you understand that. With that being said,1,000 mg of apap is the equivalent of 2 extra strength Tylenol,and its perfectly fine to take with ibuprofen. You said that you are prone to nausea,so I would start out with 5-10mg of hydro to start if you are completely opiate naive. Anymore than that may cause you nausea and vomiting. Good luck

BODY: No almost all RCs do fall under it. I'm not talking about just opiate RCs.  The analogue act covers all drugs that are analogues of schedule 1 or Schedule 2 drugs. That covers most of the amphetamines,opiates,and most of the tryptamines and psychs. And since UPS got into huge trouble for transportation of drugs,they have been extremely more vigilant in what they are doing. I would prefer to use a company that just can't open my package without a warrant. That's my preference. Do whatever you want. Enjoy your package
Edit here is just a small part of the analogue act that I copy and pasted that briefly explains it
The Federal Analogue Act, 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 813, is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act passed in 1986 which allowed any chemical "substantially similar" to a controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II to be treated as if it were also listed in those schedules

BODY: You haven't been using enough to develop any tolerance or withdrawal. The craving to use more is the nature of the beast with opiates. Opiates feel great, and when they start to wear off you want to take more. Don't take anymore and ride it out. You will likely feel different tomorrow

BODY: You should just flush it or give it away. Your playing with fire by trying that dope. Your dealer gave you that taste for a reason, cause he knows once you try it, you will be back. It's extremely dangerous to just use H with no tolerance or experience with opiates. That dope could be cut with fentanyl, and could easily kill you. Just don't buddy. But if your dead set on trying it, do a tiny bump the size of a match head. Wait 20-30 mins and do another one if your not feeling it. Continue doing this until you are high. Also I definitely would have someone there in case you OD. Good luck

BODY: OK get an empty pop can that's fairly dry inside. Your going to smoke from the hole that you drink from. You need to take like screw driver and punch a hole in the he side of the can twords the bottom and that will be your carb. Then on another side of the can that dosent have the carb,make a small dent twords the bottom of the can with your thumb,then take a needle or safety pin and use it to punch about 15 holes in the indent you made. You obviously need to hold the can vertically in front of you like a pipe rather than up and down like when you drink out of it. Then take ashes from a cigarette and place a large pile over all the holes you punched. These will work as a filter. Then place your rock on the ashes and smoke,sucking through the drinking and using your finger or thumb to cover and work the carb. It sounds kind of complicated but it's very simple. It's just very hard to describe to someone rather than just show them. I hope you can figure it out. Good luck!

Since my husband started his current job,which happens to be the best job of his career, his interest in sex has become almost non existent. And he no longer has any interest in us getting all stimmed up anymore and having our fun nights when we have the opportunity. He claims he is too tired for sex,and he's too concerned getting high will interfere with his job. I'm finding it hard to understand, since we have been married for a long ass time, and this has been part of our life throughout our entire relationship. I'm starting to believe something else is going on like he's cheating. Needless to say I have been masturbating a lot.

Most tweakers take breaks after 6 day binges, your body pretty much requires that you do. Once you start using H your gonna be fucked. It's nothing like stims,it's nothing like hydrocodone,it's a whole new level of hell. Good luck

BODY: When I say manipulate, I don't necessarily mean manipulating people to give you money for drugs,or rides to get them. You say that only two people knew of your use. Did you lie to people about certain things to keep your use under wraps? Did anyone ever call you when you were on your way to cop and ask you what your doing, what was up and you omitted the fact that you were on the way to your dealer? We're you ever late to work because your use interfered in some way and you made up an excuse? Those are just examples of manipulation. Lies and lies by omission are forms of manipulation.

BODY: If you don't want to become a habitual user then you should not experiment with opiates. All of the addicts here started off using recreationally, and all thought that they had enough willpower, or they were too smart,or that they were just above becoming an addict. If you think your depressed now,wait until you are an addict. If you insist on tempting fate, then get yourself some hydrocodone and take about 10mg to start. But let me warn you,if your ordering off the DNM there is a very good chance that you could end up with fake pills that are just made with fentanyl. And with your lack of tolerance, that would likely kill you. Dont tempt fate, just stick to psychedelics, don't potentially ruin your life

can be confirmed with x-rays,CT,or MRI. Then the doctor may start you off on antidepressants, anti inflammatorys, or lyrica. If those don't work, then you may get a script for opiates. They will drug test you regularly, and if you fail you will probably be dropped. And they may also require you to do pill counts.

BODY: I always look in the casual encounters section and people use different code and slang for certain drugs. Meth is spin,spun,parTy, tweak. Coke is sking, snow,snow white. Weed is obviously 420. Opiates are percs,roofing tar,30 inch blue jeans. And also look for adds that just talk about party favors, they could mean many different kind of drugs. Before meeting anyone off CL I always reverse lookup the cell phone number they give me just to see if about weird pops up. Don't let your money walk either. If yes don't see any adds with what your looking for you can always post your own.

The corner boys are out there to make money they aren't going to do anything that will attract the police that's very bad for business. Not to be a bitch but you've obviously led a very sheltered life if you believe that all guys in poor neighborhoods are just dying to rape you.

Between bars and all the online dating service nowadays, if you want a dick your going to find one for free regardless if your unattractive, married, whatever. And if by the off chance a woman was going to pay,its because your smoking hot or well hung. Most women can find a decent looking guy with an average size cock to fuck for free no problem. I'm a woman BTW.

TITLE: Fucking ridiculous, POST BODY: Some of you may remember me posting about how my doctor pulled my pain scripts after being in pain management with him for the last ten years due to the new CDC guidelines. Well I went yesterday to see the doctor for an unrelated issue and he asked about my pain,told him it's pretty bad. He once again said that the CDC has said that doctors are over prescribing opiates, getting people addicted,blah blah blah. But what I found to be totally ironic is I walked out of his office with a prescription for adderall and a script for Ritalin. Guess it's OK to hand out amphetamine scripts still. Don't get me wrong, i love my amps but doctors can prescribe them no problem and have millions of Americans taking them for there "ADHD" and that's totally acceptable, but God forbid I get a fucking norco script.

I never had my dose increased or asked for it to be, events though my tolerance obviously had gone way up over the years.

I did take more than I was supposed to for my pain and it did give me a little buzz,but I definitely wasn't nodded out.

TITLE: Junkie Jesus breaks my heart, POST BODY: So Ive been sick all weekend, genuinely sick, not dope sick or coming down. I was laying on the couch watching TV, when a suburban with a booming system pulls into my driveway. I watch out my window and two shady looking Mexicans get out of the car and switch spots, the driver gets in the passenger seat and the passenger gets in the driver seat. One of them also drops what looks like a small black bag on the ground in my driveway. Now I live in an extremely rural area of the Midwest, so seeing this is go on in these parts is very rare. Im excited now, thinking these guys are paranoid about something, and decided to ditch it in my nice rural driveway. In my area meth is king and pills are too, so Im thinking its something good, that will hopefully help me with this awful flu. I wait patiently until they pull out of my driveway, and run outside to investigate the contents of the "black bag". It isn't a black bag, it is a black sock, and unfortuneately the sock is totally empty :| I sadly go back in my house, curl up on the couch, and curse JJ for getting my hopes up. Hope everyone else is having a better weekend then me :(, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/56nmip/junkie_jesus_breaks_my_heart/

TITLE: Im u/spinderella69 AMA!, POST BODY: So this morning u/Prettyeyesforasnake suggested I do an AMA, and I said I don't think Im interesting enough to do an AMA, but she said I should, and she would like to see more members here do an AMA because she thinks it would be a great way for us to get to know each other better, and after she said that, I thought that would be a really cool idea. Id love to get to know peeps better, and have people get to know me. So here we go. A little bit about me, if you don't know me. Im in my late 30s, female, married for a long time, kids, and a stay at home mom. Ive been a poly-substance drug user since I was 15. My DOC is meth, and or most stimulants, with Oxy and Hydro being my DOC opiate. There are a couple subs that I mod in my profile that will give you some insight of what I am into drug wise I guess lol. One of my favorite drug activities is getting spun and having raunchy sex sessions with my husband, and occasional others we add to the mix. Im down to answer anything, except anything that could identify me obviously. Im not easy to offend. So go ahead, AMA. And I'd really enjoy seeing other members who are comfortable sharing do an AMA here as well, Id like to see us all get to know each other better ;), PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5bbvno/im_uspinderella69_ama/

BODY: I guess it depends on how much you want to rock the boat with your parents, and how badly you want out of there house. I don't understand your finances or assets, but I would ask that whatever is going on with them that your father controls, be turned over to you or cleared up immediately, so you can get a job, or spend it however you see fit. Having the necessary means to move out is the number one priority. 

Your medication is not something they should dole out to you, although I understand why you have allowed them to do so up to this point. Don't allow them to do that. Tell them they make you feel like shit every time you ask for your medication, and since they do that, you will be controlling your pills from here on out. 

I know you may feel you owe them because of what they have done for you up to this point, but they are your parents and they love you, and you've had a ton of health problems. Most good parents would want to help there kids during a period like that, and wouldn't expect anything in return, and would want to see there kids get better, move back out of the house and become independent again. Don't feel guilty about acting like the adult you are. I know shits tough, but you can get this situation under control, but doing so means voicing your opinion forcefully, and making waves. There still gonna love you when it's all said and done though. Hang in there

BODY: Its your money, its not really my business, but you guys don't really need 2 2DS, a tablet, and a laptop. If you have decent smart phones, you should be able to do almost everything you need to do on them. Giving hundreds of dollars to other people isn't bettering your situation in any way, it's bettering there situation. You have a new baby, that 300$ could have bought a lot of diapers and necessities for it. Its your life fam, do what you want, Im just saying you made a post the other day where it didn't sound like you guys were doing that great, all Im saying is just be honest with yourself and look at the big picture. Your a father dude, I hope your kicking some of that money to the support of your new baby, and supporting yourselves in the most prudent way possible. Let the downvotes begin.

BODY: Yes, it could definitely kill you if you were to take too much. Fent is really only for opiate tolerant people, and while 90mg of oxy a day is a medium tolerance, you could still OD on fent if you take too much. You need to find out if it is the gel patch or not. If it is the gel patch, you can cut the corner off and squeeze a TINY amount onto foil and smoke it. If it is not the gel kind you can cut the patch into quarters or even sixths and gum the pieces. Do not chew gum the whole patch, that would be wayyy to much for someone with a tolerance like yours.

Honestly with your tolerance, I wouldn't fuck with it and just try and trade it for some Oxy. A fent high is much different from an oxy high, and not nearly as enjoyable imo.

BODY: That isn't the norm though dude, those are the worst case scenarios, hence why they end up on youtube. APVP is some potent ass shit, but it dosent normally send people into rages or make them face eaters. Ive done 100's of grams of APVP and the most common negative side effect is paranoia. And APVP isn't nearly as common now since it was scheduled. You can still find it on some DNM, or if you happen to know certain Chinese vendors, but it's not as easy to come by as it was a few years ago. Dude could have just been legit mentally ill, who knows.

BODY: Not even close actually. Its intensely euphoric, insane energy, causes a ton of horniness. But it's also extremely fiendish, compulsive redosing is the norm, and it's pretty infamous for causing psychosis if you do too much which is almost impossible to control for many. I don't recommend it unless your an extremely experienced stim user. It is my favorite drug by far, but for many people the paranoia can be too much.

It also comes with disadvantages too, like the constant propositioning for sex, the remarks, the unwanted touching etc. Deff different for female users in the game, I think if your not super streetwise and outspoken, your gonna get used up and taken advantage of all the time by the dboys, and the male addicts/boyfriends you may come across. Not saying all male users are predators, but there are some guys who will definitely try and manipulate you into doing shit you might not want to do.

Im trying to stay clean, and not use, so Im willing to explore other options. I do have chronic pain, but I also abuse my pain medication, so if I can manage it without opiates, that's preferable for me at this point.

BODY: Of course opiates are great for treating mental health issues. But they don't fix the underlying problem. They make you high, which makes you feel good. And then of course your tolerance would rise consistently with daily use, and eventually you would need huge amounts to receive desired effects. They aren't a practical treatment for mental health issues. They mask the symptoms because your high.

Tell him to lay of the Adderall, that should do the trick.

You might make her so angry that you narc'd on her, even if you haven't had sex, she could certainly say you did, and you'll be in some deep do-do.  I understand you care about her, but there really isn't anything you can do outside of telling on her, and that might not be the smartest choice for you.

BODY: She's not "doing this to you" she's an addict, and for you to take this as a personal affront is ridiculous. You knew she was an addict when you started dating, and unfortunately relapses happen, and the possibility of relapse is always possible when your involved with someone who is dealing with addiction. Calling her sister and telling her family isn't the right thing to do, it's definitely not your place. Talk to her, ask he if she wants to get clean or continue using. If she wants to try and get clean then it's up to you if you want to stay with her while she does, but you need to be aware that you cant be some controlling dude snooping through her phone and purse and shit. That's not cool at all. Trust will have to earned again, but going through her private stuff isn't OK. If she dosent want to stop using, I suggest you leave. I actually suggest you leave either way, if she get's clean again and seems legit you can always revisit the relationship, it dosent sound like you have a good enough understanding of addiction and how to works to be with someone who is struggling with recovery.

BODY: If your opiate na√Øve the last drugs you should be considering are fentanyl or U4. Both of them will kill you if you dose incorrectly. Fentanyl needs to be dosed in micrograms, that's how potent and dangerous it is. And U4 is an untested research chemical that is extremely caustic and destroys your mucus membranes with any kind of prolonged use. If you insist on trying opiates get some kratom or hydrocodone. I highly suggest you don't fuck with opiates at all. Look through this sub and see what your future will look like if you happen to be one of the people who fall in love with the opiate high.

And asking to pay a girl for a BJ or sex does not equate with sexual assault. Ive been sexually assaulted I should know. Sex work no matter if you approve or not is the oldest profession there is, and many men and woman sex workers see it no different then any other job. Many of them aren't victims, the do sex work to support themselves. The men and woman who pay for there services don't deserve to be hustled and blackmailed by you, or anyone else.

BODY: I was addicted to crack, and at the end of my addiction was smoking a quarter ounce a day and having grand mal seizures regularly from it. My neurologist told me that if I didn't stop, I was certainly going to die, that this wasn't a scare tactic or him blowing smoke up my ass, those were his exact words. I left that appointment and smoked crack. I did stop not long after that, and haven't used coke/crack since. Its extremely mentally addictive, and the high is awesome. Too awesome

BODY: Quitting crack and other stimulants isn't as easy as smoking a bowl of weed. The mental dependency is fierce, and when you stop, the depression and cravings are intense, so intense for some that you cant function and feel suicidal. The depression and lethargy can last months and months, while your brain struggles to start producing serotonin and dopamine on it's own again. Stim withdrawl can be soul crushing.

It wasn't fun, but Adderall or something similar would just prolong the inevitable.

Bupe really isn't meant for recreational use, it's a maintenance medication. Taking too much will make you extremely sick and uncomfortable like you experienced.

BODY: It isn't selfish at all to want a boyfriend who has a job, who is self sufficient, and has goals. It floors me that you think it's selfish to want this. I'd break up with him, maybe if he gets it together you can revisit a relationship down the road. Besides the fact that he is an addict, he does not work, he does not have a car, he lives with his parents and he is 30 years old. What kind of future do you think your going to have with this guy? Move on girl.

If there being secretly taped, that's different of course. A lot of men and woman do sex work, or trade sex for drugs. Some people have different views on sex, and consider sex just an act or performance in some situations.

He treats her like shit according to her, lost his job, and yet she's supposed to allow him to continue to live in her home, and enable his addiction?

The fact that you think he wont die because he has a roof over his head is laughable, he can OD and die just as easily under her roof as he could on the streets, maybe even more so. Maybe if he actually had to live on the streets, or actually support himself and didn't have her, he would be forced to revaluate his life, and get his shit together. The logic you want her to use to guide her decisions is flawed in multiple ways.

Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the primary psychoactive chemicals in kratom so I would classify is as an opioid, but I'm not sure there's a consensus on how to classify the plant. I see things differently then you, so I guess we can just disagree and leave it at that.

Do you have a legit diagnosis? If you don't, then I wouldn't expect to get a script for opiates. Going to a pain management doctor is a good idea, hopefully they can figure out the cause of your pain, and help you. Until then you could look into using kratom, and see if that helps your pain. r/kratom is a very helpful sub

Im not trying flex anything, or show colors. We stopped endorsing the TC room because we had received many complaints, and you were made aware of this when we stopped endorsing it, I distinctly remember the comments you made. This isn't something Ive just decided to pull out of my ass to "show my colors". This is a decision the mod team made weeks ago, and you are aware of that. We told you then because a r/o mod dosent mod the room that we could no longer be affiliated with it, and your reply was that was fine, you didn't want one of us involved in modding the room, so the fact you act like this is a big surprise, and Im on some type of power trip here confuses the hell out of me.

I wouldn't mess with potentiators if you have no tolerance. If you want to take the oxy, 10-15mgs of oxy is a good starting dose as well.

BODY: It's hard to tell whats caused your mom to use or be "broken" but Im betting it's some kind of childhood trauma or abuse/molestation. Perhaps she does have some form of mental illness that she's been self medicating all these years. Regardless of why, if she has been a good mother, a loving mother, a supportive mother, then be grateful for that at least. Have you ever talked to her about it? Expressed your love and concern? It likely wont do anything to stop her addiction, but it might feel good for you to be able to express your feelings, and get some things off your chest. She wont stop unless she wants to, and at this point, it sounds like she's been using most her life, so it's likely she wont stop now. But you can love her, regardless if she's an addict or not.

Take a small wire. like a piece of coat hanger, or even a very thin screw driver, and push the brillo on the end of the pipe to the other end of the pipe and hit it. Pushing it from end of the pipe to the other scrapes all the resin that's stuck to the inside of the pipe. Doing that is called smoking the "push". Depending how much has been  smoked put of the pipe, you should be able to get a few good "pushes". But Im betting this dude smoked all the resin that was in the pipe before he gave it to you, so don't expect much

I was in PM for 10 years with my GP, I signed a contract, did random urine tests, all that shit. I never asked for an increase in my hydro script in 10 years because I didn't want to rock the boat. My doctor dropped me a year ago and weaned me off my meds because of the new CDC guidelines. He referred me to a PM doctor, who does injections and shit. Im actually going to see him next week to try injections again. Apparently this PM doctor dosent prescribe narcotics. Lucky me. At this point, I would be satisfied if the injections helped, and I could go without the scripts, but the injections have never helped in the past, so I guess I'll see.

BODY: Actually getting MDA is pretty uncommon. If your planning on using MDMA you should get a testing kit and test it. There is a ton of RC's out there that get sold as MDMA or molly. Actual MDMA isn't really that dangerous if used infrequently. Here's the wiki link on it

BODY: I have similar issues, I have 5 herniated discs. I started pain management in my late 20s, and when your that young your not going to find a lot of doctors willing to script you opiates. Have you had any injections? Have you tried physical therapy? Have you tried any non-narcotic medications? Those are all things that you should consider if you haven't to treat your pain. You could also ask to go to a pain management doctor, who will likely have you try some of those things. Doctors aren't going to start writing you opiate scripts at 21 without exhausting all other options. Good luck

BODY: Agreed. Im a woman, who was sexually abused as a child, and raped and assaulted as an adult. You sound incredibly na√Øve, it sounds like you were taking advantage of this guy for drugs, rides, etc. You admittedly don't care for him, or find him attractive, so don't use the guy then for your benefit. Of course he expected something in return, in this game, nothing is free, especially from sketchy drug dealing guys. As a woman, who has also manipulated men in the past to benefit myself, doing this can certainly bite you in the ass. You didn't deserve to be raped or assaulted in any way, but the fact that your surprised that this guy tried to fuck you floors me. Why did you think this guy was going out of his way to help, for nothing in return? 

Edit I personally don't think this guy even attempted to rape you. You were at his house, asleep in his bed, and he tried to initiate sex with you. He stopped after you protested and said no. I personally don't consider that rape, although others are probably going to disagree

BODY: Unless you've been seriously drugged, with some kind of potent date rape drug, it's very rare to sleep through sex as a woman. I have fallen out after being up for a week, and still woke up to my alarm clock, or my husband touching me or waking me up. Ive taken huge amounts of landing gear/benzos/Seroquel and still woken up to my husband talking to me or touching me. I think most woman here will admit, it's very RARE to sleep through  sex.

OP said she regularly cuddles with this guy, she was asleep in his bed at his house, who's to say this guy wasn't just trying to initiate sex? Why is it assumed he was trying to rape her? I have touched my husband multiple times while he was sleeping trying to wake him up to fuck, and vice versa, dosent mean he was trying to rape me. Who knows what they guy was thinking, the signals he was receiving certainly weren't clear, that's for sure. I don't condone sexual assault at all obviously, but OP definitely wasn't setting clear boundaries with the guy, so how was he to know exactly what she wanted? He stopped as soon as she told him not too, to me this wasn't a case of attempted rape, this was miscommunication

It is also schedule 1 in the USA, which probably wouldn't good for OP since he's in drug court. It also isn't a very functional stimulant, it's intensely euphoric, more of a party drug, and better suited for partying and sex.

BODY: So your pissed because your doctor gave you a medication to treat your pain? You do realize many people can take opiates without becoming addicted? And there are the folks, like us, where opiates just scratch that itch for us, and we become addicted. How was your doctor to know you are one of those people? I cant believe that you were totally unaware of the potential for addiction with opiates. Even if your doctor didn't explicitly warn you, it's clearly stated in the information the pharmacy provides. Blaming your doctor is a lot easier then blaming yourself. I have chronic pain, I was in PM for 10 years, so Im not unsympathetic to pain patients, but I knew real quick, like many of us do, that the pills did more then just help my pain, they made everything better. I didn't stop getting the pills though when I realized it, and neither did you. I didn't tell my doctor, and neither did you. I kept going back, and so did you. We cant blame everyone dude for our choices, although it's always easier to do so. Im not cold, I just believe in being real.

Crush the pills into a fine powder, and add just enough water to be able to fully the dissolve the pills. Load it into the oral syringe, and insert it into your asshole a couple inches. It really shouldn't hurt. Lay on your side, stomach for about 10-15 minutes until your body starts to absorb the fluid. Its really not as bad as people make it out to be, and it is one of the best ROA's for most drugs.

BODY: There is generally at least one of us on at any given time. My availability for modding is generally 7am-4pm. After my husband and kids get home from school, I don't spend as much time on the PC, but still check in regularly throughout the night. We currently have 4 active mods. If you see something that requires our attention, report the post or page us directly to it by doing u/spinderella69, u/fashionablyfake, etc. Reporting a post is anonymous, we have no idea who reports a post, it just shows it was reported. We really need your guys help in keeping content that is against the rules off this sub, the rules are in place to protect the sub, and keep it up and running, so please don't consider it "snitching". There is some coordination between us with our schedules and availability, but obviously, there will be times when someone isn't modding, so reporting posts helps us keep content that is harmful off the sub.

Im sure he's frustrated that your still using, even though it's just occasional use. I'd be frustrated if I went to rehab to get my shit together, and my husband was still getting high. Im sure he's worried he's going to get out, your going to still be using, and he's going to end up using again too, and his efforts to get clean will be in vain. Did you tell him you were going to get clean too while he was in rehab? If you did, then you either need to stop using, or cut him loose if your not going to stop. And it dosent really sound like you want to stop yet. Maybe do some soul searching, and figure out if your truly ready for sobriety. If your not, then tell him.

Nice house, couple cars, toys, etc. I don't judge people on their choice of drugs, I judge em on what kind of person they are. At the end of the day, all of us tweakers, crack heads, and junkies have more in common then we think. We all just want to get high, lead our lives, and be reasonably happy. Were not that different from each other, regardless what drug flows through our veins :)

BODY: I know, as nice as it is to put a face to a screen name, posting face pics is such a bad idea. I notice most of the selfies are posted by the younger members. The younger generation of users have basically grown up with technology and social media, and posting status updates and selfies are just part of life to them. I don't think they realize the ramifications that can come from posting pics of yourself on a site like this. People have gotten doxxed on this sub. People have attempted to blackmail members, some members had people call their jobs and tell them about their drug use. I strongly advise everyone to think before you post up face pics, or personal information, it's not as harmless as you all think it is.

I spend my days doing housework, laundry, running errands, grocery shopping. I also take care of our pets, make dinner, pack lunches, and in between doing those things I do a part time work from home gig on Amazon. I'm not currently using anything except for my Adderall script, so drugs don't play any role in my day to day life right now. I really enjoy being a SAHM and am grateful that our financial situation is good enough that I don't have to work and have been able to spend so much time with my children.

BODY: That's not how it really works. Guys who buy panties generally don't want panties covered in piss, they want panties that girls have been worn that smell like pussy. And they only want to buy them from a female in person. There not going to buy them from a guy who is selling his "girlfriends" panties. You usually have to spend a lot of time weeding through responses from guys who aren't serious about buying them before you will find a real interested buyer. And you usually can get about 50$ a pair if your a really attractive female. So this suggestion is only a viable option for a real female who is somewhat attractive, willing to meet in public to make the exchange, and willing to invest the time in finding a real buyer.

BODY: Its very dependent on your metabolism, how much you use, how often you use. But if they are only doing a regular 5 panel drug test, it wouldn't show up anyway. Ritalin is a phenethylamine, it is a stimulant but not in the amphetamine class, so it "should" not show up as an amphetamine. Now I know it does occasionally show up as a false positive as an amphetamine, but generally, it should not show and it's not supposed to trigger a positive for amps.

BODY: My doctor dropped after 10 years last year after the CDC made the new guidelines. It sucks, but all you can do is look for another doctor ASAP. Good luck though, with all the new guidelines and scrutiny that doctors are getting now, it's almost impossible to find doctors willing to treat a patients pain. The government thinks it's helping curtail the "opiate epidemic" by doing this, but really they are making it worse by pushing chronic pain patients to the black market and heroin. Shits fucked.

BODY: My husband and I have been together 15+ years. We've gone through a ton of up's and down's, some drug related but most of them not. Lately though, Ive been extremely unhappy, and am actually thinking about filing for divorce. Relationships are hard enough without adding drugs and addiction to the mix, when you add those things they are much destined to fail.

BODY: Ha you should know by now nothings to nosey for me, I'll talk about anything. Ive never used H, Ive only used pills, and of course stimulants and assorted other drugs. Ive never injected anything, Ive always been curious, but I know once I cross that line, it will be game over for me, and since I have kids who rely on me every day, I cant allow myself to do that. At different points in my life, I have definitely been in "active" addiction with stimulants, and pills, and I always will consider myself and addict, even when Im clean, like I am right now. Im sure a lot of people think it's fucked that I mod an opiate sub, when I haven't done the biggest opiate of all, but I feel like I can relate to everyone here just as much as I can relate to the members at r/stims. I know what it's like to be an addict, and I know the pain and bullshit that goes along with it, it's relatable, it's universal :) And girl, you can always ask me anything, you don't need to worry about offending me one bit.

BODY: A lot of people don't get high off of tramadol. Im one of them, it dosent do jack shit for me, and I have a tiny tolerance. It also has SSI properties to it, which a lot of people don't want, and then there's the fact that it can cause seizures. If your one of the people who can get high off of it, then I guess it's a viable option, but like I said, many people just don't get high from it.

It's really hard to walk away from someone you have spent so many years with, have beautiful children with, and have gone through so much with. We've done counseling, it dosent seem to help at all. Im not surprised, we are both broken people when it comes down to it, we were before the marriage, and we still are. It's irrational to think two incredibly fucked up individuals can lead a non fucked up life. I will always love him, but Im unwilling to spend the rest of my life looking like a fool, and not getting my needs met. Im glad you guys are working on it Tracey, when I walk away, I want to be able to know that I did everything I could, and that there wasn't any chances it was going to ever get better. Im pretty much there. Shit sucks, but Im strong, I'll figure it out.

BODY: Prices and quantities vary city by city, and state by state, so what one person pays is going to be completely different then what someone else pays. As far as how much you should do, you should start with a TINY amount, no bigger then a match head. Wait and see how you feel, and pray that it isn't cut with fent, because your tolerance is really small. You can do more TINY bumps until you reach the desired effects. I hope you've really thought this through, this is a ridiculously poor choice, especially now considering how much dope is laced with fent and carfent. Good luck, and keep some narcan on hand.

BODY: Everyone wants to believe abuse isn't an issue, but it is. Heroin is going to be cheaper and last longer, at least in the beginning, until you jack your tolerance up, so your probably going to use more, and by the time it becomes too expensive and unmanageable your fucked. If you want to save money, you could try taking a T break, I know it's easier said then done, or try kratom, you have a small tolerance, it might scratch that itch for you, without absolutely fucking up your life.

BODY: Whats your diagnosis? Do you have test results and imaging that prove you have a valid problem? If you don't have anything to back up your claims, then be prepared to have to go get MRI/CAT scans, or other tests to prove that you have something wrong with you. Your age is also going to make a big difference. How old are you? If your under 35, your going to have a harder time getting scripted opiates for the long term. Don't go in there and say you have a high tolerance, and your current dose isn't working, and you need stronger drugs. That will just make you look like a drug seeker. You need to go in there, tell them about your pain and ask them what they suggest. Always let them make suggestions and lead the conversation. They may want you to try other forms of pain management besides narcotics, like PT, Injections, non-narcotic medications before they increase your dose if you haven't tried any of those things before. Pain management doctors aren't easy to fool, they see drug seekers every day.

BODY: Regardless if the girl is high on opiates or not, you should not just assume you can "bang her ass out". A lot of woman are not into anal, regardless of their drug use. And anal sex usually involves some prep work, its not something you want to do unless the person has prepared themselves for it, especially a constipated opiate addict.

BODY: Your way too young. Most doctors are not going to start you on the path of life long opiate use at 18. They are going to try all non-narcotic treatments first, and then still you might not get any opiates. I suggest trying a pain management doctor, and being honest about your pain. But don't expect your going to end up with a script right away, or if at all. Maybe consider trying kratom and see if that helps.

If its your old script, why are you concerned about the amount of pills in the bottle? So Im guessing this isn't your script. Replacing the pills you have taken with other pills is dumb. They are going to look different, and have different imprints. And obviously, Tylenol is not going to be nearly as effective as Oxy. If it was, then no one would need Oxy to manage their pain, sigh.

If you guys decide to allow this guy to stay for any length of time, you need to realize depending where you live, at least here in the USA, if you allow someone to stay at your house after a certain amount of time, some places it's two weeks, some places it's a month, then that basically becomes their legal residence, and you cant just tell them to leave, you need to go through the eviction process. I don't know what the laws are like in your country, but it's something to consider. If you allow him to stay, set some serious ground rules, and if he breaks any of them, bounce his ass out.

BODY: First I want to say I can relate to you somewhat on your situation. I was molested and abused as a child, and also as an adult. I understand all the disgusting feelings that go along with that. As Fash said, an all woman facility would be best for you. If you cant find one, then you need to be open and upfront about your abuse and trauma with the staff at your facility, so they understand and are in the best position to help you. You need to start talking about the abuse, the feelings you have about, and you need to start tackling that inner demon if you want to start healing and getting better. Being abused changes who you are to your very core, for the rest of your life. But you can take back some of your power and control, by dealing with it, and processing it and dealing with it in a way that dosent involve heroin. Good luck, you can do this, it wont be easy, but it will be worth it in the long run

I personally believe the only way to over come an addiction, is to deal with the underlying issues that make you use. Be them mental health issues, trauma, depression. Getting help for the things that your self medicating is the only real way to deal with addiction. Just my two cents of course. Trying other options certainly cant hurt.

BODY: Out of all the pills if your going to take them orally, Oxy is the best, followed by hydrocodone. Dilaudid and morphine have a low oral BA, and don't feel nearly as euphoric and enjoyable as Oxy does. A majority of pills on the DNM are presses that contain fentanyl, or some fent analogue. You don't want pills with fentanyl in them. There are a few vendors that sell real pills, but a majority are presses.

But I don't know, I also feel like people are adults, and if they want to post face pics, well then that's on them.

For a long time I blamed my use and addictions on my hard life, shity upbringing, etc. But at the end of the day, those are just excuses. The only person who is responsible for your addiction is YOU. Its easy to blame it all on your childhood, because then you don't have to accept the blame for your poor choices. But the fact that your an addict is your fault. Take responsibility for your choices, and if you want to get clean, then tackle your issues, and get clean. Quit blaming everyone one else, quit blaming society, quit acting like a victim.

BODY: I've always called Seroquel the "narcan" of stimulants. Whenever I've been tweaking and take Seroquel, it sobers me up, and knocks my ass out. And I find the next day, I need to wait for it to wear off, before I can really feel the full effects of stimulants again. Now I don't know if this is safe or anything, I've never experienced any negative effects, but that dosen't mean they can't happen.

TITLE: Watched Basketball Diaries tonight...., POST BODY: So I was sitting in my living room tonight watching basketball diaries, when my kid walk's into the room, and flops down on the couch next to me and ask's what I'm watching. The movie had already started, so I explain what was going on in the movie. My kid's are older, so this wasn't something inappropriate for them to watch. When it get's to the scene where he is going through withdrawl, my kid ask's me what's wrong with him. I explain to her what withdrawl is. My kid watches the scene, and is horrified by it, contrary to popular belief, my kid's lead a fairly "sheltered" normal, middle class existence. My kid shakes her head and say's "mom I'm *never* doing heroin" and I'm thinking to myself, please God, don't let her turn out like me......., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/6lz0aj/watched_basketball_diaries_tonight/

BODY: I was never homeless so I've never slept in a tent or in a park or anything, but I did live in a cockroach infested apartment in the hood when I was young. And the cockroaches were so bad at night when you wanted to sleep, you had to sprinkle a line of roach powder all the way around the bed, so the bastards wouldn't crawl on you when you were sleeping. Oh and you had to sleep with the lights on too, which helped keep them at bay. I think I would have rather slept in a tent, then slept in that apartment every night. Needless to say, I didn't sleep all that much during that period of my life, but still, it was awful.

Unless he was there strictly for detox, which it dosen't sound like he was. I would be prepared for that if I were you. If you really want him to get clean and get help, I would encourage him to stay longer. Otherwise just be prepared for things to go back the way they were. He probably dosen't want the rehab to know he's planing on leaving early so they don't pressure him to stay. Most rehabs are anywhere from 30-90 days.

TITLE: My unexpected Junkie Jesus moment, POST BODY: So today I went to Walmart. There was a very young couple flying a sign on the edge of the parking lot. Homeless people are pretty uncommon in my area, considering I live in a rural area, but I was in one of the "bigger cities" in my area. Anyway while I was in Walmart, I bought some personal care products for this couple, and some clean socks. I had a 20$ gift card in my wallet for Subway that I decided to give it to them too. After I checked out, I walked over to where the couple was, and gave them the bag of stuff I bought them and the gift card. As soon as I saw them, I knew they were addicts, and they looked pretty sick too. They seemed pretty surprised when I gave them the stuff, and thanked me profusely. I asked them if they were trying to get well. They both looked shocked by the question. The girl looked down at the ground, and didn't answer, but the guy shrugged, and said "yeah, we're hoping too." I reached into my wallet and took out 30$ and handed it to the guy. The girl started crying, and the guy said to me "hey, if your looking, we'll totally hook you up, we totally appreciate what you've done". I said "no thanks, I'm clean now, and in a pretty good place. I just wanted put some good karma out there". The girl asked me if she could hug me, and I gave her a hug, and she thanked me again. I told them to be safe, and went back to my car. I sat in my car and cried, because I remember how hard that life is, and I also thought about how easily I could be in the place they are in. Be safe everyone, I love all of you, and the struggle is real., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/6nhxkx/my_unexpected_junkie_jesus_moment/

BODY: Senile Grandma isn't going to OD in there house, or nod out and potentially start a fire, or leave a rig down where a child might get it. Having grandma living in your home will not get CPS called on you, but having an active drug user will. There are many variables to this. As adults, it isn't up to anyone to take care of us, or help us out, it's wonderful when someone does, but we are responsible for taking care of ourselves. Being pissed off because people won't allow you to live in their house while you use drugs and not "help you out" is ridiculous.

BODY: All benzos can be addictive. But benzos are much more effective for treating anxiety then codeine is, I mean that's what they are basically for. Opiates are for pain. But if you take benzos therapeutically, and only as needed, they aren't inherently dangerous. If you abuse benzos, or mix them with opiates, or alcohol, then yes, they are dangerous.

BODY: Well you certainly shouldn't use opiates, especially considering your an opiate addict. Try and get yourself some Seroquel, that will help you sleep. You know, you don't *have* to eat, people can go days without food and be *ok* as long as they remain hydrated. Get yourself some carnation instant breakfast or Ensure, and drink that. I would just deal with it, rather then risk taking opiates and start using those again as well as the weed, and end up addicted to them both.

BODY: Keep doing that, find things that can fulfill you that arent drugs. I'm coming up on two years clean, and the first year was pretty hard. But after the one year point or so, I finally started to feel better. I fixated less on drugs, felt naturally happy more often. If you can fight through the rough patches, it *does* get easier :)

BODY: On my 21st birthday I smoked a shit ton of crack, drank amaretto until I puked, and ended up fighting some hood rat bitch cause she thought I was "macking on her man". One of my worst birthdays ever. I ended the night with a black eye, a broken crack pipe, and all of my acrylic nails busted :( so it sounds like your birthday is going to better then mine was!

The problem is *keeping* it to once a week, or once every couple weeks. Once you experience that warm blanket, it's almost impossible to not want to do it all the time.

Try some Oxyclean, get the pre treater and treat the stain, and then get the tub of Oxyclean, and put some in water in your sink and soak it. If that dosen't work, then I can't imagine anything else will. Oxyclean is the shit

BODY: Let me say, as someone who was (and always will be) addicted to meth, your comparing apples to oranges. An addiction to meth is not the same as an addiction to opiates. There is no physical addiction with methamphetamine. It's allll mental. Stopping using meth is **much** easier then stopping opiates. I was/am a meth user for 20 years, and also an opiate addict. I've experienced both, and although they are both addicting, the meth is much easier to kick, because there is no physical withdrawl. There is mental withdrawl. Besides, you weren't even using meth that long, to become seriously addicted. You really shouldn't hold your idea's of recovery, from an entirely different drug up as the "standard" for everyone else.

BODY: Well 5mg isn't really going to get anyone high, it's an extremely low dose. And it is also a low dose for treating pain as well. If your exclusively looking to get high, try taking 10-15mg at a time. But I really suggest you don't do it. Your playing with fire. And you will run out of pills early if you start abusing them, and wont have anything for your pain. If your legit trying to handle your pain, and the pills arent working, call your doctor. I strongly advise you against getting high on them. They can ruin your life, and most addicts start out using pills recreationally

You can't have kids of your own with this guy as it stands, definitely shouldn't marry him. If he is this fucked up, I doubt he will be able to hold down a good paying long term job, and help with financial support. So why are you doing this? What are *you* getting out of this? Dosen't sound like much. I'd walk away, find someone who can be around your kid, who will encourage **you** to be healthy and sober. If this guy decides to get it together and get clean, you can revisit this again in the future. But right now, it dosen't sound like it's going to change or end well

I have stopped for a few short stints, but I always start back up again. I've tried everything. Medications, patches, gums, but I always end up smoking again.

BODY: We are locking fent warnings because there has been an influx of sourcing on those posts lately. The warnings are there for the community to see. Unfortunately many members of this community are using these post's to source, which we can't have, so locking the post is the best option. There are hundreds and hundreds of posts/comments made here a day. We try to read everything but sometimes we just can't. By locking these post's we can stop policing those threads and give attention to other things. There *really* dosen't need to be a ton of discussion on those posts anyways. The warning is visible, people can see it and be warned, they just can't source on them now. If someone has questions on fent warnings, PM the OP of the post to see of they can provide anymore information.

Dosen't look like a half G to me, but like I said, it's really hard to tell. I'm guessing if your gonna smoke it you have a meth pipe? There is a bit of an art to smoking it, if someone isn't there to show you, you might waste it or burn it. I prefer to snort it personally. But if your going to smoke it, throw one of those shards in your tube to start. Smoke it and see how you feel. How much did you pay for that? Knowing that might make it easier for me to guess the amount there

If its not crushed fine enough or it has cuts that don't vaporize well, then you will inhale little tiny scalding pieces and that is no bueno. But the high is intense, and it is cool to watch :)

BODY: I'm guessing that my tolerance would still be about the same. I had long periods of sobriety like this in the past, and when I started using again, my tolerance hadn't gone down much at all. When I was using meth/stims my preferred ROA was snorting. I would smoke it, but only if it was someone else's shit, and they wanted to pass a bowl around. And I would plug once in a while but my preference was always to snort. I've always wondered if my tolerance never resets because I've been such a long term user, and have used soooo much over my life, that there is just no getting that low tolerance back?

BODY: I knew this crack head chick, who had 6 or 7 kids all from different dudes, ranging from 11 to a new born baby. She lived in a disgusting cock roach infested house. She was prescribed fent patches for a "deformed toe" and she would wear them *and* smoke crack, and then breast feed her baby because she would sell all her WIC vouchers. Needless to say the baby slept constantly, and I checked it every time I was there to make sure it wasn't dead. Every night at 6pm all her kids would line up and she would give them each multiple spoon fulls of their "medicine" and make them go to bed. I asked her why they all required the same "medicine" and she admitted it was a combination of Benadryl and Nyquil, because she said they "just are too hyperactive to sleep" without it. She just wanted to be able to smoke crack all night long, and fuck random dudes without them bothering her. I called CPS on that bitch, and stopped going there to score. I've saw much worse things then this, but this has stuck with me for 20 years, and I often wonder what happened to all those poor kids.

BODY: I know you think it's easy for an addict to quit. If it really *was* that easy, don't you think we would quit? It's not that easy. There is the physical withdrawl, and after that is done, there are the mental cravings, and then there is PAWS (Google it if you don't know what it is) and then you have to deal with the pain and emotions, that come flooding back. It's not as easy as just stopping for two weeks, and everything is over and done with. I don't have an answer for you. Maybe he should try methadone if he dosen't like the subs. Maybe you two should look into some counseling, maybe he dosen't really want to be clean, who knows. But I think your expectations are a bit naive.

BODY: It's not hard, but sometimes I feel very *weird* for lack of a better word. I grew up dirt poor, in the worst part of a large city. Obviously I got into drugs early on, and lead a very unconventional life. I was running the streets, getting high, smoking crack, doing meth, I experienced everything that came along with that lifestyle. Violence, sex, manipulation, crime, etc. I didn't have kids early on like most of the girls I was friends with did, I wasn't a teen mom. I had them a little later in life, and I'm no saint, I've used off and on, although nothing compared to the life I was living before they we're born. And now I've been totally clean coming up on two years. I'm like this normal, everyday, middle class, middle age woman now, who volunteers at my kids school, and does bake sales and shit. And no one knows I was a crack head, no one knows I committed fraud to support my habit, no one knows I like to have kinky PnP meth sex and swing, no one knows I've been jumped multiple times buying drugs,like it's a completely different world. And it's nothing I'm really ashamed of, but I *know* people in my small, conservative town would judge the fuck out of me if they knew, and not allow their kids to hang out with mine ya know? So I keep it all a secret, and it's just *weird*. But it is a better life being clean, I feel pretty good most days, but I have my cravings and my thoughts just like everyone else.

BODY: There are plenty of functional users out there who maintain jobs and apartments. Not all heroin users inject, so track marks mean nothing. Can we tell you if this guy is a heroin addict? No. If he is just a FWB, then it really shouldn't matter either way. Use a condom, like you should be doing anyways, and enjoy the sex. This should only be a concern if your thinking about having a LTR with him, in that case, then you have a right to know the truth

I highly doubt any doctor is going to give you Oxy and certainly not Opana, unless you have a serious, confirmed diagnosis. It certainly dosen't hurt to try though, just don't get your hopes up, and be prepared to get new MRI's and be willing to try all the non-narcotic options the PM will want you to try first.

No one thinks they will become addicted or an addict, everyone thinks they can control it. If you insist on doing it, take 10mg of Oxy or Hydrocodone. But really, there is nothing intriguing about opiates. I mean if you think being broke, physically addicted, not able to shit or piss, and no sex drive intriguing then by all means, give it a go. Good luck.

BODY: Yeah it was made in the 90s, so it's been around for a while. It's also a true story, and a book with the same name that the movie was based off of. I also suggest the book, it was a very good read.

BODY: I dont think your selfish at all. Sex is an important part of a relationship, and you wanting to have it isn't selfish. I mean, are you guys not having it at *all* or just not very much? Either way, I would be extremely direct with her if you haven't been already. I know you've said that she's aware that your unhappy, but have been completely direct and said exactly how you feel, and that things really need to change? Dropping little hints or snarky comments is not the same as saying " we need to have more sex. I am unhappy and feel neglected, and if things don't change, I might end our relationship." She might not be totally aware of how frustrated you really are.

BODY: It's their mistake and your not responsible for it. If you *do* decide to be a nice guy and return the pills, their just going to account for them and waste them anyways, after a medication is dispensed once, even if it's a mistake and is returned, they legally can't dispense it again to someone else. I once got 30 too many Temazepam once, and when I realized I did call my pharmacy and return them, because well, they were Temzepam and not something I abused or was addicted to. They are a controlled substance though, and the pharmacist thanked me profusely and told me he could have gotten into a lot of trouble for the mistake. Now if it had been pain meds, I don't know if  I would have called them and brought them back.

At  allisonmedical.com they are apparently giving out a free sample kit, which I think is a free 10 pack of syringes of your choosing. Just scroll down about half way down the page, and there is a small form to fill out for the free sample pack. Like I said, I have not personally tried this since I am not an IV drug user, but if this is true, I thought this could be *very* useful to some of the IV drug user's here. If some of you try this and receive a starter pack, please update this thread so other's know that this is available. I know many of you can't get syringes, and I hope this help's some of you.

TITLE: Warning regarding posting pictures, POST BODY: As you already know, we no longer allow nude pictures to be posted that do not include dope. But we have generally allowed pictures that are dope porn or "selfies". We have always tried to warn the community that posting pictures on this sub is not necessarily the smartest choice, but we are all adults here, and have allowed people to make that decision for themselves

It has come to the attention of the mod team that a member here has been saving pictures posted here, and has been doing so for a *very* long time. It has also been brought to our attention that this person is using those pictures as possible doxxing and/or "blackmail" for lack of a better term material. So with that in mind, it would be in your best interest to not post identifying pictures here. This is not a good venue for doing that. I know many of us here value or privacy and anonymity very much, and we often don't think of the repercussions that can come from posting an innocent picture here. But those repercussions can be *very* real. The mod team want's to make sure you are all aware of this. We want everyone here to be safe. Physically safe, and personally safe as well.    , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/79xdvf/warning_regarding_posting_pictures/

TITLE: Non-opiate related question-CBD oil/extract, POST BODY: As some of you might know, I've been clean of all substances for almost two years. I've been working on myself, I've been doing therapy, taking my psych meds consistently, and all around not trying to fuck up. But I *do* suffer from intense anxiety, it's one of the reasons I started using to begin with. I am also a chronic pain patient, and do have a legit need for pain control. I'm not willing to go the kratom route, since it is illegal in my state. I am very reluctant to take benzos because I hate the way the make me feel, and I really am trying to avoid addictive substances. I'm taking Buspar for my anxiety, and it's worthless. I've lately been thinking about CBD for both my pain, and my anxiety. I've done some reading, and realize it isn't psychoactive, and won't get me high, which is good, because weed makes me anxious as hell. Does anyone here have any experience with CBD? Did it help you at all? I'm *considering* discussing it with my psyche, since she also specializes in homeopathic medicine, but I'm reluctant to even bring up anything that is drug related with doctors. Do you think bringing it up would raise red flags? Just looking for anyones general experiences. Thank you for any help you can offer. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7gj8dp/nonopiate_related_questioncbd_oilextract/

I'm tired of this shit, and I know the other mods are too. If you have a problem with someone, block them in your preferences. If someone is harassing you report their messages, and send a PM to /r/reddit.com and explain you are being harassed. The mod's here can only do so much (meaning very little) if you are being harassed or doxxed, that is something the admins have to deal with.

All of this drama and infighting has taken the focus of what this sub is here for, and that is to provide harm reduction and support. This sub hasn't seemed all that supportive lately and honestly that makes me sad. I volunteer my time to mod here, as well as the other mods, and we do it because we love this sub, and want to make sure it's here to help people. But I've personally had to devote a ton of time lately to all this drama, and so have the other mods. So please everyone, can we all act like the adults we are and stop with the trolling and the harassing and the general dumb shit, and bring the focus of this sub back to harm reduction and support? Upvote positive content, downvote negative content, and report posts that break the rules. If your having a problem please send us a modmail and we will do our best to help you.

I wasn't able to figure out the problem, so they asked me to post something for them. They are feeling kind of down, and hoping to get some input from the members here. This is what they asked me to post for them.


Title: My hope is fading

As I mentioned in a couple other post, something changed in me recently when i got off h onto subs. it was a very wierd wd process that took almost 10 days to actually start taking subs.

but anyways, life is great no urge for opiates at all. I don't miss them, i don't want them, I've been tested by people several times with no problems.

but I've been in a lot of pain over the last few days... how tf am I going to do this? I can't live my life in this pain. and I definitely can't work like this, which I start Monday.

I feel really down right now. I feel like i had this beautiful balloon floating above me and some one just came and popped it.

on top of the mental, and physical part, i have type 1 diabetes. every time I'm in pain like this my blood sugar goes into the 300's and 400's.

I know there is not really anything you guys can do. but thanks for listening.



If anyone has any words of wisdom or advice, please post it here, or pm u/vforvendetta8870, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/81mxm4/making_this_post_for_uvforvendetta8870/

TITLE: Carfentenil Warning-Philadelphia, POST BODY: I received this PM from a member here, so I thought I would copy/paste it here to make everyone aware.




Idk if you wanna put a Carfentenil warning up for philly - but a bunch of blocks just recently these last couple of weeks starting mixing in Carfentenil into their dope and it‚Äôs really fucked up. The shit is not an opiate high - it‚Äôs kind of like tripping on mushrooms. And for those people that have a high tolerance and get it, they do like 5,6,7 bags at once - it‚Äôs going to fuck their mind up like they‚Äôve never been fucked before. That‚Äôs personal experience right there too.

I just recently went to a popular set and copped, and even they added the Carfentenil. I‚Äôm scared to do anymore than 2 bags now. ANYWHERE; and I know every block and every set really really well.



Edit-I have received a lot of PM's about this warning, and I just want to say that I do not live in this area and I don't know anything about the dope there. I posted this for another member who asked me to post it. This is a copy/paste of the PM they sent me



Edit 2-I have been informed that the dope does not contain carfentenil, it contains 2-me-maf a fentanyl analog. Once again, I do not know this for a fact, these are the reports I am getting from users in that area. Regardless, please be careful everyone., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/81yqx0/carfentenil_warningphiladelphia/

TITLE: Just need to vent, POST BODY: This isn't *really* opiate related, but I guess in a way it kind of is. Anyways, as a lot of you know, Ive been sober from opiates and stimulants for over two years now. I'm not a drinker, I don't smoke 
pot anymore, so outside of some Cyclazodone (a mild stimulant/notropic) I recently did, I have been totally clean. I have been in therapy, and I have been taking all different kinds of anti-depressants and shit. Like you many of you guys, I use drugs to self medicate. I have lifelong depression since I was a child, and crippling anxiety. Drugs always masked those things for me. I have been trying to  work on my issues. Ive been taking my meds correctly, doing the work my therapist wants. I havent been half assing like I have done in the past. And *nothing* seems to be working. The meds arent helping, and my doctor is constantly changing them and increasing the doses, which make me feel like shit. They have completely destroyed my sex drive. I've always had a very *healthy* sex drive, and now I could care less if I ever see another dick or a pair of tits. Since Ive stopped the stims, Ive gained weight, which I absolutely *hate*. I was a size 0 for years, and now I feel disgusting. Honestly, this is the longest period of sobriety I've had since I was 15 (I'm in my 40's now) and I'm starting to hate it. Feeling like this *isnt* worth it. I know now it is really just a matter of time before I start using again if something dosen't change. For a while I was feeling really good, riding that pink cloud, super proud of myself. And now I just want to get high, get **numb** on anything, dosent matter what it is. I just needed to piss and moan, and get this off my chest. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I love you all., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8foxpc/just_need_to_vent/

I asked him not to leave, that I loved him, and he said "I promise I'll be back and everything will be okay". He never came back, and things were far from OK. For years I hated him, blamed him for being an addict. But now he is the only parent I have left. We speak occasionally, I send him pictures of my children he doesn't know. And now I've come to forgive him as much as I can. I spent years hating him, and those years were wasted. I got nothing from them. And now he is sick and will die soon, and I will never know him, and he will never know me.

I know a lot of your relationships with your parents are strained. But when their gone, their gone. They are the only parents you will have. Call them, tell them you love them. Visit them. Learn from my mistakes., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8rtyvo/so_i_spoke_to_the_man_who_is_my_father_today/

TITLE: Fentanyl Warning-Philly, POST BODY: This is a copy/paste of a PM someone sent me.    

I‚Äôm sending this to you cause it identifies my area pretty specifically, hopefully you can post it anonymously. These are blue bags w/ no stamp, they‚Äôre sold as fentanyl not dope, and they‚Äôre sold by a decent sized crew out of West and Southwest Philly. I did see a post similar to this, but it was clearly about North Philly, so I wanted to put this out to warn people who cop in W/SW. I‚Äôve been copping from this crew for a while, and this last batch was definitely some sort of twisted RC or fentalog. It caused terrifying hallucinations, blackouts, uncontrollable vomiting for hours, and a migraine that lasted for two days. I‚Äôve been shooting dope everyday for 4 years and have never experienced anything like this from any type of opiate. I talked to some other people who cop from there, and they all had similar experiences. if you cop blue bags from W or SW, be careful, and go elsewhere if you can., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8wwpiz/fentanyl_warningphilly/

TITLE: The last few days have been a disaster for this, and I'd like to reach out to the community, POST BODY: The last few days have been filled with drama. People making multiple accounts so they can post negative things about other people, harassment of some sub members, and also doxxing. The mod team has been attacked for being biased assholes on a power trip, and this is just a recap of *some* of it.

We are all adults in this sub. I don't understand why some people can't act like it. If your having a problem with another sub member, block them, don't argue with them for an entire post. Act like the adult that you are. If the problem is serious, contact the mods. If you feel you are being harassed, please contact the mods or better yet the admins. To contact the admins send a PM to /r/reddit.com We are generally a group of good people, some of us think of each other as family. But some of us have been behaving badly, and it's sad. The mods have been working furiously for several days to handle this. Sub members here have no idea the things we have to deal with, they only hear one persons side and decide we're assholes. We keep logs of who we ban, why we ban, when we ban them, we have a private wiki of sorts where we keep notes and keep track of shit and communicate. Fuck we have spread sheets for shit. I know I personally put in around 15 hours a week modding here. Being a mod isnt fun, it's work. We get no perks, no pay, and are berated and insulted every single day. I've been threatened that I will be doxxed, that someone will take my kids, that someone will rape and kill me several times. all because I banned someone or wont unban them. Yet everyone complains how were assholes.
The other mods put in hours and hours too,and are fully devoted to this sub. They also receive hate messages and are harassed. I am not looking for pity or a pat on the back. I'm trying to make everyone aware that the mod team **does care** if we didn't we sure as hell wouldnt be here 

Im imploring all of you to please stop with the fighting, name calling, alt accounts, and general harassment of other members. We are looked down on enough by society already, we should all be able to come here and not be harassed or called names or berated. This is supposed to be a supportive community. Can we get back to that **please**? I love all of you., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/92jftw/the_last_few_days_have_been_a_disaster_for_this/

BODY: There are filler and binders in pills that are not meant to be inhaled and are not water soluble. Also, hydromorphone has a BA of around 50% when snorted, so your not absorbing all of the drug when snorting it. What is on your finger is a combination of fillers/binders and hydromorphone. It also dosent look like you crushed it well enough because the beads are still intact.

BODY:  In an effort to ensure that quality seeds remain legal to buy and available to the public,  and that people do not receive potentially harmful advice regarding dosage amounts, **we are no longer allowing posts about poppyseed tea in public.** It has been proven that law enforcement officers and legislators view this subreddit, so by restricting posts about PST we hope to avoid the attention of lawmakers and law enforcers who may see seeds as the next opiate trend to debase and debauch children. By keeping it out of the public eye, we hope to be able to continue to utilize this legal*ish* gift from the gods. 
        
**Please direct all of your PST related posts or questions to /r/poppytea.** We hope to minimize visibility by keeping all mentions of tea in a much less surveilled subreddit.

Millions and millions of people in America are addicted to something. These millions of people also have jobs, families, friends social lives, kids, etc. They *are* regular people.

Addiction **has** been classified as a disease, and I doubt anyone would ask someone with AIDs or diabetes such rude question, but we're open season?

Some vendors also post lab testing results to verify their claims, and I'd like to just ad, that I was an affiliate for an RC vendor years ago. At one point, he obtained a small amount of an RC that tested at 99.3% pure. He provide those results to customers, to back up his purity claim. He continued to use that one print out from that test on *every* new batch of that drug he received. He didn't test the new batches, they were never the from the same lab as the original batch and he had no way of knowing the purity, but he would photo shop the date of that testing sheet and provide it *everytime* as proof. Remember, vendors are just drug dealers, and you can never trust them, or their claims.

As you can see from these prior discussions, weight has little bearing. Opiates bind to your receptor in your brain, they don't saturate your blood to intoxicate you.

BODY: Alprazolam is a white crystalline powder, which is soluble in methanol or ethanol but which has no appreciable solubility in water at physiological pH.

Each XANAX Tablet, for oral administration, contains 0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg of alprazolam.

XANAX Tablets, 2 mg, are multi-scored and may be divided as shown below:


Inactive ingredients: Cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, lactose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.5 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 and the 1 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C Blue No. 2.

Alprazolam is not water soluble. It says so right here, and on countless other pages. Regardless if they are name brand pills or generic, alprazolam in any form, *not just Xanax* is not water soluble.

You should really stay far away. Opiates are unlike any other class of drugs in that they sneak up on you and you're hooked before you even notice there's a problem.

TITLE: Hey guys, what kind of drug subs do you want to see?, POST BODY: Hey guys. For those who don't know me, I am a mod of this sub, and I mod quite a few other drug related subs, including r/stims, r/cocaine, r/fuckingtweakers r/cocainegonewild etc. I'm looking for ideas on what kind of drug related communities you feel are lacking. As many of you know, there are a lot of great drug subs out there, but what else do you want to see? Keep in mind it dosent need to be opiate related. I've been thinking of maybe something strictly for paraphernalia? Bongs, pipes, etc. Or a drugsgonemild sub? Something risque, but not full frontal. I dunno. Looking to start something fun and appreciated by the community, so throw your ideas out there!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/a5i3bz/hey_guys_what_kind_of_drug_subs_do_you_want_to_see/

My kids are older, and very smart and perceptive. I didn't want to worry about if they could tell something was "off" with me, or different. I've always been a highly functional user, if I didnt want you to know, you didnt know I used. But just the thought that my kids *might* pick up on it made me feel terrible. As a parent, I'm *obligated* to try my hardest to be a good mom. I owed it to my kids to try my absolute hardest to stop using. And thankfully, it worked, for now at least.

He got in the back with me, and started getting the shit out and was weighing it. It was about 2am in the middle of the hood. A car pulled up a few car lengths behind us. My dealer started to freak out, said it was members from a rival gang, and they we're trying to take over his block. He pulls his handgun out of his waist, and hands me our drugs, and tells us to get the fuck out of there. He jumps out of our car, and starts shooting at the car parked behind us. They start shooting as well. My friend floors it, and I lay down on the floor of the back seat, praying to God a bullet dosen't come through the window and hits me. Thankfully none of us we're hurt. And of course, we we're back there the next day, buying from the same guy.

Maybe OP is being an angry dick because he's just an angry dick, and it has nothing to do with an "atypical benzo reaction".

TITLE: Today I am 3 years clean, POST BODY: Today I have been clean for 3 years. I am a poly-substance drug addict, with my DOC's being stimulants and Oxy. I started using when I was 15, and instantly fell in love with being high. Drugs made me forget everything. The pain from being molested and neglected as a child would disappear. I felt amazing. But that honeymoon stage only lasts so long. It starts out so beautiful, but turns ugly so fast. Addiction is a lot like an abusive boyfriend. It starts out amazing, but then it slowly starts to change. What made you happy now is hurting you, it's killing you, and you don't know what to do. You try and leave, but the pain of living without it is agonizing. You think  maybe if you try again, this time it will be different. This time you'll remain in control, this time it won't hurt you. But it does. The pain and sickness and fear is back, and you know if you don't figure out how to leave and live without it, it will kill you one day.

I'm still trying to learn to live without it. Not going to lie and say it's easy. It's not. And I don't know if I am going to remain sober forever, I'm guessing that someday I'll use again, but as of today, I will not let it back in my life. I love all of you, and I appreciate all the friends I've made here, and the support I've received. I appreciate this community, and everyone here, and what it stand's for. Thank you for letting me share this tonight. Much love., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/amwafk/today_i_am_3_years_clean/

They say you will not experience any physical withdrawl by doing this. How is this possible? If you are addicted to heroin, and then take methadone for 5 days, and then stop I*both* cold turkey, wouldnt you still have withdrawl? You're still stopping opiates cold turkey. Why would using methadone for 5 days eradicate all physical withdrawl symptoms?

And by the time you pay a vet bill and pay for the medication, you've spent hundreds of dollars on a few trams or less then 1 mg of bupe, which we all know as opiate addicts that would be fairly worthless. I think one or two people did this and the press decided to run with it and spin it into something it isnt, much like they did with Narcan parties.

He dosent owe you heroin, and you don't have to stay with him and his addiction either. If you're not ready to stop, then tell him that, and make an arrangement to move out, and support yourself and your habit.

BODY: Eh since you have no one referring you, and no diagnosis or medical history/records I wouldnt expect much. They need to know what's causing your pain before they will treat it. Unless it's a shady doctor, and there aren't many of those around anymore. Pain management with opiates is the last resort treatment. Doctors are going to want to try non-narcotic medications, PT, injections, etc before considering opiates. I was in pain management for 10 years, and I had to try all the other options before getting on opiates. If you have any doctor records showing previous treatments or diagnosis then you should bring those with. Seriously dont have your hopes up if you dont have any diagnosis or anything though

BODY: Sounds like he's tired of footing the bill, and waiting for you to be ready to stop. Maybe he cant afford to pay for it anymore, maybe he feels like your use is impacting his life too much. You say you asked to be allowed to start paying for your own H, why are you asking permission to buy your own drugs? Just buy them and support your own habit. Don't allow him or count on him to supply them for you. Doing that has shifted the power and given him control over you. Are you working? Contributing financially to your guy's home? Pulling your weight in the relationship? I mean, if your not doing those things either I can understand his frustration. Also, he's addicted to meth and supporting a meth addiction usually costs a lot less then supporting an opiate addiction, I am addicted to both drugs, and a meth habit is a lot cheaper then an opiate habit usually, at least in my area, so he's probably using that as a rationalization too. Like I said, two addicts in a relationship equals disaster. When drugs are more important then your partner, then of course things will never work. Hopefully things get better for you.

TITLE: So, lets talk about supporting harm reduction!, POST BODY: So, I know if you're like me you do a lot of shopping on Amazon. Did you know that you can choose to have Amazon donate 0.5% of your purchase to a charity of your choosing? The company I choose to  support is dancesafe.org. If you aren't familiar with dancesafe, they are a harm reduction focused group that have been around for a long time. They sell fent strips, drug testing kits, and they  have a huge presence on the festival/rave scene. They hand out water, harm reduction info, and will test your drugs for free. They are really a good harm reduction group. I encourage everyone to change their settings on Amazon, and start contributing to dancesafe (or any other charity of your choosing, it dosent have to be a harm reduction charity) I mean, it will only take you a minute of your time, literally, to do something good for dancesafe (or another charity) I love you guys, stay safe!

And a marriage involves another person, and if they arent willing to do those things there's nothing you can do about it. You cant control another person. 

You can control if you stay clean or not. And lots of people have limitless motivation and energy. I mean, there will be ebbs flows, but people consistently can achieve their goals. Telling yourself otherwise is just a way of deluding yourself into accepting your addiction. "Oh, it's impossible, no one can do this, blah blah blah." Plenty of people find sobriety and maintain it. It really is about wanting it, and taking the steps you need to take to maintain it.

BODY: Well, you can be sent to the best rehab in the entire world, and if you arent ready to stop using, it isnt the rehabs fault, it's your own fault. Rehabs arent a cure all place for addicts. Rehabs are there to give you some of the tools you need to battle your disease. If you aren't ready to use those tools, then that's the individuals fault, not really the rehabs. So many people go to rehab thinking that they will be cured by the rehab itself, and that's not how it works. Just like with any disease, addiction requires constant treatment. Therapy, maintenance drugs for some, lifestyle changes, behavior modification, etc. Rehabs are just a tool in treating addiction, it isn't a cure all

The rehab isn't losing any money by giving you the 2K, it's just part of your insurance bill.

BODY: When I used to do it, I always got paid right away when I was done. They never tested me before I donated, they would ask me if I took any drugs, prescribed or otherwise, and I always said no. They clean the plasma after you donate it, so I dont think they really care. I mean, 80 percent of the people that went there we're addicts, and the workers there obviously knew it. I can't imagine it would be cost efficient to test every customer when they donated, especially considering they clean the plasma anyways. Of course, things might be different now, I havent donated in many years

All it says is not to to be very careful mixing the two because of the increased respiratory depression. And this is Boxed Warning where it also dosent really say anything about it, that's why I asked. I thought maybe they explained why it does that. I was just curious, it's not a big deal or anything.

BOXED WARNING
Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coadministration with other CNS depressants, infection, pulmonary disease, respiratory depression, respiratory insufficiency, uremia
Avoid nalbuphine coadministration with other CNS depressants unless no other alternatives are available, as coadministration significantly increases the risk for respiratory depression, low blood pressure, and death. If nalbuphine must be administered to patients with pulmonary disease (i.e.,  asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory insufficiency), use extreme caution and initiate treatment at the lowest effective dose. Caution is also recommended for use in patients with impaired respiration from uremia, severe infection, cyanosis, or respiratory obstructions. Nalbuphine may produce respiratory depression similar to the effect from equianalgesic doses of morphine. Nalbuphine, however, has a 'ceiling effect' for respiratory depression, where doses greater than 30 mg do not produce further respiratory depression in the absence of other CNS depressant agents.

BODY: The sourcing on dope porn posts was insane, people can believe it, or not. And if us mods we're seeing the sourcing, then the admins we're also seeing the sourcing. This sub was created for harm reduction. It wasn't made for dope porn, sourcing, and scamming, which is what was going on. Legit harm reduction posts we're getting buried under pics of T3's and lortabs, and pics that we're stolen from Google and posted here as "dope porn".  What you see as a negative many people here don't, so saying it's undeniable isnt true.

Comments like that make myself (cant speak for the rest of the mods) irritated, because the last thing we are worrying about is "lightening our loads" or doing less for this sub and the members then they deserve. We all devote massive amounts of our personal time because we're passionate about harm reduction, and lightening the load is never and was never a consideration.

BODY: The cravings are insane, for real. There isn't really any physical dependence with meth/stim addiction, but the mental addiction and effects are awful. A lot of stim addicts have intense cravings for years. I know I still have them and I've been clean for over three years. it makes it so much harder to stay clean when you have overwhelming cravings every day. Be safe my friend.

Your head space feels off because Tramadol is not only an opiate, but also has some SSRI properties to it. It tends to make people feel "spacey" and there isnt much you can do about it. Try talking to your doctor again, and make it very clear how it makes you feel.

BODY: It certainly would help. And it dosent sound like you've tried stimulants before, but generally most people love them or not. You very well might be the type that dosent love them, and can take them therapeutically. Or you might not. What would be best is have your fiance or a close friend just kind of keep an eye on you, and call you out if it looks like your starting to abuse them. Having someone keeping an eye on you and keeping you accountable wouldnt be a bad thing.

I am surprised her doctor prescribed her Adderall knowing she is an addict, but I also see it where she is now 70 pounds over weight, which is quite a bit. I dont fully understand her health issues, but having fatigue to begin with, and extreme weight gain like this, I can see where a doctor would write for a stimulant. The only thing that surprises me is that the doctor would write it for an admitted addict.

BODY: I'm not. Naloxone has an almost nonexistent oral BA it's about 1-2% by mouth, so taking it orally basically renders it ineffective. Now, if you inject it, then that's a whole different can of worms. It is added to sub strips to deter people from injecting it. People still do of course, but that's why its there. I'm not spreading misinformation. Look up the BA on oral Naloxone. 


"Naloxone is poorly absorbed when taken by mouth, so it is commonly combined with a number of oral opioid preparations, including buprenorphine and pentazocine, so that when taken orally, just the opioid has an effect, but if misused by injecting, the naloxone blocks the effect of the opioid.[1][18] This combination is used in an effort to prevent abuse.[18] In Germany, tilidine is sold in a fixed combination with naloxone."

Not once have I said that Narcan dosent reverse opioid withdrawl. And I've personally known quite a few people who we're hit with Narcan who woke up high as a kite, and did not go into PWD. And I've known a few people who did go into it. I never once said that Narcan (Naloxone) cannot or will not cause PWD. What I did say, is that it is not how it works with *Suboxone strips* so I would appreciate it if you didn't try to put words into my mouth. If the doctor comments and say's I am completely misinformed, then I have learned something new, and will be happy to have the correct information. But, in the mean time, I'd appreciate it if you weren't so patronizing and rude, because I have been neither of those things with you. I am sharing information that I have received from medical professionals and other active addicts, and if it is incorrect, I have no problem admitting it. I'm sure the Doctor will have no problem letting me know if I'm misinformed.

TITLE: Posts about lethal amounts, POST BODY: We often get post's from people asking what the lethal amount would be of so and so drug. Often they say they are asking because they are just curious, etc. Generally, these are posts by people who are thinking of killing themselves and are trying to figure out how much they'll need to get the job done. Usually if you look at their post histories there will some posts about depression or suicide. I'm asking everyone in the community to not answer these posts with specific amounts, and page a mod or report them. Obviously this sub dosent exist for the purpose of helping people harm themselves, in fact that is the total opposite of what this sub is for. I appreciate everyone's help reporting content like this. 

And please, if you're struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, please reach out for help. You can start by calling National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) Veterans press 1 to reach specialized support.


Edit- I just want to make it clear that I dont intend to remove all the posts asking about dosing or if they took too much. What I'm saying is that suicide posts are usually pretty easy to spot, and those are the posts I'm really referring to., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/cy5936/posts_about_lethal_amounts/

TITLE: Out of the mouth's of babes..., POST BODY: So, I look out my window and see one of the local cops outside. Apparently there is someone laying in the ditch in front of my house. This is an *extremely* rare occurrence in my area. Things like this just don't happen. I go out on my deck to see what is going on.

I can hear the cop talking to the guy. He is drifting in and out of consciousness, and I can hear the cop asking him what drugs he's taken or how much he's had to drink. I'm standing there watching, wondering why he hasn't hit the guy with Narcan, wondering if maybe they don't carry it on them. My kid was watching through the window( my kid isn't a little kid btw, but is under 18), and cracks the door. They ask me if the guy is ok and what's wrong. I said I think he's had some kind of drug overdose or he is drunk. My kid says to me "did they give him any Narcan?" And I am totally taken aback. I said, " how do you know what Narcan is?" And my kid responds "That's what the always do on LivePD when they find someone passed out. They give them Narcan and they always wake up. Narcan saves lives". And I'm standing there trying not smile, proud as hell. "Yep, your right, Narcan saves lives" I responded.

BODY: So relateable. I have no idea what normal sex and intimacy are. I was sexually molested as a child, which completely warped my sense of what sex was meant for. In my teens sex was basically just a tool in my arsenal of survival skills. Then when I got addicted to meth, sex became something else. All I wanted was sex, the more deviant the better. I was down for anything, and no fucks we're given. Now I've been sober for a few years, and sex is boring. Nothing compares to meth fueled, nasty sex. I've actually just kind reconciled myself to the fact that I will never know what "normal sex is.

The fact you expect junkies and dboys and middles to all be stand up, honest people is ridiculous. Dboys lie, it's their fucking job. Middles and junkies do shady shit, and you shouldnt use another person to get your drugs and expect it will always work out 100% of the time. And when it dosent, you dont snitch.

BODY: I'm not defending her behavior. I'm saying that drug addicts lie and steal. Dboys lie and steal. The drug game revolves around people breaking the law, lying, and cheating each other so they can feed their addictions. This shit happens, and when it does, you take the L and move on. Don't use her anymore, tell other people not use her either, and be done with it. You don't snitch on people. You're an addict who breaks the law every day yourself. Is it ok that someone snitch on you if you piss them off? Try and ruin your life? That's ok with you? I doubt it is. So dont do it to someone else.

BODY: Some people chips for years before it happens. I knew someone like you who chipped for 10 years before addiction set in. You're a fool if you think you're immune to heroin addiction. Some people can chip and never get addicted, but most can't, and it eventually catches up with them. Oh, and the nausea goes away when you start using more btw.

BODY: It feels very euphoric to me. I'm happy and energetic. And we all said the same thing. We're just going to try it once. We're only going to do it on the weekends, we have too much willpower to become addicted, etc. No plans on becoming an addict. But, if you're hell bent on playing with fire, start with 20mgs and see how you feel.

Also keep in mind there will be a lot more LE out and about the next week or so, so be smart when you're traveling. Wear your seat belt, don't speed, make sure your registration is up to date and all your lights are working correctly. Don't give LE an excuse to pull you over. Detoxing in jail would make for a miserable Christmas. So please guys, be smart, be safe, and make sure you are thinking of other peoples safety this holiday season.

BODY: It dosent sound like he's ready to admit he has a problem, and deff not ready to quit using opiates, so you need to think about what's best for you, and let him figure out what's best for him on his own. You can't make an addict quit until they are ready to quit, and it dosent sound like he's ready. So you can stay with him, and continue to deal with this for God knows how long, or you can leave and do what's best for you.

BODY: I am an addict, I am a polysubstance drug addict with 20+ year addiction, and I never expected anyone to help me or support me when I was actively using drugs, lying, and treating them like utter shit. No one should sacrifice there well being to support someone who is unwilling to help themselves. Now when someone is making healthy choices and doing the right thing, then sure supporting them is a great thing. But when someone refuses to seek help, is being mentally abusive, and causing a serious decline in the quality of life of someone else, that person is not obligated to stand by and blindly love and support that person. You have that woe is me junkie mentality where you think everyone else needs to help you get it together, but that's a normal personality trait among addicts, blame everyone but yourself

They leave, and get to continue on in there lives, getting high and partying, while the woman is the one desperately trying to keep it together and take care of the kid on there own. Of course, if you're a drug addict, male or female, you obviously shouldn't be having kids while addicted.

I highly doubt you would have made the same comment about OP being a terrible father if OP had was a man. Misogyny is alive and well on reddit.

TITLE: Five Years Clean Today And Dead Inside, POST BODY: Hey ya'll,

I was driving home from the grocery store today when I realized I am 5 years clean today. I am a polysubstance drug addict, and my DOC's are stimulants (meth, APVP) and pain pills (Oxy) I had used for 20 years off and on before I finally quit. Life is extremely different for me now then it was when I was in the throws of my addiction. I live in a nice house, drive a nice car, have a purse full of money and good credit. My kids are amazing and I realize how blessed I am to have them. Fuck, I'm on the PTA. All the trappings of a normal, middle class life, that is the societal ideal. And yet, I'm dead inside. I feel very little emotion, rarely feel any happiness. I truly believe I damaged my brain with all my years of drug use, and this is the end result. And fuck this, it sucks. That is all. Be safe guys, test your shit, don't use alone, and know that I love you., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/lcvw0h/five_years_clean_today_and_dead_inside/

BODY: No they aren't the same. But, is the person with the chronic pain who is buying the pills possibly also an addict, and in denial that they have a problem? Many pain patients are also opiate addicts (myself included) and use there chronic pain as an excuse to abuse opiates. When they run out of there pills early it's certainly not because they're abusing them, it's because of the pain of course. They need opiates to manage there pain and to function, it's not like they're getting high off them or anything (they deff are) etc. Pain patients can definitely be as much of an addict as a heroin addict, same addiction, different causation

BODY: No one can give you accurate dose guidelines. Here are some tips though:

Always start small: you can always take more, but you cannot "un-take" a large dose.

If at all possible, have someone around that knows you use, with Narcan, and knows how to use said Narcan. It's not really possible to Narcan yourself in the case of a medium-large dose overdose.

Always test your substances for Fentanyl: Make sure to mix the product up real good and test different parts of it. If it's a pill, break it up and test parts of it. For a true test, dissolve your substance/pill in water, and once fully mixed, test the solution.

If you have no tolerance/relapsed/coming back from a break, start small again. Your same dose as before can be too much for you now.

All in all, be careful, stay safe, and take care of yourself.

BODY: I'm sorry, but you didn't have the determination and self control to stop your kratom use before it got to this point, you expect to have it when it comes to heroin use? And you're going to have withdrawl, it's inevitable,  it's just not going to be from kratom, it's going to be from heroin instead, and it's going to suck regardless.

I am unhappy, and have no problem admitting it.

BODY: No one can give you accurate dose guidelines. Here are some tips though:

Always start small: you can always take more, but you cannot "un-take" a large dose.

If at all possible, have someone around that knows you use, with Narcan, and knows how to use said Narcan. It's not really possible to Narcan yourself in the case of a medium-large dose overdose.

Always test your substances for Fentanyl: Make sure to mix the product up real good and test different parts of it. If it's a pill, break it up and test parts of it. For a true test, dissolve your substance/pill in water, and once fully mixed, test the solution.

If you have no tolerance/relapsed/coming back from a break, start small again. Your same dose as before can be too much for you now.

All in all, be careful, stay safe, and take care of yourself.

I was polysubstance addict for 20+ years and I stopped using 5 years ago, and I had no mental break down or anything like that, and 99.9% of people who stop using don't. I honestly just feel like you're finding reasons to rationalize your use, which we all do until we're ready to admit it and quit. Dosen't sound like you're there yet. Maybe you'll get there before it's too late, maybe you won't. It's really on you. Be safe.

BODY: No one can give you accurate dose guidelines. Here are some tips though:

Always start small: you can always take more, but you cannot "un-take" a large dose.

If at all possible, have someone around that knows you use, with Narcan, and knows how to use said Narcan. It's not really possible to Narcan yourself in the case of a medium-large dose overdose.

Always test your substances for Fentanyl: Make sure to mix the product up real good and test different parts of it. If it's a pill, break it up and test parts of it. For a true test, dissolve your substance/pill in water, and once fully mixed, test the solution.

If you have no tolerance/relapsed/coming back from a break, start small again. Your same dose as before can be too much for you now.

All in all, be careful, stay safe, and take care of yourself.

BODY: #*Pressed pill inquiries are not permitted under any circumstances.*

There is absolutely no way that we can tell you if the pill you have is real or if it is pressed by looking at a picture of it. If you are wondering if they make presses of the pill you have, the answer is very likely going to be yes. [You can take a look at some of the dies that are easily available for purchase here.](https://imgur.com/a/6EPiLul) 

If you are worried that your tablet is pressed and contains fentanyl you should [purchase some fentanyl test strips here.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10-free-shipping/) This is the only way you can be pretty confident your pill does not contain fentanyl unless you picked them up at the pharmacy yourself. Be mindful that not all fentanyl analogues can be detected by fentanyl test strips.

----
#Pressed Fentanyl Detection

Fentanyl pressed pills are especially dangerous because they are often sold as regular pharmaceutical pills which are normally considered *safe*. They can be very hard to spot even if you know exactly what the real pills look like.
With the widespread explosion of fentantyl pressed pills it is recommended that you **apply the utmost caution before ingesting any opiate that you do not have the direct prescription for.**

Generally speaking, pressed pills will be lower quality than their pharmaceutical counterparts. 

    One or more of the following will usually be off:

* **Taste**

* **How they break**

* **Color**

* **Imprint**

*Pictures mean nothing in comparisons and only experience/physical examination can begin to help you determine authenticity.*

*Another tip is comparing them against all others in the batch that you are buying from. There should be little to no differences.*

However, there are never any guarantees and presses are getting better and better. The only 2 ways to be sure are if it is your prescription and if you get it lab tested. Proceed with caution. 

**A slightly cheaper option is [**Test Kits**](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/), but they may not work on all known analogues*

**Here are some examples of Fake Presses:**

1. [FAKE EPIC Pharm E8](https://imgur.com/3NAVLfm) comparison (fake left/Real Right) 

2. [FAKE A215](https://imgur.com/kUZxegN) -Notice the hook on the 5 curves up like the font on this 5. Should be parallel with divider line. Also not clean edges. Should be smooth. You can't tell in this pic but they were also smaller in diameter

#Fentany Reagent Testing 

--

Although [Lab testing](https://www.ecstasydata.org/) is the only foolproof way to see what absolutely constitutes a substance, there are a few things you can do to minimize risk when there is a suspected fentanyl (or analogue) adulterant.
_________________
The best option is through reagent testing using a variety of tests like Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde. Using these three you will be able to identify between many different psychoactive and Fentanyl Analogues. 

Find more information on, where to get reagent tests, color-codes for different [substances](https://dancesafe-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/01/2017-chart-a.jpg), and up to date reagent-color-codes for other analogues/compounds at /r/ReagentTesting.  

An extremely helpful chart when differentiating between fentanyl analogues and other opiates can be found, [here](https://imgur.com/c0BoewL). It's important to note that if there are different types of substances in your mixture that the reaction depicted by the reagent testing table may have more than one result. As such, one result that is a darker color may cover a lighter color. To overcome this, multiple tests is preferred. It is best to do a thin layer chromatography screening test (to separate out the mixture). These are available from suppliers like [Bunk police. TM](http://bunkpolice.com/separation-test-kit/). They will insure that your results are not obfuscated.
__________________________
Another option (that is more expensive, less accurate, but may work in a pinch), is to use pre-designed *[Fentanyl Test Strips](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)*. An important note with test strips is that they will only detect the fentanyl and anologues that they are designed to. In this particular case they only test for Fentanyl,
Butyryl-fentanyl, Acetyl-fentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, 4-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, and Sufentanil. That is to say that they will not work for any future analogues that are released.

Choose whichever method you are most compatible to the risk.

You should really stay far away. Opiates are unlike any other class of drugs in that they sneak up on you and you're hooked before you even notice there's a problem.

BODY: Tramadol needs to be taken orally to have any opioid effects. Do not snort, smoke, IV or boof tramadol as it isn't worth it. Tramadol itself is serotonergic and has no opioid receptor activity. It has to be converted into O-desmethyltramadol in the liver to be active at the opioid receptor. Taking more than 400 mg of tramadol a day can cause seizures, so do not take tramadol if you are prone to seizures. It should not be mixed with other drugs that are serotonergic. Some people are very poor metabolizers of tramadol and will not experience strong opioid effects. If you do not have any opioid effects within 45 minutes after taking 50 to 100 mg of tramadol then you aren't likely to. It is not advisable to take more as that will increase your risk for seizure and/or serotonin syndrome. People with a high tolerance to opioids may not experience any effects, other than serotonergic, from tramadol as it is weaker than codeine.
