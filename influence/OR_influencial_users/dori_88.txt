TITLE: Can I Introduce Myself? Fuck it. I'm going to Anyway., POST BODY: Hey,

My name is Dori and I just don't give a fuck anymore. I've got some serious chronic pain issues and am on 5mg of Methadone, and 5mgs of Oxycodone 4x/day. It sucks, I'm hanging on by my fingernails in terms of how much pain I'm in and my doctors are dumb as shit. I go to the ER 2-4x/month and get treated inhumanely. Seriously. Want to dehumanize yourself? Go to the ER and talk to condescending Doctors and Nurses. 

I'm seriously considering taking to the streets and buying my own drugs, because I need relief. I hate it that I'm stuck in this position. I didn't choose this at all.

So shut the fuck up. If your snooping my post history and disgusted by this seven words for you: **GO SHOVE A POLE UP YOUR ASS!***

I'm nice and sweet but people sometimes really irritate me. Anyway, with all that said I've been lurking for a bit &amp; finally decided to post. 

Sincerely,

Dori., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/225pkd/can_i_introduce_myself_fuck_it_im_going_to_anyway/

TITLE: Tolerance Break, POST BODY: Hey,

So I'm managing a chronic pain condition &amp; I've noticed I've built tolerance. I'm on:

* 5mg of Methadone @ 9am
* 5mg of Oxycodone IR @ 12pm &amp; 8pm
* 10mg of Oxycodone IR @ 4pm

Unfortunately I've noticed all of this not really managing my pain like it used to and instead of going to my doctors office and trying to increase the dosage, I'm considering a tolerance break. 

Obviously, if I have a break for longer than 3days, then I'm going to experience withdrawal symptoms. I was actually thinking to mitigate the withdrawal symptoms keep the methadone in place &amp; only break from the Oxy for a week. Is this a good plan? Or does it need fine tuning? What do you guys recommend?

I am aware that during the tolerance break I will probably have more pain but, thats a temporary price I'm willing to pay so my medications don't have to be increased.

Thanks so much!

TITLE: Tolerance Break First 24hrs..., POST BODY: Hey, 

So in case you were wondering I posted about wanting to start my Tolerance Break [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2372eb/tolerance_break/).

It has been the first 24hours and I've already failed. It was to no fault of my own. I got dizzy &amp; slipped down the stairs. I was so ill feeling after that, that we went down to the Emergency Room where they treated me for the fall &amp; my condition. 

I was put in an awkward position in terms of the narcotics at the ER. They asked about my pain and without me asking for pain medication, they just gave it to me. I don't mind it was a strong dose of 2mg of dialaudid. However,  I have a feeling this will screw up my tolerance break.

Oh well. At least this happened in the first 24hrs. Now I can start over &amp; try again.

*Sigh*

TITLE: Tolerance Break/Hospitalization &amp; Updates., POST BODY: Hey! So I was on a tolerance break, made it to day 3 which isn't bad, when I started vomiting like crazy. I was taken to the Emergency Room loaded up on IV Dialudid &amp; hospitalized. From there my specialist worked hard to help me with the pain. We went as far as getting an epidural to help control the pain &amp; go off the pain medication for another 4days. Unfortunately, I had a toxic reaction to the continuous epidural &amp; it had to be removed &amp; I was restarted on IV medications. 

From there I was scheduled for placement of a feeding tube which I now have &amp; then they moved me to oral medications. I'm now on:

* Methadone 5mg upon waking up
* Oxycodone 10mg Every 3hrs
* Dialudid 4mg Every 4hrs
* + An NSAID topical cream that has been helping the muscles spasms around the new feeding tube.

So I really got chewed up &amp; spit out with this tolerance break. I'm hoping from here things get a lot better. Especially since my medication regime is a lot stronger/better, I've been a lot more comfortable. Not only that but the tube is taking away my pancreatic pain. The only sucky part is that I can't eat anything/wont be able to eat anything for the next 6weeks at least. 

So yah. That's how things are., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/241va7/tolerance_breakhospitalization_updates/

TITLE: Withdrawing from Pain Medications - Successfully!, POST BODY: Hey! So my pain from pancreas has decreased dramatically due to the placement of a feeding tube. As a result I've been working closely with my pain doctor to reduce the amount of pain medications I'm on since I'm not experiencing as much - if any pain.

The only caveat to this whole process is that I am strictly tube fed. I do not intake any food by mouth.

However 4weeks ago I was on:

* 4mg of Dialudid 2x/day total of 8mg
* 5mg of Oxycodone 6x/day total of 30mg
* 5mg of Methadone 1x/day total of 5mg

Now today I am only on:

* 5mg of Methadone 1x/day total of 5mg

&amp; on Monday this week I swap down to 2.5mg of Methadone for a week before swapping to 2.5mg of Methadone once every other day for a week &amp; then nothing.

I am super proud of myself and have experienced limited withdrawal symptoms because of the slow method we have used to move me off the drugs.

So YAY! :-).

TITLE: Withdrawing from Methadone 5mg to 2.5mg to 1.25mg and apparently it is a bear., POST BODY: Hey Guys!

So, you all are probably gonna laugh and only clicked on here to tell me that, "I shouldn't be having withdrawals jumping off from that little of methadone," yet here I am having fucking withdrawals. So, I really don't know what to tell you naysayers who say I shouldn't be feeling anything except that 5mg was the highest dose of Methadone I ever took (chronic pain patient currently in remission) 

Last night I was going on night 3 of absolutely no sleep. It was horrible. I had a very runny nose, I was agitated, my joints ached, I was hot and cold all the same time I was on day 2 of not having any Methadone in my body and it was sucking really badly. My last dose had been 1.25 about 30hrs ago. 

Finally 5am rolls around and my roommate is going practically insane with me keeping her up so many days. I think she was experiencing sleep derivation symptoms at this point, so I break down and call my parents, they always tell me I can call anytime. Well fucking A I call and get yelled at but still leave my apartment to go to  their house - I take a cab. 

When I arrive I get yelled at more, "WHAT!? NOW YOU'RE HERE TO KEEP US UP!? DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE AND TRY TO SLEEP! FOR CRYING OUTLOUD!" I get it they were spooked when the houseline rang in the middle of the night. They expected something really horrible to be going on and I think they have PTSD from my brother's death a little bit. Since apparently someone was trying to call the house when they discovered his body, so it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that they're sensitive to the phone ringing.

However, they always said I could "CALL ANYTIME, EVEN IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT!" and their reaction today makes me never want to call again and just avoid using their help. Especially since I got chastised all day for calling at 5am.

Moving on I decided at the 38 hr mark to call my physician because the withdrawals were crazy bad. He devised a new withdrawal plan and put me on 1.25mg of Methadone every day until I feel better with an addendum that if I can't get to sleep tonight and/or tomorrow night that I could take 0.5mg of Ativan to help.

So here I am, readjusting to the methadone and still experiencing horrific symptoms of withdrawals. I'm expecting/hoping to sleep soon. But as it stands the current plan is to be on 1.25mg till I feel better and withdrawals go away and then to go to 1.25mg every other day for a week and then after that week jump off completely. the oncall doctor promised if I do it like that withdrawals would be better and since I need to function for the next few days and don't want to tolerate 2weeks worth of this withdrawal crapola I am sticking to his plan.

Thanks for listening.

I don't even know. 

I'm on pain pills for a chronic illness. My doctor has been weening me off them. i got off all the Oxycodone on my own and just had to get off 1.25mg of methadone. It was great. Until this past Tuesday. I got pancreatitis again &amp; just like that I was hooked back onto the oxycodone. Mind you I'm still recovering from super painful shit. However, I'm sick of this back and forth and rebound pain I get from the narcs. I'm now at 1.25mg of methadone every other day and expect to be off it soon but the oxy is going to take more time now.

This back and forth is driving me batty. I'm wondering if I need to go to rehab or a detox program just to really get sober and maybe learn how to deal with attacks without major narcotics.

I just don't know anymore.

TITLE: Withdrawing from Methadone Day 4 going on 5, POST BODY: So, I tried to jump off about two weeks ago from a 2.5mg dose and had to go back on it. Now, I am jumping off again and it hasn't been easy. I jumped off at 1.25 and for the first 2 days it was at least manageable. Then yesterday, day 3 I flipped a  lid. 

Every bone in my body hurt and to make things worse I was experiencing auditory hallucinations. Mind you I'm prone to those so it wasn't that much of a surprise and I'm proud of my parents for helping me make it though the night. It sure wasn't easy with all my shenanigans. 

I apparently from what I'm told I dialed 911 twice and my parents spoke to the operator and said I was fine. Apparently they weren't too happy with 2 calls from my household and did not come out.

Ultimately I'm glad because I didn't end up wasting a week of my life at the hospital and am a lot better today but getting through last night was absolute murder between the bone pain and auditory hallucinations.

However, I have parents who love me dearly and they both slept next to me and kept rubbing my body to help the bone pain and to soothe me. So they are kinda awesome.

It sucks having this disability and when my parents no longer exist I will have to go to the hospital but right now I understand they are here for me and can help me greatly.

Right now I'm looking into an IOP and just getting back ontrack. The hallucinations are gone and the withdrawals and becoming less and less severe. Although god damn bone pain is the worst.

Anyway it is day 4 going on day 5 and the hallucinations are gone.The bones still hurt but I figure once I sleep that'll go away - we'll see and overall I'm starting to feel better. So yah its hell going off even at this little of a dose /u/Timmisiewicz but it is possible and I don't anticipate it lasting more than 1week., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/27ody9/withdrawing_from_methadone_day_4_going_on_5/

TITLE: Finally Off the Methadone and Oxycodone ツ, POST BODY: So my last dose of Methadone was the 22nd of May and my last Oxycodone dose was Friday the 20th of June. I did have to take some Oxycodone on Tuesday the 24th of June due to a Gastroinstinal bleed that was causing pain and then on Thursday the 26th of June around 1am I was treated in the ER for the bleed and they gave me Dilaudid but, I feel like Tuesday/Thursdays uses were warranted.

It is now Saturday and my Gastrointestinal symptoms are under control and so is the pain. (last real pain med dose was Wednesday night/early Thursday morning) I still have bad abdominal pain, but I'm learning to breathe/be off the narcotics with it. I'm slowly but surely noticing improvements.

The methadone withdrawals were intense and triggered some psychotic issues for me but I managed to stay home and was able to deal with it. Then came the oxycodone withdrawals and I swear the biggest thing with that was my runny nose for days on end. Right now I'm just on a muscle relaxant and Tylenol and it seems to be pretty much doing the job.

Anyway, just wanted to share my story in case anyone could relate/was going off stuff themselves while in chronic pain. It is possible to get clean and not use narcotics everyday and more as a rescue medication. So yah. xD., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/29cyqs/finally_off_the_methadone_and_oxycodone_ツ/

This doctor treats patients with pain issues specifically with Suboxone. He also works with a few Heroin addicts as well, but it is not a clinic, it is a doctors office where this is his specialty and he's an internist.

I have chronic abdominal pain from a rare bile duct disorder (It's kinda like Crohns with a ton of pancreatitis episodes)....

The doctor obviously gave me a lot of information but I was wondering if anyone here is on it for pain or knows someone who is/was on it for pain and what happened with them? What kind of pain condition was/is present and if there's EXTRA pain or "FLARES" how does Suboxone work/help?

Later on the first one that he missed caught up with the dose that he got right and it slowed his respiratory rate and eventually caused him to die. The coroner said, *"I just don't understand, he had barely enough to kill himself with it. This should not have happened."* He died alone upstairs in his room.

**He was my younger brother dead at 20 and I was left hopeless at 22**. We never knew he was on Heroin. We never knew what was happening or how deep into drugs he really was. We thought at best he was into Cannabis and a few pills here and there. We thought it was all manageable. We were wrong.

I'll never forget that day finding out. Or the fact that the night he died was the night of my parents 23rd wedding anniversary.

Just a reminder to stay safe out there. Just stay safe.

*Edit 10/24/14 @ 5pm PST: I just wanted to say thank yo so much to everyone for your amazing well wishes. If anything comes of this it serves as a great reminder to be careful out there. Also if you want to get clean then I recommend it highly. There is nothing more unfortunate than losing your life to your drug addiction.

TITLE: Almost A Month Off Of Oxycodone And I'm Still Having Severe Pain!, POST BODY: Hey,

So all my doctors promised me, "You'll be so much better off the oxycodone," "You'll have less pain," "You'll be able to use the restroom better," "It's just going to be better."

Honestly speaking it is not better whatsoever. I am having extreme pain every night. It only gets worse as the day wears on and that idea that my constipation was due to the oxycodone is so false. As of Yesterday, I hadn't had a bowel movement for four days. Ended up needing two Enemas to clear myself out. 

I'm dealing with a lot of severe issues and being off the pain medication is just not okay with me. I don't know what to do. At all. I'm seeing a new pain doctor who is considering Fentanyl for me. However, due to the fact that a day after signing into contract with him I ended up in the ER and required pain medication - apparently that is forbidden. So, now I have an appointment later on this month where I will just be grateful if this doctor doesn't kick me out of his clinic. When what I really need out of that visit is something to manage my pain. 

This has become suffering and I'm not sure if I can handle it. At all. I feel very dejected and down. This isn't easy. Especially dealing with such severe pain issues.

I don't know what to do with it anymore. I just feel really down and sad., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2lqho1/almost_a_month_off_of_oxycodone_and_im_still/

TITLE: Suboxone Gone Horribly Wrong. (Pain Management Issue), POST BODY: I know what you're thinking, another "woe is me," post. I'm just really pissed at the moment.

I finally decided to try Suboxone and go with the Suboxone doctor and most likely will get kicked out of my current pain clinic because of it. I'm so pissed because Suboxone did not work. Well correction it did work for my pain, but I had a bad reaction to it. 

I decided to be safe and take it in my Suboxone doctors office after much agonizing over weather or not to take it in the first place. After taking it I was good for a good 30minutes. I mean completely fine, the pain issue was really solved at least I thought... Then, I got up for a bit and was fine then too. Just tired. So, the doctor says, "If you were going to have any ill effects it would've happened by now. You're good to go home, sleep and call me when you wake up so I can monitor your dosage and such." 

So, just as I'm leaving my last thought was, "I need to tell reception that I'll pay at my next appointment on Friday because, I am super tired." Well instead of saying that to reception apparently I started shaking uncontrollably and passed out over the front of the reception desk and then fell backwards. I had blacked out. I did not have a seizure but I completely fainted from the suboxone. There was this horrific ringing in my ears and everything was very muffled as I came to after about a full two minutes of being out cold. 

Then, I went to my Gastro doctor appointment and explained what happened with the Suboxone and he tells me at this point there is no physical cause for my pain and that I must be psychosomatic or drug seeking. 

He sends me for a Psychiatric evaluation through the Emergency Room. So I go and get a psychiatric evaluation. It is my medical doctors opinion that my depression is causing my pain and that if that was under control I would have less pain and be better. 

However, after being evaluated by psychiatry they said that my pain was ill-managed and if that was better managed I would probably be a lot better physically. That I have a feeding tube and that, that in and of itself can be painful ontop of my disorder which is just known to be painful. So, I don't know what my Gastro doctor is on about and I'm really close to firing him and getting a new Gastro doctor.

So, they discharged me and right now I feel very Shit out of Luck. I'll have to make some calls but I'll probably get kicked out of my pain clinic for going down the Suboxone route and I'm not welcomed at my old pain clinic that recommended I go try Suboxone, apparently the doctor there said something along the lines of, "Sorry suboxone didn't work for you, it was just a suggestion. I can no longer help you." and I'm most likely going to be kicked out of my current pain clinic for accepting the Suboxone doctor's help since that would be a breech of the contract I should have never signed late in October when I was still deciding what to do in terms of my pain management. 

Now I feel royally screwed and have no idea what to do. Any help would be much appreciated. 

I would post this to /r/ChronicPain but, I got banned from that subreddit because, I have a posting history here in /r/opiates and was apparently "doctor shopping," so they didn't want to expose their community to the likes of me. I'm not angry about being banned from /r/ChronicPain - I'm just referencing it so no one here suggests I post there.

BODY: WOOPS! I thought I had mentioned what happened after the blackout...

My Suboxone doctor rushed out apparently from the back office and caught me when I fell. He called my name and got me to come back. I was super sleepy afterwards and ended up sleeping in his office for 2hrs after the event before I insisted on getting home to sleep. I ended up vomiting uncontrollably at home and had to be treated at the ER for nausea/vomiting/headache/migraine. I was discharged from the ER with a recommendation to stay the fuck away from Suboxone.

&gt;Also, are you no longer welcomed to the suboxone doctor anymore? 

No. My Suboxone doctor is great. He even guided me back onto Tramadol correctly even though it was only one dose of Suboxone, I started experiencing withdrawal symptoms and it sucked. So the tramadol has helped at least in that regard and its doing something for my pain although, it's not doing too much for my pain...

It's the doctor before that, that I am no longer welcomed to see. She insisted I go ahead and try Suboxone, and then when I tried it and it went badly there was a hope I could go back to her as a doctor however she stated that it was only a recommendation and could no longer help me at all. 

It may have been a reaction to Nalaxone, it was a 2mg/0.5 strip - I'm not willing to take any suboxone product again though *"just to find out,"* doesn't seem worth it.

BODY: &gt;If you had pain management and treatment, why would you go to a suboxone doctor? You pain doctor could have prescribe subxone.

My pain management doctor discharged me with a referral to try suboxone and gave me two doctors phone numbers. I called both and then went to see one of those referrals. There was a hope that after the suboxone did not work for me that I could go back and see her but, she has since stated the the suboxone was only a recommendation and she's sorry it didn't work for me but, could not help me anymore.

&gt;What was the pain clinic prescribing to you that you want to switch to suboxone?

At my prior pain clinic baby dose of 20mg of Oxycodone in one day taking at the intervals of 5mg/10mg/5mg to manage my pain - although looking back I think she suspects I was abusing my script, even though I've never abused my script.

&gt;What dose of suboxone did you take?

I took the lowest dosage possible in the dissolving strip. 2mg/0.5mg


*edit: I also currently had pain management with a new pain doctor that I signed a contract with (stupidly) while I was still determining if I'd go down the suboxone route. Ended up going down the suboxone route and it didn't work out for me. So, now I'm pretty much screwed with the new pain doctor/clinic.*

&gt;  It sounds like your pain doctor was trying to get rid of you

Yep. Pretty much... she needed a way to get rid of me and I honestly think one of the reasons she suggested I see a Suboxone doctor to script me it for pain was not because she couldn't do it herself but, because she wanted to get rid of me.

&gt;you just have to find a new doctor. I know it sucks, but we live in a world where doctors are very hesitant to prescribe opiate for chronic pain.

Yah. I got to a point where  I was pretty hopeless and then I went to the ER for that psychiatric evaluation and it was really validating and moreover they gave me a referral to a new pain clinic.... so we'll see on Monday if that works.

&gt;Clearly you are in need, and nobody seems to really care, just passing the buck. 

Seriously. It's quite aggravating. I'm very frustrated with "the system" so to speak. Although it was validating at my psychiatric evaluation in the ER to **not** be admitted to the psychiatric ward and to be told that my pain is probably causing my depression and not the other way around. So, we'll see what happens in regards to that because, they wrote me referral to a pain management clinic; however, I just don't know if the clinic will take me since most of my doctors are affiliated with another hospital.... we'll see....

BODY: It's a little more insane than that. It's basically, "We know whats wrong with you, you have X disorder! We treated you by placing in a feeding tube. You have been fixed. You no longer have pain." gee. thanks doc. I didn't realize you were such an expert on how my body even feels with a foreign object sticking outta it 24/7.....

Anyway........I'll probably be firing this doctor eventually but he's like my 3rd GI and its difficult to get people to take on my case. So that's pretty much it. 

In other news, my current pain clinic ended up not firing me. At all. They just said I was a very difficult case and it had a lot of complexities and that I was simply going off little information &amp; following a referral. They did say my reaction to Suboxone, was bizarre. I only described what happened and the doctor was like, "what in the world would cause you to seize or faint like that?!" apparently he knows a thing about Suboxone too, and their clinic has the proper licensing for it. This was also never made clear to me. So, yep. There goes that.

They did swap my Lyrica to Gabapentin and refilled my Tramadol. I have an appointment in just less than 4weeks to see my doctor again. So hopefully, that combination of drugs the Gabapentin + Tramadol does something, because I figure the Tramadol might be keeping my pain at an 8/10 vs. a 10/10 so - that's that doing something. Even if it's a little bit and Lyrica was treating pain I never knew I had in my joints - like I didn't realize that tight inflexible feeling in your fingers was anything abnormal until I took Lyrica for the first time and it pretty much evaporated. So... maybe since Gabapentin takes a different direction to the same receptors Lyrica treats, then maybe something will go better for me with my abdominal pain because, there are a ton of nerves in your GI tract. So time will only tell.

BODY: I would assume plugging is just as effective. I have a feeding tube that goes to my small bowel. Every time I've crushed up past scripts of Oxycodone, it felt like I was getting an IV shot of dialudid. Also, same effect with benadryl. So, from that sense, I would assume going in the other end works just as well. You could always test it out with a smaller dose and see if you even feel any of it. So you don't waste your dope but you can get a sense for it. Also you can always take more later you can never take less once you've put it into your system.

I also am a needy patient or was with my original pain doctor. I think though she wasn't  giving me the dosages I needed to be comfortable and that contributed to my neediness.

TITLE: Today is the Anniversary of my Younger Brother's Death. He died in 2010. A Reminder to Be Safe., POST BODY: Hey Bropiates,

I lost my younger brother 4years ago at 10pm tonight it is estimated he died on November 29th in 2010. He passed on from a heroin overdose and was discovered on November 30th dead, alone and stone cold by my dad and then my mother. I am thankful that I was living away from home at the time and did not witness that scene.

The night he died I gained 20 sorority sisters as I was inducted into my college sorority, but I lost my brother. It's creepy thinking about it and inductions in fall were always hard for me in college. Now as an adult, I make my way around life but, I will never forget my brother. 

I posted about [his birthday](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2k5ri0/in_about_an_hour_and_a_half_we_always_counted_our/) just a few months ago. He was 20 when he died. I want this to serve as a reminder that the Thanksgiving Holidays are rough and dealing with family is typically not easy, just be safe out there, especially as the holiday winds down. If anyone needs someone to talk to or just listen, feel free to PM me. I care.

Sincerely,

Dori

PS: Today is also my parents 27th Wedding Anniversary. I love them so much and find it amazing that they have been able to stay together even after the fallout from loosing my brother... So just wishing them well right now.

EDIT: I love this community your well wishes, condolences and messages have all made this very emotional day bearable. My mom broke down in tears this morning in his memory, dad had a meltdown and yelled about finances as a cover for his distraught emotions and then my parents argued over going to dinner and trying to enjoy themselves. I *think* they are going to go out together. We'll see. There were good moments today too. We played in the yard with the dog &amp; he swam in the pool with my mother, then a flower basket that I had ordered arrived for my parents. So all-in-all it was a good day.

BODY: Thank You so much for this. It was just Heroin. Barely enough to kill him - according to the coroner. It is suspected earlier in the day he might've missed a vein and then later on, got the right vein and then that night the two injections caught up with his system and slowed his respiratory and he just collapsed and passed away. It's any parents worst nightmare to walk in on that scene thinking their son was just sleeping in late.

There is a possibility it was suicide too... however, I think my brother was suicidal but the night he died was not his intended night.

I honestly don't mind being that ear for people. I'm sorry you've been through hell and back with your girlfriend too. Try to stay calm throughout the process of her accusing you of hurting her. It will help your case when people ask about it. &amp; you are right that is very low, rude, and in my opinion obnoxious because, it gives more reason to not believe those who has really been hurt by their significant other. Also don't feel bad about being angry about this - find a way to express that anger - go ahead punch a pillow. I just recommend you don't express it in front of anyone if you can help it. Ya know? That's my 2cents for what its worth.

&lt;3 also losing your two uncles and friends is never easy whether it is a death or just a loss - grief is a terrible thing. It hurts all around.  Thinking of you ... :-).

How is everyone doing this fantastic Sunday morning? I've got my shit together with an awesome cup of coffee and feel like chatting to some awesome peoples (you).

So anyway, if you don't know me - I'm Dori. I've got a feeding tube and my doctors aren't great. Which has resorted to me using an old back supply of opiates but I have to be clean for 10days prior to my pain doctor appointments for drug testing. I know I can go less but I need to be 100% clean and they lab test it so I leave 10days as a good buffer every month + it helps my tolerance.

Anyway talk soon! Tell me something interesting about you!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2tmwsg/good_sunday_morningafternoon/

BODY: Hey Scott!

I'm 26. It's a true nightmare. I've been dealing with this shit since I was 23 or at least I was diagnosed at 23. I've suffered my entire life with it. The pain is incredible. 

It really knocks me out. This past Monday the pain was so  bad that not even what I had at home could help. Ended up in the emergency room followed by a 3day hospital stay. I seem to be averaging ER once a month and hospitalizations once every three months. Which if you can believe is an improvement. I used to spend 3weeks out of the month in the hospital and/or ER. 

Chronic pancreatitis is such a bitch + I have bile duct issues that doesn't help. 

&gt;  I would totally offer you some bags 

Thanks so much :-) that's a nice thought. However, I refuse to get into heroin, because I can't take the risk of ending up dead because of a bad cut or something. My younger brother died when I was 22. He was 20. Being the only one left I can't die - I just can't do that to my parents. Not until they're gone at least. On that note I don't know what would happen if something happened to mom &amp; dad. I'd flip my shit. 

In any case - shit aint easy and I agree that I deserve some relief. I'm hoping things come together for me :-)... just hopeful that they do.

TITLE: Bad Vs. Good News, POST BODY: Hey Guys!!!

So, the bad news first:

I had a super discouraging doctors appointment. He was way overly judgmental. Saying shit like that my ER Visit was not a good thing and that he understands I'm in pain but that I need to work through going to the ER. I pointed out that it had been 6weeks since I last visited the hospital and last time I stayed for 2days and this time I left the ER after 12hrs so that was an improvement from this time last year when I was in the ER like weekly. 

It just pissed me off because he told me to be great its not about what you have achieved but its about what you're going to achieve. Which my mom liked, for whatever reason, but I hated it. Because, I have come so far and I have done really well and I have followed his lead (for the most part). He wasn't my doctor a year ago when things were horrid so I don't think he realizes what a huge accomplishment this was for me.

Also, he bitched about my weight for a long ass time because, I guess the high triglyceride levels in my body from sudden weight gain can contribute to my pancreatic pain. (I've gained about 30lbs in 3months). So, he lectured me quite a bit. I took it with stride - I've struggled with my weight for most of my young adult life so now that I'm in my mid-twenties - I know all about it &amp; the simple equation to loose weight. I get it. I have no excuse my caloric intake is perfectly measured to the last small calorie because of my feeding tube. &amp; I just need to actually work out vs. just walking the dog leisurely. He wants me to work up a sweat 15minutes per day but that so is not going to happen at least not anytime soon. He claimed my current regime with the dog is for like 60-80year olds and that I'm 25 so I should be doing more. *Should've, Would've, Could've,* I mean REALLY!?

Anyway, now good news:

I was able to get a back supply of my stuff. My guy got it to me in an exceptionally fast manner and put me on the honor system fronting me just a small amount (which, I have since paid up). So, that was excellent. So, even though my pain doctor wont help narcotic wise - I'm at least covered for the next 20 days before I have to do withdrawals etc., to pass my drug test at my stupid pain doctors office next time. 

&amp; In other news my pain doctor did put me on topamax (aka dopeamax because, it gives you brain fog), and that helps with weightloss + pain typically migraine type pain which could help my small headaches and potentially my pancreatic pain - we will see. So that's good. Not only that but I got my supply of celebrex too, so with starting that we should see a difference pain wise. *fingers crossed!!!*

He also mentioned that my weight gain could be partially due to the increase in Lyrica so having the topamax to combat that will be super useful.

In other good news - my boyfriend bought a plane ticket out to see me again in May &amp; him + me might meet up in Vegas in April so all of that stuff is good and exciting.

Overall, my quality of life has drastically improved and I'm just so happy about that. It's just hard dealing with the severe daily pain, but like I said at least I'm covered till my next drug test. For those wondering why I take 10days to withdraw vs. 3 or 5 is to leave buffer room for slipping up and needing something within the first 5days and then I have an extra 5days to just be clean + it helps with keeping my tolerance in check and not only that it is financially beneficial so yah. yep. It sucks but it works!

Just felt like sharing iono. Didn't expect to write so freaking much. Anyway stay beautiful /r/opiates!!!

xxx,

I said I had been but I had been seeing Dr. Anaberg there &amp; the whole suboxone disaster went down and I was discharged from the clinic. So this unsent letter come after my very well respected blood doctor phones up Dr. Shamson and leaves a voicemail stating:

&gt;Hey I've got Dori here she may have seen you in the past for nerve blocks through the hospital. She was a patient of Dr. Anabergs but undetermined reasons care was discontinuned. She is now seen by somone in the community and her pain is ill managed. I do not think she is manipulative in the least if that is a concern she is very genuine.

After leaving the voicemail he turned to me and told me that Dr. Shamson likes him and if I had any problems to come back to his offices and he would make calls.

So ya. I don't know. I just don't. We'll see. Monday morning will be very telling.

BODY: Ya. This doctor seems to especially like me and sympathsizes with my situation. I'm something different for him. I'm vibrant and young and someone he can really help. He deals with a lot of elderly cancer patients or a lot of young cancer patients that are terminal and its just sad... he also does iron infusions for patients who need them occasionally, but I think I come to him as a unique challenge because there aren't very many people in my position. 

He told me back in November that he never wanted me to feel abandoned. I took that to heart so, I opened up this time to him.  Since, I've been struggling again.

I'm very nervous this Monday to call the pain clinic - might call his office to see if Dr. Shamson got back to him first, and see what was said we'll see... It's just important because I can't continue like this.

In the meantime I see my current pain doctor in the community on Tuesday and I'm hoping to god he prescribes something that will actually work and gives up this who idea of "protecting me from my brother's addiction"  its just assenine.

BODY: To answer your initial question:

&gt;How to talk to my little brother without being hypocritical?

You don't. You approach him from a very honest place. You don't say I know I did blah blah blah, **BUT** you need to - saying "but" like is akin to saying "That's nice and all; let me tell you waht I really think now..." There is no BUT. 

With that said, you can use and statements even if they oppose each other - its some trippy stuff but if you do it right and approach him calmly he'll see you are not judging him for his usage and you are trying to help him; that you are not out to get him and you wish the best for him.

Best of luck to you. Hopefully he understands he's out of control and needs some kind of help!

I developed a sore throat around 7pm and for some reason no matter what I do I can't get comfy enough to get to sleep. It is now almost 3:30am and I haven't slept a wink. I'm a bit worried because I have a 10:30am appointment and my day is go, go, go from then till 3 in the afternoon. Ugh. FML. I'm not withdrawing from anything or even currently using. 

I seriously hope I'm not coming down with some kind of strange sore throat. It is the last thing I need just after I was starting to feel better emotionally and everything.

I even took a bit of Ativan and it didn't knock me out. Ugh. Maybe just the stress about all the crap with my medical stuff is finally eating at me bad enough to keep me up all night that along with the soreness of my throat and the runny tummy I have from the antibiotic just has me screwed up.

BODY: I am in the same boat basically. My condition is bad enough that they feel I require a feeding tube and require me to not have been eating for the past two years and I wont be eating anytime in the forseeable future. However, when it comes to using narcotics for managing my pain all my doctors are up in arms about it. My pain specialist has flat out said he will work with me hollistically but he will never script me a narcotic. He rather I hassle with the ER than have me take a script at home. Even if I had a limited script for just the breakthrough pain. Sometimes I think he's a bit dense. Like just because I had a script at home doesn't mean I'd stop working on things hollistically. He's treating it as if it's all or nothing. I had an ER doctor early last week tell me flat out that I need to:

&gt;Just live the rest of your life in pain or die of an opiate addiction.

FunFUCKINGtastic. Really. just glorious. 

It's so assbackwards, these doctors think they're protecting patients. Mine certainly thinks he's protecting me from an opiate addiction, what he's doing is damaging the quality of my life putting unrealistic expectations on me and just creating a black &amp; white picture that makes absolutely no sense. 

If you want to vent or say more - trust me, trust me, trust me while I'm not you I at least can really, really, really sympathize with it all.

TITLE: So Angry I Don't Know What to do with Myself., POST BODY: HALP!

I'm not normally an angry person. Tell me about you. Anything about you. I need some sincere distracting from this crap. My old pain clinic has jaded the view of all my other reputable doctors and it has left me in the dust in regards to getting treatment. 

No wonder my GI a few months back thought I needed to go to the psychward and get evaluated, which I did and they told my GI if my pain was better managed I wouldn't be a psych case anymore, and my GI had me take that inforamtion to my new pain doctor who told me that the psych people just were passing the buck on me. That he cared. So he offered a few things to try and I have been giving them an honest shot.

Everytime I walk into my current pain doctors office he tells me about how I'm too high risk for addiction, how because of everything I've been through, I'm just too high of a risk and I was assuming he meant my brother... he told me to go to an AA meeting or an NA meeting this last visit....

I reacted by telling him that I thought it'd make me really sad to remember my brother like that and I'd think about it. 

It wasn't till I was home thinking about it that I picked up the phone and found out I had been dismissed from my old pain clinics care. I wasn't simply discharged from my old pain doctor I was dismissed. I asked what the difference was and was finally told that it was on record I had broken my pain contract.

I explained, I was *discharged*, with a referral to try suboxone offlabel , ***for pain,*** and that the doctor then never mentioned anything about breaking my pain contract. That I was never told I had done this, that it did take me awhile to go ahead and try the subxone because, it was a "scary" drug for me and that I had seizure on it and informed their offices of said seizure and was told it was merely a suggestion to go ahead and try suboxone and that they could no longer help me. 

That whatever was in their notes about the way I was discharged or what had happened has been negatively impacting the way I receive care in the ER is truly traumatic and that I've been struggling day in and day out for a long 6months off all narcotics with the exception of 7 ER visits and 3 Hospitalizations in 6 months. 

Sadly, that is the lowest number of hospital encounters in recent times than ever before....

They seemed surprised that I haven't had a script at home since August. Said, they'd look into it further and would get back to me. I'm just hurt. Really hurt and hurting.

I'm just so blood boiling angry. I don't know. Tell me about you., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/331kqi/so_angry_i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_myself/

BODY: &gt; The story u told must not be the whole story behind u getting the boot from ur pain clinic. 

Nope. That's exactly it. It was back August. I had just successfully gotten off the Methadone at this doctor's discretion - she put me on it and then she took me off all in 6months. 

I was struggling with the pain after a month out of being off of the methadone. I had been simultaneously working on getting off the oxycodone but getting off the Oxycodone along with the methadone at the exact same time was putting undue stress on my body.

So after seeing this she told me to continue to take the just like I had always had - and refilled my script of 10mgs or 5mg twice a day. My 2nd to last visit with her, everything seemed fine and I was on 5mg of oxycodone 2x/day for no more than 10mgs of oxy per day and she wanted to keep it status quo however I was having a lot of pain still and there was a huge gap in my day around 3pm where I'd become non-functional. So I asked if it would make sense to increase by 5mg to have 3x/day coverage...she decided that would be fine and wrote for 5mg 3x/day.

Well anyway, I went ahead and saw her as scheduled again 3 weeks later and she sat me down and told me "Listen, I know you are struggling. You have such a unique situation. I have a patient from 10years ago who was just in so much pain, and would have a lot of stool issues from the opiates - she ended up taking suboxone and it was the miracle drug for her pain. I think it could really work for you. I am going to refer you out to this doctor who specializes in Suboxone for pain." she then wrote me a two month supply of my oxycodone in case I had trouble getting into an appointment with this new doctor and I was to update her on how it went but should be very happy under his care.

The ER visits that would be in question came after the boot from the pain clinic. Under my current doctors watch but he's not scripting me any narcotics so I'm not in contract with him. Any and every ER visit under my previous doctor were not outside of her contract and I was very clear with her and transparent about the terms of the contract and what was happening with ER visits as they occured.

BODY: &gt;If the question is, how do i get guaranteed painkillers from the ER, thats a pretty good answer.

That wasn't the question. At all. 

Sure. It's a good answer. If that was the question. To get painkillers yes, its a great idea if you were really hurting and that desperate and dope sick, yes. However, that was NOT the question.

&gt;It sucks people think so little of opiate addicts on this sub that you feel the need to clarify this is a bad idea.

It doesn't need to be clarified because, I feel and think so little of opiate addicts on this subreddit that I must tell everyone self-injury is harmful. I do not appreciate you stuffing words into my mouth.

It needs to be clarified, because it has all the ingredients for something to go horribly wrong, everything it getting infected to it becoming a horrible habit that is just as addictive as the percs, to the ER refusing to write you a script for what you thought you were going to get, to all sorts of other nasty things. 

I'm sorry you dislike the fact that I believe your "How-To" is a bad tutorial/advice. 

&gt;So not only is this a sure fire way to get pills, its a great motivator for getting clean.

Uh just because you have an ancedote of it working for a friend of yours where it lead to his 5month and counting sobriety (Sincere Congratulations to Him!), does not make it a sure fire way to get pills. The only sure things in life are TAXES and DEATH. Everything else, anything can happen.

BODY: Oh good gwad. We got off on the wrong foot. 

Bottomline, ya you struck a nerve with me. I can 100% own up to that. I care deeply about this community and have spent countless hours talking to members here learning your stories and hanging around tinychat. So, when someone comes around shouting that I don't give a shit - I'm gonna give them some shit for it. Especially since I have absolutely nothing to do either. I'm stuck at home all day today getting nutrition.

I have my own issues with drugs. I hold no judgement. Every story is unique and different and relative to what the person has experienced. 

As far as your very first comment striking a real nerve - that happened for two reasons and I speak only for myself (1) I've been cut free for fun for 8 years now and (2) This subreddit is meant to promote harm reduction - not encourage it. So yah. There's that. 


I'm so sincerely sorry you found my extra comment about using a razor like that to be not a good idea insulting; however, I feel strongly that sometimes when people are in a state seeing an opposing view to something that would normally be common sense can slow down the thought process and prevent a person from doing something he or she will later regret.

When you're upset, when you're struggling, when you're dealing with something difficult and someone says, "yo do this harmful thing for X," you're not thinking about the longterm effects of it or any regrets you might have from it. You don't have the capacity in an overworked emotional state to recognize something like that as a bad decision especially when the potential reward is so greatly needed. 

This tends to cause people to get into situations where they take actions and then cannot handle the consequences or fallout of those actions later on. Thus, causing more problems in their lives than they wanted or even anticipated from doing such a "small" thing. 

Dunno. Just thoughts.

Does that make sense?

BODY: &gt;I get the feeling you've stopped being all that polite, let alone civil, with the staff and docs at these clinics because there is definitely a reason why they're being so difficult. 

I honestly don't know. I generally have a solid #1 Rule "No yelling at staff/nurses" because they are only following procedure.

I tend to vent a lot more violently here than I am when I go into their office... I'm kinda at a dispparing loss. I think I come into these appointments looking more like an empty shell than anything. I'm up for anything, they say jump and I "go how high?" I've kept detailed pain logs in the past that included notes on what was happening with me both emotionally and physically only to have them sparingly glanced at. I stopped keeping them because I would be upset everynight at seeing no progress. 

When I asked the first pain clinic originally why I was "discharged" I was told that it was because the doctor felt there was nothing more she could do for me and was sorry suboxone didn't work out. 

At this pain clinic the reason for not starting me on a narcotic has been that I have a strong family history of addiction, case in point that my younger brother died of a Heroin Overdose. He keeps telling me that "no, you have too strong of a family history for me to put you on anything." and its very WTFish the vibe I'm getting from this particular doctors office though is that he's doing the same to other patients. My last visit I could hear a lady screaming through the walls about her pain and him trying desperately to tell her it was for her own good and saftey. 

I don't doubt I've been blacklisted. I'm not an idoit. I just don't know what I did to get blacklisted. No one ever said, "you broke the contract and now we're dismissing you." they just lead me to suboxone which genuniely didn't work for me. 

I'm going to make a few more calls on Monday and depending on that I might hire a medical malpractice lawyer. I mean I've given this my all. I've even given up food. And that helped cut the ER visits down from bi-weekly to about monthly. 

I don't know. My #1 rule is no yelling and no cussing. I usually just ask questions, sometimes I cry, usually kinda quietly, and I make a plan - last month it was to shed 10lbs and I did that - this month its a goal to exercise 3x/week at a certain intensity which is in progress. I also work extensively with therapy, deep breathing, rewiring thought patterns through CBT and DBT and utalizing other methods of coping for deailing with the pain... and sometimes they help and other times they fall short. Doesn't mean I don't still try to use them. There's about 10 - 15times out of the month that I feel I could definitely be justified in going to the ER. out of those 10-15times I go 1-2 and then I get beatup for going those 1-2 when I could have just gone 10-15 and been nonstop...

&amp; believe it or not as draining as this situation is, its at least 50% better than it was 2years ago before I cut out food.

Also it never hurts to bump up your vitamin C &amp; D intake as well as maybe a good multivitamin. I don't know if it'll release the bad toxins faster but it might help you feel better sooner. Also exercise might help. If your up for it and can do it a 30minute sweat would get rid of the toxins too, just be sure to hydrate with water &amp; electrolytes.

BODY: wow. I would say stimulating her interests is essential as well as something to boost her self esteem and inner confidence... I talk about my younger brother a lot around these parts. He died 4years ago of a Heroin overdose after being clean from ages 16-18. When he turned 18 he said, "fuck it, being clean for me isn't working. I'm gonna kick it with my old using buddies and do what I want." he was dead 4years later. 

It's the cold hard truth that being sober after experiencing something like H is difficult. I cannot even begin to imagine the kind of stress or what that is like. 

I just know that for me when I get really depressed keeping things "real" or keeping myself grounded is super important. Doing things on a daily basis to live in positivity and change my thought patterns is super important. 

For instance skills such as:

* DEAR MAN (look it up)
* Opposite to Emotion Action
* Journaling
* Distraction Techniques
* CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)
* DBT (Dialectal Behavioral Therapy)

are really useful overall then when dealing with issues. I used to be a heavy cutter. I would self injure myself. It was a horrible addiction. I've been cut free for 9 years. I managed to do it by replacing my urges to cut with other activities. At first it was stupid, want to cut - listen to music, stupid music what that accomplish? Want to cut, write about it then! Blah that just makes me idolize cutting more! What is this useless bullshit!? Want to cut call a friend? I really don't care about how she can't find a boyfriend she's 17 for crying the fuck out loud.

But then something started happening - I stopped coming home and having thoughts to cut - I'd switch on the music, dial my best friend without skipping a beat and before I knew it it'd be dinner. I'd eat with the family have a passing thought about it but all of a sudden I had the control. I suddenly had power, I was able to just say "hey! go away!" and it just did. I'd get homework done (or not) and get to bed to do it all over again.

Another thing that was really useful to replace cutting with was, was that everytime I felt the urge or the thought was to either think up something I was grateful for it could be as superficial as I like the family dog or as deep as I wanted it be such as I love it that I have excellent insight. Not only did that help me not cut, it helped my mood &amp; self-esteem. 

I'd just replace "cut" in my story with "do heroin" in the case of your foster daughter. I realize it's definitely not EXACTLY the same so I would encourage you to take what applies to your situation and use it and what does not, well leave that at the door. To each his or her own ;-).

Hope Everyone is doing fantastic! Firstly, sincerely apologize; I know I've been posting a lot of negative crap about my medical stuff and that is just so upsetting, stressful and quite frankly accomplishes nothing but allows for an outlet to vent. 

Today, I just felt like talking about something that might be useful to the entire community. No matter where in this game you are I hope you can appreciate the idea behind this. Even if it just gets your brain thinking about how you can improve on other aspects of your life. 

Personally, I struggle with a lot of negative thoughts and anxiety. Especially considering the mountain I am ~~climbing~~ stuck under with my medical crapola. 

I've found that it doesn't always cut it to just breathe, listen to music or watch TV. Sometimes, I need to be a bit more proactive than that. 

Lately, I've been doing a thing.

Yes. **A thing.**

A thing where, I've come up with a mantra/saying/something to say. I actually have a few as follows as an example:

* Living in the past or future does nothing for me. Today is a gift taht is why it is called the present.
* I am beauty &amp; brains
* I stick by my values: Health, Family, Friends, Giving Back
* I refuse to be put in a box and labeled. 
* My identity is fluid. 
* Emotions change every 15minutes or so, lets see how I feel then.

I actually have them *written* down and posted in my kitchen!

The next step after I took some time to create this list that I could believe/buy into/understand/achieve, I went about my day normally, except when I'd catch myself thinking about "what a dumb fuck I am" I'd pause and take a deep breath before letting it really hurt me in that same moment of taking a breath I'd pull from my statement/affirmations and go, "I am beauty and brains"

BAM! POW! CHICAWOWOW! 

Instantaneous mood boost.  

So my challenge to you is to (1) Tell me (or not!) 1-3 mantras and/or sayings designed for you, that you believe you can actually use and be excited about using. (2) Do it once this weekend and just make a mental note on how you felt after you tried it. Did you go back to the situation/group? Did you feel empowered? (3) Write down anything from 1 word to thousands of pages focusing on what, why, when, how, where. 

Define yourself outside of being whatever it is that you dislike (or even do like). Just like I am not my physical illness you are not whatever issue is stressing you out at this very moment.

I don't know. I felt compelled to share this knowledge in hopes it helps - I know this type of thinking has gotten me through some pretty terrible days.

BODY: Yep. I too have severe depression issues. I'm actually diagnosed on the Schizoaffective spectrum, but have been told that I'm *exceptionally* high functioning "normal" for my diagnosis.I attribute it to a very deep knowledge of CBT, DBT, Positive Psychology, Will to Improve/Live (this took some time to develop) and finally striking it right with the perfect medication combination. 

If it weren't for both skill/talk therapy AND medication combined - I don't think I'd be as far along as I am right now.

That is why it frustrates me that for my pancreatitis/pain my doctors expect me to cure it by using my brain power/will power/mediation/skills. Like if I need a multipronged approach to beat my depression/schizoaffective what makes you think that I can think my way out of pain!?!? 

So yah. I guess, that is really what eats at me.

It's cool though. I'm really taking things slowly to make the right decision for myself and my own well being.

BODY: I honestly don't know enough about it. All I know is that's what happened to my brother he did a shot probably around 5pm &amp; missed. Then around 9 or 10pm he did a 2nd shot because he was probably 'still sick' and actually hit. By 10pm he was collapsed over the side of the bed only to be disvovered the next morning by our parents stone cold and dead. 

The corner is the one who explained that this is the most likely way he accidently overdosed based on the positioning on his most recent track marks &amp; toxicity reports that showed he barely had enough H in his system to kill him... that it was most likely a completely accidental overdose because of the missed shot.

BODY: Thanks. I can't tell you how much the condolences help. Even if it was almost 5years ago now. Doesn't hurt any less, but my coping skills for it have improved. That is why I am a huge advocate for safety with this shit. Especially when it comes to missed shots or someone getting overly confident/cocky with their addiction. (Not saying you fit this category).


I personally know very little about H - what I do know is because of my brother and just hearing things around here. I alway live by the rule of **you can more later you can never take less later.** 

My reasoning for being around these parts outside of being an advocate for safety is my own chronic pain issues that cause me to illicitly use opiates. 

The reason I say that is because that's the pure reason I use them, but it doesn't make me "better" or "legit" at the end of the day addiction doesn't differentiate between pain &amp; no pain etc., so I do have my own addiction to oxycodone.  This community is the best and has helped me immensely through some tough times. ❤

Essentially, I'm to angry, upset, and just flat out beaten up to go through the latest development.

Just some key things to those who care (or don't):

* Apparently the information that I violated my pain contract was false information. I was discharged from the clinic and anyone stating otherwise had false information and/or was making assumptions without fully reading my chart.
* I have exhausted my resources &amp; my will to keep fighting for all of this is just burned up.
* I want to die, but not before my parents
* I may be going on a doctor strike. #NoMOREDoctors
* I miss my brother.
* I hate my brother.
* As my disease progresses it looks like my ability to comfortably eat/enjoy food will - well - it wont happen. My best shot at survival is being food free with my feeding tube. Makes me wonder if being alive is worth it.

Anyway, I'm here defeated. Not here to argue about what a jackass X doctor is or what injustice has been done this time. Just simply defeated. I'm not here to get heated about the details of my story. 'nor am I here to do much more than just close this chapter so ya.

BODY: Hey Thanks,

A lot of the information these doctors know about me from each experience to the next, from my dead brother, to his deathly overdose to the kind of pain I experience is because I'm the dumbfuck who informed them and encouraged them to talk with each other. Don't know. I naively thought that dealing with a huge pain issue that I could be honest and upfront about it in order to recieve the care I needed. 

/r/chronicpain has banned me from participating in their disucssions due to my participation here on /r/opiates ... 

In other news I have a few other ideas I'd like to try before I go ahead and flat start getting expensive shit off the streets. I honestly know I can't do that because the #1 worse thing than being free, in my condition and in pain is being **in jail** for *any length* of time, in pain and condition. Not saying I would get arrested but if I did, I would not be able to handle it &amp; knowing that means I have no business playing in that playground.

&gt;Due to your recent post in /r/chronicpain, and your posting history in /r/opiates, we can't condone doctor shopping and misuse of narcotics and we don't want to subject the community to it.
I hope you find all the help you need.

I was simply in between doctors at the moment and very panicked that I had caused trouble by simultaneously following two referrals for pain doctors. One referral imminently did not work out while the other has managed other medication for me but refuses to work with me on a multilevel approach. I posted about it in /r/chronicpain and I guess they didn't like that.

&gt;Unfortunately due to the nature of those medications sometimes honesty is not the best policy, especially because familial addiction is viewed as an increased risk. I've found this link is tenuous at best but many doctors staunchly believe that because you might happen to share some DNA traits addiction is one of them.

Seriously. Lessons learned.

&gt;I just think you need to start completely fresh somewhere. I know it's awful and annoying, but it took me 4 different primary care physicians before I found one to be sympathetic even though I had colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis.

I can sympathsize, I'm moving out of state hopefully soon and I just hope to get new referrals and be done with all this bullshit. Hopefully I can learn and don't have to live the rest of my life like this otherwise I'm just gonna take that doctor up on his offer to remove my entire pancreas....

TITLE: So, We Think You're Suicidal... &amp; Pain Medication is Bad for that mmmKay?, POST BODY: Hey /r/Opiates,

So before you eat me alive for my post title - lemme explain - *hold 'yer rotten tomatoes!* I gotta have some fun with this horrid situation haven't I? 

I met with my blood doctor on Friday, who seems to be the only doctor on my team that actually gives a damn and sees reason. Unfortunately, he is not in a position to prescribe me any kind of pain medication. So, instead he's been working on finding out why these doctors do not wish to take on my case and/or why they will not prescribe me pain medication.

***They think I might be suicidal and may kill myself with said pain medication script...***

This pisses me off for a number of reasons:

1) It's insulting

Great. Now, that's out of the way. Of course, it's insulting, now what? Well, it is also valid. As well as disappointing that no one has felt comfortable enough to address this with me directly. Instead it has been thought that I be better left in the dark about it, left wondering and confused. That in and of itself is infurriating. 

But, back to valid. Yes, I have a history of sucicidality. Once when I was 16 (10 years ago) and another time just after my brother died (4years ago) when you look at my history of actual suicidality and what took place, I always reached out for help and there was never an attempt on my own life accidental or otherwise. So, yes it is valid, yes I have a history of depression &amp; mental illness, yes it is well managed, yes I am under the care of a therapy team &amp; a psychiatrist, no have none of my pain management specialist ever wished to reach out to said people. Which, is just *irresponsible* in my opinion if they are going to deny a legit pain patient pain medication for that reason without consulting their psych team...

Well then my blood doctor made a very valid point to me, **"these specialists are just as responsible for overtreating you as they are for undertreating you - if you buy off the street and die, they are still at fault insurance wise. They think they're covering their asses however, they are not."**

Which, is great and all. But eghhhgwwads it so does not help me right now. 

My pain doctor then made a second referral to an outside pain management specialist who I now have an appointment with for later on in the month. Hoping to hell he takes me on and works with me. Otherwise, I'm pretty much at the end of my rope suffering wise. 

It doesn't help that my brother died of a Heroin Overdose either. I feel as if that is haunting me a lot lately too.

Anyway, not doing too well. I'll see myself out now &amp; for those of you who are sick of my updates you can see yourself out too no-one is forcing you to read them and for those of you who have shown your continued support I am forever grateful. I do not know what I would do without you all. You guys rock &lt;3., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/34zt3n/so_we_think_youre_suicidal_pain_medication_is_bad/

TITLE: Success!, POST BODY: Hey /r/Opiates!!!

To those who have been following my melodrama of a medical case - I think it has a sweet ending/beginning now. I saw a new pain doctor to whom I spoke very candidly to. Told him about the bullshit, the shit I've been through and that I've just been dragging myself along best I can. 

This pain doctor is **NO BS** ... he took one list of my long list of medications and was just like, *wtf, why are you on 4 different non-narcotic pain medication that aren't doing shit?!* and I was kinda like, "that's been my arguement but no one seems to want to touch it/listen to me about it and my previous pain doctor was dead set against scripting narcotics because of my brother's death." 

For context purposes my brother died 5years ago of a Heroin Overdose and my previous pain doctor felt that addiction was something that was inevitable for me if he were to prescribe me a pain med so instead he had me on 3-5 non-narcotic pain medications to "manage" the situation. I finally got frustrated with him when he started pushing AA Meetings on me when I had never had an issue with drug abuse or encounter with opiates outside of a doctor perscribed setting and dropped him as a doctor. 

So, this new doctor who was referred to me by my blood doctor who is a prominent cancer specialist (I don't have cancer - just iron issues) really listened to me and felt that it was appropriate to remove the Lryica, Topamax, Tramadol, &amp; potentially the Linzess and replace it with a low dose of Baclofen and an Oxycodone 5mg PRN Script.

In fact he was ready to put me on Oxy's daily &amp; we discussed how that should be a thing eventually, but for the time being if we can put that off for as long as possible - then that is going to be the best bet. So I got a small script, nothing huge, but it's a big deal to me a bottle of 30 5mg IR Oxycodone tablets to last me 6weeks. The instruction reads to take "1-2 as needed for pain" 

This is a dream for me. It will keep me out of that damned ER and will help me deal with the pain on a manageable level. I can handle a 3-5 sometimes even a 6 on the pain scale. It's when it jumps to a 7-9 that I am really suffering and this script is going to tackle those days when my pain is at 7+. I'm literally so relieved I could cry. In fact, I think I'm going to go ahead and cry. It's been a long ass journey and hopefully they're finally willing to manage my situation. Maybe my team is finally falling into place.

There is hope.

xxx,

Dori

PS: For those who do not know, I have a feeding tube, I have a rare disorder that causes chronic pancreatitis. The feeding tube helps with this, but I still have pain from the original disorder + having a tube surgically implanted into my body. I've been strictly tube fed for two years and have not consumed food orally in that time period with the exception of just a few rare breakdown moments that made me very sick...., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/36j023/success/

So I haven't taken anything for a good 3-4 days and then yesterday with the pain I was like, "here lemme cut up a 5mg to make 2.5mgs and see if that helps!" worked like charm. Took 2.5mg around 4pm and then around 9pm I took another 2.5mg and was good to go. 

Anyway, 3pm today rolls around and I noticed my nose getting very  runny - but I wasn't having any pain. So, I sat and then I squirmed and then about 2hrs later at 5pm I decided to take another 2.5mg half to just hopefully get myself through whatever uncomfiness I was feeling.

Now I'm swimming in a sea of warmth and my nose is no longer running.

Holy fuck balls... was I in withdrawals!?!? From a 5mg oxycodone?!?!? WTF is *wrong* with me and my better question is HOW THE HELL AM I HIGH OFF 2.5mg right now. 

Which leads me to believe that all this crap about nose running and withdrawals has got to be in my head.

Except, my nose was most definitely sniffly and wet and cold an hour ago and that is not the case after taking this dose of medication.

TITLE: Transfering Narcotic Perscriptions from Pharmacy to Pharmacy, POST BODY: I'm just wondering in this atypical hypothetic if this would work/be okay:

I'm thinking of getting in touch with my pain doctor to see if he'll write me a bit of an extended perscription because, I am fearful that I am going to be out of my perscription before my next appointment.

Thing is I am out of state from my hometown and won't be back in my state until just a few days before my next appointment.

So I do not want to bother my doctor if this can't happen - hence why I'm asking here....

Can my doctor write a pen &amp; paper prescription for Oxycodone to be picked up by my family and then my family member can drop the prescription off at a big chain pharmacy (like CVS/Walgreens/Etc...) from there I could maybe called the pharmacy in my current area/state and they can pull &amp; fill that script here for me?

Or is that just completely impossible.

I know I recently had 5 prescriptions filled here using that method but none of those were narcotics.

TITLE: So, I'm ***NOT*** Crazy!, POST BODY: Hey! As many of you know I'm not in my regular city/state. Instead, I'm visiting elsewhere,  well while in elsewhere I've been panicking and having some issues with potentially running out of my narcotic script.

I even posted a little bit ago about how I might go about getting an emergency supply and decided against contacting my doctor about that for fear he may find things highly suspicious or think that I ran out of my script too early and just needed an early refill or whatever. 

Anyway, I ended up with some bad vomiting last night and was forced to go to the ER where I am visiting. I started the visit off by just getting the necessary medications - zofran, fluids, torodol just until labs and XRays came back etc., etc., to see if I'd be justified to accept narcotics.

Anyway, my XRay came back showing severe Gastroenteritis. The doctor at the ER administered a total of 2mg of IV Dialudid and wrote for a script of 20 5/325oxycodones for the increased pain I'm expected to have over the next 2-3weeks. 

So, today I called my regular pain doctor before filling the script and led with, *"I wont fill this if you don't want me to..."* My pain doctor thanked me for calling him and said it would be fine to fill the script and that I did the right thing by going to the ER. 

I thanked him for being reasonable and just explained that I didn't want to go against his orders. He seemed really receptive of that and was just great overall.

Not that he would've been bad had he said no to my request - I just would have dealt with it and suffered through, but finally having a doctor on my side who is willing to treat me like a respectable human is excellent.

Like so much relief right &amp; now I can enjoy my trip without stressing!

TITLE: Down and Out Monday ..., POST BODY: So, I saw a psychiatrist that I was hoping would have some brains to do a consult with in regards on how to handle my medical &amp; physiatric issues. I don't deny that I have a physiatrist history or anything of the sort.

I just feel that this psychiatrist who originally promised to look at my medical records as well as my psych history only took into account my psych records and not my medical history.

Upon asking him what he thought of the surgical reports he was just like, "I don't think anything was wrong and that operation should have been performed." He went on to say that my surgeon, "was overreaching in his diagnosis in order to make himself look better and unlike he did an unnecessary surgery." Which, is a load of bullshit and an audacious claim. Especially from someone who did not read that operative report or look at those documents at all.

It just felt like he was chraging us a ton of money to blow smoke up my ass. 

He claims that if I take different medications for my depression my pain and physical wellbeing will get better. I disagree strongly. There is no medication that makes this better. I require a multipronged approach from all aspects and closing the door on viable treatment options be it pain management, GI medications or whatever and replacing it with antipsychotics and therapy is a bad idea.

This isn't all or nothing. I want to take a multipronged approach to this use pain medication, therapy, antidepressants etc. together to achieve a wellbeing.

What people fail to see is I'm finally somewhat happy. I'm doing *well* I'm not broken at the moment to a point where it is making me unhappy. There is no denying I am broken since I can't eat but making false promises that if I do certain things without narcotics I can eat again just seems shortsighted. 

I don't want to gamble on a fix that could make me worse. 

The current regime is working. Why fuck with it? I did this under the pressure of my family and a psych team that I am just about ready to fire. 

I think starting today I'm making my own medical decisions and building my team appropriately. 

I know some of you are going to come in here and challenge me about all of this. I am very stressed right now and will be explicit with what I need right now:

(1) Support &amp; Understanding - not to be confused with pity party or sympathy

(2) Practical advice or what you would do if you were faced with my situation.

(3) Please do not patronize me, I just don't need it right now

(4) No tough love - I'm not in the mood to hear "harsh realiities"

(5) Take a caring approach with kindness

(6) I don't want you to bullshit me but please don't be harsh. I don't need that either.

(7) If you only have mean things to say or "I told you so" keep your trap shut. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3bjrmd/down_and_out_monday/

TITLE: Renewed Script &amp; Not Going to Rehab., POST BODY: So, I have been under an incredibly stressful few days. Basically to sum it up my therapy team started making a lot of outlandish claims:

*"You're eating food daily when you're not supposed to be!"*

*"You're not following your pain pill script! You're abusing the medications!"*

*"You're lead surgeon lied to make himself look good, you don't really have a GI Disorder!"*

Just to name a few of the weird things I've heard in this parallel universe over the last two days. My parents were brought in on all of this and it was the last claim that I don't "really have a GI disorder" that damaged the credibility of the Psychiatrist making that statement. 

I handed the psychiatrist my medical records that state there was a test done and it was positive. Something I could not fake even if I wanted to. He didn't seem to give a damn and I was pissed. 

Anyway, we sat down as a family today and decided to ***not*** put me in Rehab, especially since my pain doctor is okay with me being on the medications I am on. My Pain Doctor today was really happy that I was off the Lyrica, Tramadol and Topamax. He also validated my illness stating he had reviewed the operative reports and knows what a difficult thing what I have can be.

I expressed that I'm sure there's some level of psychosis alongside all fo the medical stuff ad at some point pain and whatnot can be amplified but so long as I remain in therapy with my trusted psychiatrist (not the 2nd opinion or the therapy team) he feels I will be good!

Such a fucking relief. I can't even. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3btmcg/renewed_script_not_going_to_rehab/

I will not be responding to any messages here.

I'm sorry, but the hate around here isn't worth being a member of the community.

So /u/annoyingopiates and others you have achieved your goal... I'll leave you all alone.

To those who have been kickass and awesome, thank you so much for a great ride. I have made some valuable friendships. If you need to get ahold of me feel free to PM me. Most of you (&amp; You know who you are) can get ahold of me in other ways.

This isn't anything against /r/opiates - just those who make this place so bitter that it isn't worth it. I am of the opinion that if the internet is upsetting you - it's time to take a fucking break from it and this subreddit has been the source of a great deal of negative feelings. I no longer come on excited to share or help out and offer what I know. 

Instead, I worry about being *judged,* *yelled at,* *downvoted,* and *ridiculed.*

See you all in another life., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3clrg0/see_ya_later_fuckers_the_ride_was_great/

TITLE: I Don't Know Her Username, But She Participated In This Subreddit..., POST BODY: I really spent some time debating if it was worth it for me to post here or not. I originally had a plan to post on October 24th and November 29th to commemorate the life and death of my brother due to Heroin. 

However, I'm back a bit sooner with some very sad news. My older cousin in her late 20s was found almost a week ago on Thursday. It is unknown what her cause of death is at this point in time is. However, there is a very strong chance that it was a Heroin Overdose. Back in May, I reconnected with her after not being in contact for over a decade. 

In fact the last memory of her I have aside from the recent past was when I was about 11 or 12. 

She grew into a beautiful adult. Despite her struggles she was supposedly clean. She constantly would reassure her mother that she would never die of an overdose. That people who die, die because they start out at their old dosage and that causes them to die. She knew better and if a relapse occurred she would take it slow and deal with it. She also swore to her mother that there was no way she'd ever go back to Heroin.

You see 3years after my brother died, so did hers, due to a diabetes complication (unrelated to drugs). 

We reconnected back in May. No longer children, but adults who have seen more than most do in a lifetime. It felt good to have her around. We seemed more like sisters and for me, the idea of being left alone without my brother seemed to evaporate because she would be there for me and I would be there for her. We got really close really quick. 

We would talk almost daily by phone or text message. We had long talks about everything as we got super close in the recent past. 

I was just scrolling through my messages with her. We were discussing AA Meetings because she wanted me to go with her. I turned her down because, I felt  it would be too triggering for me and that I would feel like a misfit with my pain condition that requires medication. 

During this conversation, I took the plunge and mentioned this SubReddit. She confirmed she had an account and would participate here in the past, but hadn't been here recently. 

I will update if I find her username... soon as I get into town for the services I will see if her aunt will allow me to see her laptop. If you have a female facebook friend who has passed away recently and their name begins with an "L" please feel free to PM me. I would be very grateful to know about it. Seeing as there is a likelihood it was her. 

I'm sorry I don't have her username. I just know she was a member of the community and is now gone. I can't even comprehend it.

There's a chance this wasn't a drug overdose, that it was a freak thing. Only time will tell, but it probably was an overdose.

For all the users and members of the community that have suffered a loss or death due to drugs, may you find peace.

EDIT: This is a blanket comment for anyone who feels they need to harass me. I honestly thought about posting this under a throwaway, for fear of being ridiculed yet again. Apparently, I'm super controversial here.

Just to keep things transparent, yes there's been some drama. Yes, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3clrg0/see_ya_later_fuckers_the_ride_was_great/) almost 3 months ago. 

Yes, I decided to post today in light of recent events. Mainly to see if anyone could possibly pair me up with her username and a reminder that NO ONE is immune from a drug overdose. All it takes is just a little bit too much or a bad cut to end up dead.

I made this post to inform, the community of a loss of life. Regardless of everything I felt it was important to share. Especially, since my cousin was a member of the SubReddit.

Now, with that said, you'll probably hear from me on October 24th and November 29th in remembrance of my brother. I feel strongly that if just one person here gets something out of the mistakes made by those around me, then the hate is absolutely worth it.

If you don't like it, use RES to put me on ignore and/or just downvote and move on. That is all., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3mzb7s/i_dont_know_her_username_but_she_participated_in/

TITLE: An Anecdote from the Day My Brother Died..., POST BODY: The day seemed to go smoothly. I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher’s assistant, “Why are you leaving early?”  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. I responded with, “I’ve got a class to drop and family business to take care of. I’ve attended every lecture and I need to go.” He couldn’t keep me there and I left.

He seemed puzzled by my commitment to family, that family was more important to me than school. I remember him protesting to me, lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.

At that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student in that moment.

It was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn’t feel like sitting through the professor’s last lecture. The class had been a complete bore the entire term. All he did was discuss his missed dreams of Hollywood and tell melodramatic stories about what could have been. I wasn’t about to miss out on life happening right now to listen to him moan about how it did not happen for him.

After leaving the classroom and getting home, I received a call from my father. He wanted to talk. I had no idea what was going on. 

When they arrived, I saw my mother’s face, a picture of distress and anguish, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, “He's dead.” I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.

Somehow we made it to my couch.  I don’t think, sitting on that couch that afternoon on November 30th, 2010, anything had ever been as dreadful and heartbreaking to me as that single moment in time. From there, time passed over like a glossy, unreal film. A young, seemingly healthy 20-year-old boy was dead, and it wasn’t any 20-year-old boy—it was my parent’s son and my brother. 

I packed up my bags, knowing I’d be staying in the family home for a little bit now. I felt as though I were on autopilot as tears faded and shock immediately set in.
You see he died from a Heroin overdose. He was cold upon discovery. He died alone in his room. I'll never get to see his kids or meet his girlfriend. I will never be able to lean on him and I will never be able to let him lean on me. I never got to celebrate his 21st birthday with him and I’ll never get to tease him about turning 30. All I have is 20 precious years that were far more valuable than I could have thought.

Guys, be careful out there, if you have not done so already I urge you to get a kit from /u/traceyh415. Her program is life saving and I only wish my brother had his own kit. I miss him terribly. I wish he was here everyday. I’ll tell you when you lose someone close, it doesn’t matter how much time has gone by. 5years later it is still as painful as the day it happened. The only real difference is that I have better ways of coping and dealing with the pain. Otherwise, I’d be a puddle of mush day in and day out. Be careful and be safe out there. 

*NOTE: I know a lot of people here have a bit of hate here towards myself. I am posting this because today would be my brother's 25th birthday. He died when he was 20 years old from a Heroin overdose if just one person here thinks twice or* ***gets a kit from /u/traceyh415 - I know I'll have done my part.*** *Drama or not, its worth it to me to post and leave this reminder.*

TITLE: One Month After He Turned 20, POST BODY: As you all may (or may not) remember, I celebrated my brother’s 25th birthday roughly a month ago &amp; I told the story of his death despite it being his birthday.

Every year on his birthday my family makes a donation somewhere that would’ve meant something to him. In the past it has been to places like animal shelters.  This year I called my parents up and got $50 from each of them. I also got $50 of my own money scraped together (goodness knows how) and we made our donation. It went to supply this subreddit with $150 to help supply a months worth of [Tracey’s Narcan Packages](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3lzt4f/care_packages_update/), which have proven time and time again to save the lives of people who struggle with addiction. It’s impressive that she’s saved over 140 lives and my family and I are proud to have been able to have a piece of that.

I spent time debating for the past month whether or not to make this public knowledge here. I finally (obviously) came to the conclusion that making this public knowledge was important. Not only to raise awareness for [Tracey](https://www.instagram.com/p/97e91zmT6q/) and [all the good](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3qx2vb/140_saves/) [she does](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3tfqb2/question/), but to celebrate life.

To celebrate my brother’s life, I mean what good is it if his impact isn’t heard and seen? I started posting here about a year ago on my brother’s birthday and the day he died. This is the 2nd year I’ve done it and I intend to post on those two days of the year on his behalf in the future and years to come.

TITLE: She Would Have Been 30 Today. Instead, She is Gone., POST BODY: Hello /r/opiates, 

Not sure how many of you remember me or even know of my existence. The [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3uowe1/one_month_after_he_turned_20/) I posted here was 4 months ago and after this I will see you all in September.

Today, I post because my beautiful Cousin would be 30 today. It’s her birthday. I wrote out an exceptionally long message about her and her story and was halfway through when it just made me cry. 

She left her mother alone on earth and while her mother is loved by many, she’s already lost her son to a diabetes complication 2-3/years ago and now her daughter is gone as of September. 

The wounds from this are still fresh. I’ve become a surrogate daughter of sorts to my cousin’s mother. I’ve seen a lot of death from this addiction. I encourage each and every one of you to take steps towards harm reduction and stay strong. I do not think it can be stressed enough the importance of this.

Here are my committed posting dates... in case anyone cares....!

* September 24th - The Day My Cousin Died
* October 24th - My Brother's Birthday
* November 29th - The Day My Brother Died
* March 31st - My Cousin's Birthday

*on the lighter side:* For those who are curious about my personal life, and what’s been happening with me medically seeing as I’ve had to deal with a harrowing disability … things are finally looking better. 

I’ve moved away from the feeding tube and into eating actual food. It is not easy. I need to time meals with pain medication correctly and it’s a very fine balance because one misstep means a miserable amount of pain.

Some days will be worse than others, but it’s finally manageable. As my health has improved I have been able to reach out to my extensive network. At this very moment I’m being considered for an executive position with a massive company that is world famous. 

Now, if only someone could shut the crow that has been stalking my porch up – I’d be exceptionally happy. Being woken up at 5am by this bird is starting to drive me bananas.

BODY: Unfortunately, I know all too well what all that means. I have G/J. J port has historically been used for medication administration and nutrition whereas my G port is designed so that I can vent/empty stomach content. 

Right now, we've reached a point where when the tubing malfunctions next. I get to make a decision as to whether or not to keep it. I went for 3 years being strictly tube fed through the J-port. 0/10 would never do again by choice. 

As for my cousin, I just miss her and sometimes feel like I'm picking up scattered pieces of her life and am trying to glue them back together haphazardly. I do what I can. Her mother is my primary concern. No one should ever have to endure losing both adult children in a 2-3 year span. I don't care if you're the zodiac killer - no one needs that or should have to experience that amount of pain. Right now if I call my mom, her mom gets a call too. If I text my mother a funny picture, her mother gets it too. If I email out gifs, yep her mother gets it too.

It's not much but it's the best I can do and I think it goes a long way...

BODY: Surgery was a HUGE success. I actually think having the neck surgery was the root of a few of my symptoms that we thought were GI related but turned out to be spinal/neck related. The disc was pushing deep into my spinal column and now I have metal plates in my neck so, I'll always go ding at the airport for sure!

&gt;is a feeding tube literally just a tube stuck down your throat that they pump liquids into? or am i way off?

You're actually not that way off. When I started 3 years ago I had a tube that went up my nose, down my throat through my stomach to my small intestine that would attach to a pump. 

I had that for 3 months before they surgically installed a feeding tube directly into my abdomen. Basically to do that they puncture a hole through my abdominal wall right down to my stomach and string a tube through it. For my specific tube it was strung through my stomach to my small intestines. 

Everything had a point of access like a port that stuck out of my body. I would then connect a detachable pump to it and the pump would pour liquid food into my body. 

Does that make more sense?

BODY: I litterally asked the doctor, "when I hear spine surgery I hear about how it screws people up, not how it makes them better..." and my doctor simply said, "There are just as many if not more good results those who have spine surgery are more likely to voice if it goes wrong than those it goes right for. Those that it goes right for will move on with their life."

I honestly wouldn't have done the surgery but it was an emergency, I was going blind in my left eye and pain was shooting through the entire left side of my body not to mention I was struggling with a lot of muscle weakness. Left untreated a lot of unreasonable problems could arise. I found out around May 12th I had a 3 month limit to have surgery then on May 19th I ended up actually having surgery because I deteriorated very quickly.

He came from a good home and had more opportunities/life experiences than some 90-year-olds. My parents were just naive about the drugs after surgery at the time and no one we knew ever had a problem. Unfortunately, he got hooked and it killed him.

I came from the same set of parents and I turned out pretty damned well. I did exactly what you are doing got my AA degree &amp; transferred to a top 25 school for my Bachelors. I conquered school and now I work in social media marketing in an industry that makes billions. It's pretty impressive if you ask me but I'm biased.

TITLE: Literal Shit Post!, POST BODY: /r/Opiates Guide to Pooping
-----

I don't know why I felt the need to put so much time into this, but I did so enjoy it!

Whether you’re in withdrawals needing to take Lope or have a heavy habit and can’t go I figured this run down on things would help.

I have a terrible fucking gut due to my gastroparesis &amp; other gastrointestinal issues like pancreatitis. So, take my regime with a huge grain of salt. Unless you’re on insane amounts of narcotics you could probably get away with using 1-2 things from my personal list:

1. Cap of Miralax in my morning coffee
2. 25mg dose of Movantik with my morning meds
3. Tablets of Senna in the morning
4. 1-2 Servings of refried beans throughout the day
5. Glycerin Suppositories for moderate constipation
6. Enemas for emergency situations 

Natural Helpers:
-----

**Prunes/Prune Juice:*** Eating 3-5 Prunes are a day is an easy way to keep your gut moving. One cup of prune juice will work within 2-5hours. Be careful if you eat or drink too much of this, you will end up with problems.

**Coffee:** Coffee is known to stimulate the bowels however, it is not recommended to have more than 2 or 3 cups because it is a diuretic and can cause dehydration.

**Fiber:** Fiber comes in a ton of shapes and forms and will get your gut going.

* Fruits are really great with raspberries providing 8 grams of fiber in a single serving
* Whole Wheats are also good, think bran, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and so forth
* Nuts and Beans are really good especially black beans, almonds, and lentils
* Vegetables like broccoli and artichoke are great. Think dark leafy greens here. Iceberg lettuce is worthless.

Over the Counter Drugs:
----

**Miralax:** Miralax is great because it is gentle. You can take a maximum of two capfuls in a day. It is best when dissolved in something warm like your tea or coffee. It works by drawing water into your intestinal tract and in turn, this stimulates a bowel movement.

**Senna**: It is a natural laxative that will work overnight or within 24hrs. It is gentle and has been known to be used for irritable bowel syndrome.

**Colace** is a stool softer and does the same sort of thing Miralax does. Some people find Colace helps more than Miralax others do not. Everyone is different.


**Ducalax:**This stimulates your intestines to work faster and ultimately produces a bowel movement in 4-6 hours at the most. It's a great quick way to relieve any kind of sever constipation. However, if you have IBS this might make you cramp and have problems. 

**Magnisum Citrate:** If you can stomach drinking it this will do the trick quick! It takes maybe 30 minutes and your gut is moving. Doctors sometimes ask patients to drink this after they finish the prep for a colonoscopy to ensure that everything is out.

**Enemas:** If you feel it there, but can't get that final push through, use an enema. It's no worse than plugging and really does work. Be careful though, you can become dependent on enemas. Only use them every so often as a last resort. Do not use more than 1 a day otherwise you will get dehydrated and that causes problems..


Prescription:
----------

**Linzess:** Primarily used for IBS-C it produces a good movement without too much effort. Problem is after about 2 weeks it starts to lose its effects and is no longer effective.

**Movantik:** It's naloxegel. Basically well, [read this](https://www.movantikhcp.com/about-movantik/mechanism-of-action.html) It explains it much better than I can.

TITLE: Life is way too hard sometimes., POST BODY: On April 12th I woke up with shooting pains in my left shoulder. A week later, I decided to get it looked at. On May 6th I went to the ER and they did an emergency MRI. Turns out I had a disc herniation in my neck. 

On the 12th of May, the Neurosurgeon advised surgery to fix the issue within the next three months. On May 16th the pain became so incredible I went back to the emergency room where they admitted me. I had surgery on May 19th and was hospitalized for a total of 10 days 2 of which were spent in the ICU.

My boyfriend at the time showed up to the hospital maybe twice during that time. That among other things led to a breakup with him, and that was difficult because we lived together.

Now I'm 27, completely disabled with a metal plate in my neck and just feeling cruddy overall, plus I've had to move home. I haven't lived at home since I was 19. It's driving me bonkers. I can barely shower on my own.

Not to mention my doctor is furious with me. I'm on 20mg of oxycodone in a day (which is like nothing) and he wants me down to 15mg. However, I went through my script way fast. Luckily he renewed it early, but if I do that again, I'll be SOL. 

I was talking to my therapist who is also an addictions counselor and she said the rate of heroin overdoses has QUADRUPLED because of the restrictions the DEA is putting on doctors. 

So people who would never normally need or want heroin are getting it and overdosing. She said even cancer patients are getting denied pain medication. It is a cruel and unusual world for sure.

The good news is the feeding tube got removed. THANK GOD. I feel better without it now. It did it's job and now I'm doing better in that department.

For the curious here is a few pictures that document my feeding tube removal and what they did to my neck:

In the meantime I had a thought that might help some of you guys here stay reminded of your reason to stay sober. Basically you take your #1 reason for being sober and make it a password on your computer.

For instance if it's to avoid jail time make your passwords something like, "Sober4N0J@il" (sober for no jail)


That way you're constantly reminded of your reason. I hope that helps and I'm not out of line here., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/4trx44/just_an_idea_to_help/

TITLE: So you don't want my money next time? Really?, POST BODY: Today I was in contact with two connects one was a $50 each way uber ride away from me and the other was $70 uber ride away each way.

Ride one had a better price and was cheaper to get to via uber so I decided to use ride one. I let ride two know off the bat to not hold any shit for me if someone else comes along and I'd let them know if I no longer need them.

So after picking up from ride one successfully, I texted ride two and told them, 

&gt;"hey, no longer am in need but, please keep me in mind when you reup next, I get into bad shape occasionally and its always nice to have options!" 

They responded telling me I what a waste of time I was. I was just like, Sorry? I told ya up front not to hold anything for me!

And to make this person even shadier, they had tried to get me to WU them money and said they'd mail me my shit since it was so expensive to get out to them. Obvs. I refused to do that...

But, like WTF? Did I break some kind of code or is this connect just batshit or not legit?

I saved them in my phone as "batshit don't do business" in case I ever run into their number again...I just don't understand why they'd be so pissed when I said not to hold in the first place?

TITLE: I'm 27 In Physical Pain and I'm 100% Addicted. My Dad Just Found my Stash of Extra Oxy's - I'm Lost., POST BODY: Fuck me, fuck my life, just fuck.

So, I've been living at home following my break up with my boyfriend and my Dad found my stash of extra Oxycodone. Obviously, he freaked out, and he said he waited a day to confront me about it. He would like me to go through insurance covered rehab but, knows if I don't want it, it will never work. I agree with him. It won't work now, not while I have so much pain going on that is ill-managed. 

I'm not terrified of withdrawals, I'm terrified of PAIN. Not to mention, I don't have any desire to be clean, I just want to be *managed*.

He made an offer to basically enable me. Move me out of their house, to an apartment, where I'll be able to do what I "want." I put want in quotations because I don't know what I want. All I want is to be out of pain. That's it.

What the hell do I do? I feel icky.

My dad said I didn't have to make any decisions today, that I could wait and see in January, and just see. Amazingly enough, he gave me one of my "meds" to pull me out of withdrawals and if I need more, I just need to talk to him for every dose. 

I'm sick in so many ways and I'm so just blah.

Edit: I've tried methadone. Worst withdrawals of my fucking life and I had a seizure on Suboxone so those two medications aren't really a viable option. I'm on 50mgs of Oxycodone in 24hrs to stay 100% pain-free &amp; not high. I am prescribed 20mgs/day by a pain clinic. My doctor refuses to make any increases citing my age &amp; the potential for addiction, which I already have along with dependency.

Edit Again: I also had a feeding tube for 3 years for my pancreatic condition and had spinal surgery this past May.

TITLE: So this happened today! [Updates] on getting busted by my dad., POST BODY: So, since being caught red-handed with extra medication that wasn't a part of my script things at home have been decent enough. Despite being 27 my parents have asked me to stay home for the next few days and get some of my things in order.

Yesterday, that consisted of speaking for quite some time with my dad about what was happening to me with the pain and the subsequent addiction. We also spoke about my father's past and he opened up with things that I cannot share on a public forum, but I came to the realization that my dad knows a lot more about addiction problems than I thought.

He also knows I'm going to be a challenge to treat due to the fact that he knows not only am I brilliant (his words) but, I'm a clone copy of him in many ways (we have similar thinking patterns, behaviors, and nuances that match up) and that I am addicted to my medication as well as dependent on them for legitimate pain that he's witnessed over the last few years.

So, according to him rehab is:

1. Probably Not Going to be Effective
2. Not Worth its Price Tag

So, yesterday was my last day of being miserable.

Today, I told my dad I was going to get my space organized, help mom do some laundry and kitchen things and just chill out. Well, he gets home and sees everything was followed up on and I didn't blow him off on the things he wanted me to do.

So, now I have a bouquet of multi-colored roses sitting on the table by the window. He told me they were for getting shit done and that he knows what I've been through and recognizes it isn't easy. He got them both as a reward and "get better" gesture. 

Honestly, it feels awkward to me, didn't he just catch me with drugs? What is this sorcery? Huh? But, something about it feels right, like he knows, more than I could ever know. 

&amp; that alone means the world.

**TL;DR: Got caught with extra meds, rewarded with flowers 3 days later after a few deep discussions and following up on things that needed to be done around the house.**

EDIT

My parents used to protect me from her. The last time we talked I was 13 and she was 16. We had thanksgiving dinner together. Then, 2 years ago we reconnected after being estranged for over a decade. 

My parents limited my communication with her through my teenage and young adulthood years because they wanted to protect me from her Heroin addiction. 

When we reconnected as women in our mid-late 20s it was like I found my sibling again. My brother had died 4 years prior and her brother who I never knew had died 2 years prior to us reconnecting. Mine had died from a heroin addiction and her brother died of a diabetes complication.

I knew she was headed down the path of relapse and I HATE myself for not speaking up about it. But, then again on September 24th, 2015 when she died we had only been talking again for 8 months. It wasn’t my place to intervene and apparently others close to her had confronted her about it days before she died.

I feel for her mother who now has lost both her adult children. No parent should ever feel that pain.

I miss my cousin so much. Do me a favor guys, and practice harm reduction. In her memory., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/548yso/i_never_found_her_username_shes_been_gone_a_year/

I've been in a significant amount of pain throughout this hospital stay for the last 8 days. Plus, I've been itchy regardless of the narcan drip.

Finally, today, after they did the colonoscopy and found I have ulcers throughout my colon (yay /s) did I wake up in pain and the surgery unit gave me IV push pain meds that didn't do jack shit. 

I made the decision then and there to refuse the Narcan drip. I got after the pain team for having me on that and no wonder I was in so much pain, etc. they now have me off the Narcan drip and on the Benadryl.

It's so fucked up because when I first came in they insinuated I like the way Benadryl feels and that Benadryl is addicting in and of itself and I told them about the itching and that is how this whole mess started. 

How fucked are things if doctors are now hesitant to give BENADRYL with an IV Piggyback of 0.5mgs of Dilaudid!?!!?!? What sense does that make! NONE! 

Luckily today the pain has been better and everything is okay, I should go home tomorrow but holy fuck did these guys screw me for this stay. I should've refused from day 1 but I was trying my best to be cooperative and practice trusting the professionals.

TITLE: Thank Junkie Jesus!, POST BODY: Ahhhh good things all around. First of all, I got my first paycheck for my new job this past Friday which was super exciting. 

Unfortunately, going into work has been difficult this first week. I'm very fatigued but worst of all I'm short on my oxycodone. I'm prescribed and usually take 20mgs in a day but, have had to cut down to 15mgs to get to my next pain doctor appointment because  I had a lot of breakthrough pain this month and required extras. 

Anyway, at 15mgs (5mg 3x/daily) I've been going into withdrawals on a nightly basis. Around 2 or 3am I've woken up consistently in a cold sweat, with my nose running and all the bells and whistles of withdrawal and pain. 

For the past week I've been taking my last 5mgs at 6pm going to bed at 10pm waking at 2am in withdrawals, getting back to bed at 5am and then waking at 9am to take my medication to be out of withdrawals.

I don't think it's mental because I'm waking in a cold sweat vs. being awake and talking myself into it. Anyway, this is a good story so, today I was at my cousin's place and we were talking when suddenly she asks me about my pain and what I go through. I explained my nightly predicament at the moment too.

Well, she broke her arm last month and she was prescribed "too many" painkillers. So, she asked if I needed any extras. I got ten 5/325 Percocet from her and now I can say goodbye to restless sleep. I'm so fucking happy right now. 

Thank Goodnes Grief God! :-) Nothing like not withdrawing., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/56qjg7/thank_junkie_jesus/

TITLE: 2nd Paycheck Tomorrow!, POST BODY: Hot damn man! I am so excited about getting P-A-I-D tomorrow! It's my 2nd check from this new job and it comes in tomorrow. Right now my boss is being chill and paying me weekly, because I've been super short on cash and he knows it. I'm happy because I'll be able to get rid of my death note (Samsung Galaxy Note 7) and pay I few people I owe cash to (regular loans not drug fronts). Plus, I might even have enough for a few extra meds, we'll see though. 

If not I plan to stash $75-$100 of my money to be able to get a big haul next week or in 2 weeks from now depending on what my doctor scripts me Monday. Which is another thing I'm nervous about for a few reasons. 

My pain doctor used to script me 5mg IR Opana's so I'm going to see if he doesn't mind adding those back into my regime. I had a 10-day hospital stay this month that could've been avoided had I had decent breakthrough pain medication. Although who knows, I did have GI Bleeding too, but after the GI scope my specialist said it was nothing to worry about at all and will heal up on its own! So that is good!

I'm in such a predicament because pain medication actually makes my condition worse in the long run, but leaving my condition alone, I'm non-functional. It just means I can't miss a single dose of medication being an hour late on meds can throw my whole system for a loop. I feel like I'm constantly chasing the pain and wish there was a better option, but such is life.

Shitpost because I can!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/57dm2f/2nd_paycheck_tomorrow/

TITLE: Good Guy Connect &amp; Junkie Jesus Makes the Stars Align!, POST BODY: Today, I met up with a connect and left my cell phone in his car! I just about flipped a lid because I use Uber and Lyft to get around and was 100% out of cash with the exception of $8 and over 15miles away from my home. It would be really hard to explain to my family how the fuck I ended up out there without my phone or money... 

So...

I tried calling my phone from a strangers phone but that didn't work. I usually have my phone on silent so I expect that's what's happening to me now.

By the grace of Junkie Jesus I had my laptop on me... So, I whip it out and there happens to be free wifi at my location. THANK JUNKIE JESUS. I text my connect from a web application I use for anything drug related and he comes back to give it back to me! I was so fucking relieved. 

It's my worst nightmare being stuck out in the middle of an unfamiliar area without my cell phone and no money whatsoever. I ended up giving my guy the rest of the cash on me which was just that $8 but, I felt it was only right to "tip" him for bringing it back. 

I need to get over my nerves when doing deals, I just get shaky, jumpy, nervous, and forgetful which leads to bad shit happening. Hopefully, this is a lesson learned and I can calm the fuck down in the future and NEVER leave my cell behind again., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/59f3op/good_guy_connect_junkie_jesus_makes_the_stars/

TITLE: Every year for the last few years I posted on his birthday..., POST BODY: Except, I forgot to post this past October 24th, 2016 when my brother would have been 26 this year. He died six years ago of a heroin overdose. Alone in his room. For the past 2 years, I've posted about his death on his birthday. ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3q2f7k/an_anecdote_from_the_day_my_brother_died/) &amp; [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2k5ri0/in_about_an_hour_and_a_half_we_always_counted_our/)) 

I feel ***awful*** not only because I forgot to post on his Birthday, but I forgot it was even his Birthday. I woke up that morning with shooting pains down my left arm, tingling and a lot of numbness in my fingers. It was a lot like my issues before my spinal neck surgery. 

So, for the entire day, I was in incredible pain and ended up going to the ER late that night. My mom came by the ER around 11pm to sit with me, something she rarely does, and it was then that she realized I forgot the birthday. 

While I feel awful about forgetting his birthday, I can't help but feel relieved too, like maybe I'm somehow moving on and not stuck in the past missing him. 

For the past 6 years there hadn't been a day I didn't think about my brother until recently when I started to think about him every few days instead of every day.

Anyway, I still wanted to post about him and share, because I think it serves a purpose. Losing him has been the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. Cherish every moment you have with your loved ones, even if they drive you nuts, there is a reason you love them.

TITLE: Well, Fuck Me There's Issues with My Spine... Still..., POST BODY: As many of you know I have an abundant amount of spine and stomach issues. Today, I'm talking about my spine. I went to see my Neurosurgeon and he said that my neck surgery was 2 levels. 1 level healed fine but the 2nd healed improperly and then that has caused some issue at the level below my surgery site.

The doctor said that this is primarily treated with pain medication and cervical epidurals. Surgery is an option but it's an absolute life or death last resort kinda thing. They do not want to do it if they can avoid it.

For me, this is both bittersweet. On one hand, my doctor is going to call my pain specialist and explain/request that I be on a higher dosage of pain medication. On the other hand, it's devastating to be in so much pain. I haven't even been getting high from my medication just barely out of pain.  I do feel relieved that all my pain medication needs and extra buys haven't been because I'm just fine, because I'm obviously not. 

For me, getting high is probably equivalent of any other persons normal. I can do things, I feel better, I have energy and I can function. 

As for the epidural option, I'll know more when I talk to my pain specialist but from what I understand neck epidurals can be dangerous and stuff. :(

Not to mention, I'm supposed to be traveling outside of the country and I'm super nervous about it seeing as I'm going to be away from all my doctors for a month and that might be hard. I'm going to request that my pain doctor give me extra medications for breakthrough pain on top of the increase for the just in case if things get bad I don't have to cut my trip short or something.

Plus, I'm not looking forward to the flight to Europe. I am still wanting/needing to go though. Blah. Sorry for the wall of text., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5cigit/well_fuck_me_theres_issues_with_my_spine_still/

TITLE: Increased Script., POST BODY: So, I knew I was getting some kind of increase on my prescription this month because as it turns out [my spine didn't heal properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5cigit/well_fuck_me_theres_issues_with_my_spine_still/) from my surgery and I have been in incredible amounts of pain because of it.

I was hoping they could do surgery and make it go away again but apparently due to how invasive surgery is, they can't just "redo" it and fix it. They've now given me the recommendation to treat it with pain medication, physical therapy and if it become unbearable as a last resort they can redo my original surgery to fix it. 

So, for the past 10 days I've been taking about 10-15mgs of oxycodone to make it last for me. My doctor and I had a long discussion and he agreed to increase my script by 30 pills. I'm both ecstatic (because, fuck ya no pain finally, what I need) and disappointed (because, oh hell no, do I need to live like this for LIFE!?!?!!??!!?) and it feels really weird.

TITLE: I Swear my Dad &amp; I are the same person., POST BODY: I love him dearly and have talked about him before. For the last two or three months he's been helping me manage my medication so I don't overuse my script. Bless him for even doing that. However, some days he forgets to leave my dose out or is late coming home. Much later than he expected and I'm needing my meds!

So for the last two months, it's been a game of hide and seek. He hides my meds and when he's not around I find them, take exactly what I need, put them back and tell him he left it out for me.

So far my medication has been hidden between the bath towels, in his inner jacket pocket in the closet, under a magazine, under mom's computer, and today I found it in 5 minutes flat figuring he wouldn't re-hide it in an old spot and sure enough, it was behind the curtains!!!

Every time I go on a hunt I tell myself, "I know him, well, now where the fuck would I hide it if I was him?"

I just find it funny enough and wanted to share. This is all going on unbeknownst to him. BWahahahaha.

TITLE: My Brother died tonight 6 years ago. He was discovered the morning of the 30th. I found out later that night., POST BODY: For the past 3 years, I've posted religiously here about it on both his birthday and the anniversary of his passing. Today/tonight is the 6th anniversary, he would have been 26 now. 

I wrote this short piece on it many years ago recounting the memory of the day he passed to get it out of my head.

I feel like it's time to share it. I hope this resonates with at least one of you. Be strong and stay safe out there.

&gt;November 30th, 2010, could have been any other day. It was the end of fall term. 

&gt;I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher’s assistant, “Why are you leaving early?”  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. I responded with, “I’ve got a class to drop and family business to take care of. I’ve attended every lecture and I need to go.” He couldn’t keep me there and I left. He seemed puzzled by my commitment to family, that family was more important to me than school. I remember him protesting to me, **lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.**

&gt;At that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student in that moment. It was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn’t feel like sitting through the professor’s last lecture.

&gt;As I got into my apartment hallway on my way home I noticed my phone had a voicemail. I remember listening to it in the elevator, on my way to the first floor. Short and sweet it struck fear into my heart:
 
&gt;“Hey Dori, it is Daddy. Call me—we need to talk.”

&gt; I called him back right away from the hallway on the house line. The phone rang once, and he answered. We talked, and he said that him and mom were coming right over, that there was something to discuss—we needed to have a family meeting right away, and they would be at my apartment. 

&gt;Right away it was strange; we had just had a huge meeting about finances that weekend. Why would we need to meet again? Now? What for? I flew into a mode of panic. The apartment was a mess. I had twenty girls over the night before and didn’t get a chance to really clean up that morning. Quickly I started cleaning the apartment like I never had before. I’m not one to keep things disorganized but I’m not one to clean either, especially for my parents. The behavior was anxiety induced and at first it worked as a great distraction: “Just get the apartment cleaned—think about things later.”  I don’t know why I felt this way. Perhaps it was something in my father's tone that gave him away or a sixth sense of sorts that I had. that afternoon. I acted out of pure fear and It took 20 minutes to get the kitchen, bedroom area, and living area fully organized and done. Even had time to get the laundry sorted and clean clothes on hangers. My parents should have been arriving at any minute.

&gt;Yet they weren’t there. Another five long minutes passed and I racked my brain, “This isn’t good,” I thought to myself, as I peeked out the front window to look for them pulling up. They weren’t there, and I paced.
“Well, think!” I remember telling myself harshly. I remember analyzing it. “Dad called me, not mom. He said Daddy. Something’s wrong, his tone was off. My great grandmother, she’s 93 perhaps something horrible has happened to her? But that’s on Mom’s side, why wouldn’t mom call me about that?” I wondered, “Well, wait, the dog’s been sick. We know we have to put him down soon. Maybe he needs to be put down. Maybe the vet called.”
        	
&gt;“My brother is going to freak out. I wonder if he’s coming with mom and dad. They should be in the car by now. It’s been thirty minutes, they should’ve been here by now. They don’t live that far away. Maybe I should call the house and see if my brother answers, they’re probably in the car alone without him and he’s at home and already knows.”

&gt;It was at that moment I was paralyzed with fear. I went to dial the house number but could not. I did not want to confirm the next thought I had. “What if my brother doesn’t answer? What if something’s happened to him?”
And then it struck me, ten minutes before my parents arrived. Ten minutes before I knew anything had happened, I feared the worst. “What if my brother got into trouble—what if he’s dead?” And like a mantra I repeated over and over again, out loud, “Please let it be the dog. Please let it be the dog. Don’t let it be him, not him.”

&gt;Ten minutes of this sorta prayer went on, and I saw my parents pull up through the upstairs window. Before I knew it they were at my door, and as I opened the door before they could even fully ring the bell because I was right on the other end, waiting, I saw my mother’s face, a picture of distress and anguish, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, “Your brother is dead.” I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.

Just in case anyone is wondering, he died of a heroin overdose. I miss him terribly even 6 years later, it's still hard., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5fk551/my_brother_died_tonight_6_years_ago_he_was/

TITLE: Just Using the WiFi on a Plane and am SOOOO Bored. Travel Stories Time...Because you Must be Bored too., POST BODY: I've been on a flight for about 7hrs and 15minutes I have another 3hrs and 30minutes to go! It's been a month-long nightmare of a trip. Travelling is supposed to be fun, but we have business and family internationally so it's more of an obligation than anything for me/my family. 

I was sick the entire time and for whatever reason couldn't get on the program with my jet lag. Oh well, hopefully, it works in my favor now that I'm headed home. 

I visited the ER 2 times during my 20-day stay once because my neck surgery was SO painful in the cold there, more so than normal, and my neurosurgeon sent me based on my symptoms. They prescribed Klonopin to help me sleep/deal with the anxiety I was facing and apparently it works as a muscle relaxer too.

Then, the 2nd time I was vomiting for 3 days before I went in again. Sure enough, I had a mild case of pancreatitis. They patched me up with a Demerol shot and an additional 30 pills 10mg pills of Oxycotin in order to cope with it till I got home.

Luckily I had a week and rested lots with fluids and things and my pancreatitis has (mostly) subsided. At least I'm not vomiting anymore. Pain has just been bad, between the spine surgery and pancreatic issues I've been in so much pain.

Traveling today has been an absolute disaster. First I couldn't sleep as per usual and had to be up at 5am to be out of the house at 6am to catch a bus that got delayed causing us to RACE through the airport. At one point we're in a line and people ushered us forward because our flight boarded in 10 minutes and we were nowhere near our gate. Finally, get through everything and barely make our gate.

Our first flight was 1.5hrs and not so bad and connecting was easy because we had 3hrs and priority lounge access. 

However, getting on the flight was a whole other story. Our seating arrangement map was different than the actual plane so instead of having an aisle seat like we wanted we have a window, 2nd window, and middle seat. IDK How that got messed up but it did. (3 of us traveling) and long story short my pain medicine was in my dad's bag which he stowed somewhere on the flight because he got swapped from a middle seat to a window. 

So now here we are taking off and I am in desperate need of my pain med. I pass out because of sheer exhaustion and pain and then when I wake up I kid you not it was a 45minute to hour ordeal to get the stewardess find his bag, get my medication and return his bag to him. 

But now I'm settled and in this rambling time I wasted 10 minutes so yay., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5hmf7m/just_using_the_wifi_on_a_plane_and_am_soooo_bored/

TITLE: I feel like I'm going to JINX things if I post this... but... I... Have... to... Share...!!!, POST BODY: I've been in the hospital for almost a week now. This is my 1st hospitalization this year, 2nd one in 6months and it was my 6th ER visit in 6 months. It's such a big problem my doctors started tossing out ideas, what about an abdominal pain pump? Ketamine? Epidural? What can we do?

Well, my pain specialist just put the order in for Fentanyl. 

I don't know the dosage just yet, but regardless I'm excited to try this and finally get some relief. I'm even more stoked that they're taking my pain seriously!

It is Fentabulous!

Edit: 25mcg is my dose! Yay!

Edit 2: Had the patch on for a half hour so far and am feeling really really really good. Just nice. It's currently 4pm.

Edit 3: Currently 5:20pm and my nurse just hung dilaudid to get me ahead of my pain. So fucking amazing., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5m2im3/i_feel_like_im_going_to_jinx_things_if_i_post/

TITLE: Holy Fucking Shit., POST BODY: Oh my fucking god. I'm on cloud 9, I cannot express how amazing I feel right now. Since my doctor tried me on the Fentanyl patches 3 days ago, my life has dramatically changed. 

**I showered.**

I want to brag about showering for a minute because it's something that I've struggled with. Not that I dislike water or have any bathing fears, just in the sense that showering properly was always an ordeal for me. By the time I finished blow drying my hair I'd be exhausted. I had to schedule showers on "off" days because I would become so exhausted I couldn't do much more except rest.

Today I showered, and it energized me. I felt *so* good, peppy, awake and just alive for the first time.

My body doesn't feel like it is in overdrive, I can sit in a chair without it hurting me, I feel empowered like I'm going to be able to accomplish all of my goals. Hell I feel like I can actually go back to school or get a job or something now. I finally have a future. Being on the right dose of pain medication is making all the difference.

TITLE: I'm snorting my pills, but I will NOT be seeking out Heroin 'nor will I be looking to smoke my patches., POST BODY: Hey guys after concern from many users including u/timbf, u/herniatedhermit and u/chasing-d0pamine I want to clarify. I've been super intrigued by Heroin, but I know if I go down that path there is no turning back. 

Despite the pain I feel and my desire to get high, it's just not worth it to me. I think of my brother like timbf said everyday and I think of my cousin who has lost both her adult children and I just cannot do that to my family/parents. Hell, I can't do that to you guys or *my dog*!

Now, I have been snorting my pills. I prefer that route of administration because it pulls me out of withdrawals in seconds to minutes. I usually will snort my morning dose, swallow my afternoon one and snort the one right before bed. 

However, I have NOT been smoking my fentanyl patches. I did try to and I'm clumsy/such a worry wort that I definitely did not do it properly and barely felt a thing. 

Instead, I have been placing heat on my skin patch to make it release a bit faster but that's the most I've really done. 

I do like to get high and feel good because for me that means I'm out of pain completely, but I understand there are going to be times when pain is apart of me and heroin is far too dangerous to even try once. 

**Curisosity killed the damned cat but, I'm not gonna let it kill me.**

TITLE: Addiction is a Disease vs. Choice and my Thoughts on it. Asking for your feedback., POST BODY: I recently posted[ this meme](http://imgur.com/a/BANo9). Mainly to poke fun at people who criticize drug users. I posted it for *fun* but it does bring to light a very serious conversation to be had.

I was surprised by the number of people who were saying calling addiction a disease is a bad thing, a crutch if you. But what if I told you calling it a disease and using it as a crutch can be a positive/good thing? What if I told you it could lead to recovery? 

I personally believe that addiction is a disease and that by denying that a person is only perpetuating myths and stigmas regarding addiction and dependence.

I have a few diagnosis/diseases:

* Gastroparesis
* Chronic Pancreatitis
* Addiction/Opioid Dependence
* Schizoaffective Disorder

I would be very comfortable telling people that I was battling those four diseases, but everyone looks at it differently.

I understand that it isn't a traditional disease,^[1](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02791072.1993.10472271) but would you say mental illness isn't a sickness of sorts too? What would you call it? A choice? If it was a choice addicts wouldn't exist because they would be able to quit anytime.^[2](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/278/5335/45) Addiction is a disease of disease of compulsion and drive. It involves the Orbitofrontal Cortex.^[3](http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/318.short)

I believe that playing the sick role^[4](http://davidscottsociology.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/illnessbehaviorandthesickrole.pdf) gets you nowhere and I think that is where people get upset with labeling addiction as a disease because people use it as a crutch. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.^[5](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201404/psychological-crutches-ten-myths-and-three-tips) 

HOWEVER Using in the following forms isn't a great idea (in my opinion):

* *I can't help it! I'm sick, I'm gonna do more dope because of it!*

* *I only do this dope because I have an illness!!!*

* *I'm dopesick and need my drugs to get better! This illness is killing me*

These are examples of using it as a crutch in a negative manner. However, labeling it as a disease and using it to enable yourself to become better is a different story. Once you know you are dealing with a drug addiction disease it can lead to better ways to treat the sickness and can enable people to get better.^[5](http://www.asam.org/public-resources/treatment)

Just my thoughts on it. That's all., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5pctcd/addiction_is_a_disease_vs_choice_and_my_thoughts/

&gt;**Why opioid overdose deaths seem to happen in spurts

&gt;Why do opioid deaths seem to happen in spurts? Experts weigh in and explain how the epidemic is more complicated than it may seem. [Read the full story](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/health/opioids-overdose-deaths-epidemic-explainer/index.html)

&gt;Shared from Apple News

The TL;DR of the article is that fentanyl pressed pills or cut heroin is a dangerous combination that often results in death (as this subreddit so well knows). Now, I'm on Oxycodone (60 5mg tabs per month) and Fentanyl (10 25mcg patcher per month). 

So somehow my parents now think my doctor is prescribing me a deadly combination of medications and must be stopped. I tried explaining to my dad about how it was fentanyl cut heroin or pressed pills with the stuff causing this problem NOT taking medication as prescribed as a fentanyl patch every 72hrs and taking 2 oxycodone 5mgs per day!!! 

I tried so hard to explain that as prescribed what I'm on can't kill me and they seem adamant that I must be off of these drugs.....I'm so frustrated because I don't want to live in pain. Sorry guys for the shit post, just need some support. ughghhhhhhh.

Here she sits brokenhearted

Wondering what to try again

It's just in her heart what she remembers

She Spends time seeking ways to fix her 

But all she has left is pictures

It's just in her heart what she remembers

All in a whirlwind of what she feels

She lived a life fill of pain

She tried to live again

There's nothing she could do.

She just sits there brokenhearted

You just know what is within

Inside is a beautiful young lady

A woman to she will become

An demon she will face

&amp; A victor she will be 

Because even as she sits here brokenhearted

It's what in her heart that she remembers

She spends time seeking out who she is

and that's when I realize

That girl is me.

Brokenhearted, leftover memories, and torn pictures

is all that is left

through the dust and the pain

I will look you in the eye

and tell you it straight...

There is something I can do

because I am you.

TITLE: I had a intrusive thought and the more I think about it, the more I think it's a good idea., POST BODY: When I get my next refill I should tell my parents the doctor discontinued the oxycodone and is just prescribing me Fentanyl patches. Then, I should hide the oxycodone* and keep it all for myself since I usually pick up scripts alone and then my parents take them and hide them from me. They then fight with me every time I request 1 pill and god forbid I ask for 2 or 3 during a bad pain episode. I hate lying to them, but honestly, I think this would be best/better for everyone involved in my medical care.

TITLE: 5mm Mass on my Lungs..., POST BODY: I have a 5mm lung mass according to a chest CT my doctor ordered a few months ago. I am now due for a follow up CT to see if that 5mm mass has grown any. If it has grown, I likely have lung cancer. I go for the CT on the 21st and see my doctor on the 24th. 

I was getting really anxious about this possibility and decided to use Dr. Google to see if my fears were justified. Here is what I found it was about Cushing's Syndrome:

&gt;weight gain, easy bruising, weakness, drowsiness, and fluid retention. Cushing syndrome can also cause high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels (or even diabetes).

According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/prevention-and-early-detection/signs-and-symptoms.html) Cushings is a parananeoplastic syndrome associate with lung cancer. These problems are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Sometimes these syndromes can be the first symptoms of lung cancer. 

That's just great because:

1. Weight Gain: Gained 50lbs in the last year
2. Easy Bruising: I bruise everytime an IV is inserted even when done correctly. I also have a few random bruises that I don't know where they came from.
3. Weakness: Just in general I would say I'm pretty weak
4. Drowsiness: For the past two weeks I've been sleeping for 3+ hours at a time on a daily basis after getting a full night's sleep.
5. High blood pressure: Every doctors visit and time I check it its been abnormally high for a few months.
6. High Blood Sugar: Apparently for the last 3 visits over the last 5 months to my doctors office my blood sugar has been really high.

Those are just symptoms of cushing's syndrome but I have almost all of them. As for general symptoms of lung cancer, I've been coughing and sneezing blood for a week and a half plus I've been breathing really heavily to the point where friends/family are commenting on it. 

I also am at huge risk because I've been sick with chronic pancreatitis for a very long time and have probably received more radiation than I should have over the last few years. My grandmother passed away from lung cancer too, granted she was an EX smoker and had been smoke free for 20 years when she got the cancer. So, I think that puts me at risk too. Luckily, I am not a smoker so I've got that going for me at least.

-----------

I think I'm right to be a little more spooked than the average bear. As a result, I've stopped Googling Lung  Cancer, but feel the need to process my thoughts. Hence why I'm telling Reddit and you are reading this now. I was thinking about it and I just told a friend this:

&gt;Like it sucks, but life has been really hard thus far, it'd be almost nice to relax and know death is coming. I wouldn't choose it, I would never say "I want to die" and I'll be pissed if I am but at the same time there's this sense like "well I guess this is for the best - saving me from more agony that life generally causes"

I hope that makes sense. Thanks for listening.

----------------

TL;DR: I have justifiable reasons to believe I probably have Lung Cancer, if I do, my life has been really hard. I think I might prefer the idea of dying sooner vs. sometime unknown in the distant future. I need to process these thoughts. 

***EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the kind words, you guys seriously fucking rock. I'm gonna try to personally respond to everyone. Thanks so much! Xo.***, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5uvyza/5mm_mass_on_my_lungs/

I had to go for a vascular test because I'm susceptible to blood clots and after we found out it wasn't cancer my doctor wanted to cover all his bases. Anyway, I'm in the room to get an ultrasound done when I notice an orange pill on the floor. Now, this is the hospital, I didn't think much of it, whatever, I still pocketed it regardless. 

The tech and I got to talking and he revealed to me that he too has chronic pain issues and that it's a bitch. For a second I considered turning the pill into him, but then I thought again. I could possibly not be his, could've been a patients. It was by the patient's dressing area, like if its not his he might think I'm weird picking up pills and shit off the floor aaahhhh I'll just pocket it. Why the fuck not. I can google it later. It's probably blood pressure medication.

TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT IT. FOR DAYS.

I was going through my pockets (a good habit) before putting my clothes in the laundry and I noticed this round large orange pill yet again. 

Okay. Hmmmm. WTF let's google this shit....

Well, he cut a deal with LE and for 2-3 years he ratted out just about everybody he could in his city at that time. His sentence was reduced to 8 months. He got 24 months in the end because, he was a bit of an idiot (despite being super smart) and attempted to retrieve some black money and got caught.

I don't think the dude was a bad guy or a piece of shit. In his mind he didn't want to leave his 19 year old wife alone with a 2 year old and newborn to raise by herself with no money, his criminal conviction, and the non-existant higher education of the mother. 

Plus, the way he tells the story, the people he ratted on, or set up, he purposely set up in ways that they'd get the least amount of time possible. He definitely tells the story with remorse and apparently was well connected to a few excellent lawyers that he'd hook the people he ratted on up with so no one would be left to the public defender system. 

The way he tells it though it was a shit storm. Dude ended up making MILLIONS later on in life after prison, *legally* and has helped more people over his 60 years of life than he's harmed. It's definitely interesting when he starts telling his stories. LoL sometimes I don't know if he's a complete liar or truthful but the way his wife acts and responds tells me he's truthful.

BODY: Ya, from what I gather from this dude he really should be in prison for life, but the way he cleaned up his life after his 2 years is absolutely incredible. 

The government probably loves him &amp; his multimillionaire bank account that pays huge taxes. LOL.  Just goes to show you even putting dealers in jail for years is not the answer, these people CAN be rehabilitated, ya know?

Snitching for the sake of snitching is just stupid, but when there real things to protect like a young wife and children, that's a different story.

BODY: The Gray tax area essentially that I'm a legal Nevada resident and pay taxes there. There is no state income tax in Nevada. However, all my doctors are in California so I've been out here for an extended period of time. California has state income tax and despite being in Cali most of the time I don't pay the income tax for it. If I get a job in Cali, California can claim I never really moved to Nevada (which is somewhat true - I split my time and that's legal to do) and I could get charged a boatload of fines and back taxes for the last 5 years if I picked up a job due to the fact that, that would be proof I need to pay up in California state taxes and never actually moved to Nevada.... :/

My dad is currently working on rearranging everything and putting it all in a trust so I can be legal in California again. I did move out to Vegas last year with a boyfriend. Right before my spinal surgery, I was being considered for an executive level position at Caesars Entertainment. I came 2nd to getting the job. They just went with someone with a different skill set than me. It was just as well because I ended up requiring spinal surgery. 

These are seriously first world problems but they're taking a huge toll on myself. Especially considering how controlling my parents are. I think living at home has completely depressed me. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope and I keep telling my parents the solution to this is to get a small studio or a guesthouse of someones to stay in. 

I actually like your idea of going to the gym and hiding there. That would get me out of the house and away from the family and would help with my physical health./weight loss goals.

BODY: No I don't get 1250 a month rent and food free. I pay $450  in rent + i pay for my hematogist at $150 a visit and $125 for my phone bill and I have about $200 at the end of the day to myself. 

I did have a seizure on suboxone in the doctor's office. The doctor tried to lie and say I just passed out but the ER confirmed I had a seizure. I don't know where you think I didn't have said seizure. 

My particular condition is complicated and yes certain drugs morphine and hydroCODONE and demerol make me worse but oxycodone and dialudid and fentanyl and opana is gentler on my condition and as long as I keep it in my system on a rolling consist basis it keeps me at baseline and I don't feel the spasms. 


What I do feel that requires me to deviate from my script is the constant pancreatitis that I've struggled with along with my spinal problems. I drop $500 on pills every two to three months that's where my extra $200 goes towards. I am sticking to my script right now because I spent my money on getting the necklace back by missing three hematology appointments . also I bought that necklace myself many years ago. No one bought it for me. 

I vomit five times a month at least. 

I don't want actual cash and I've explained that to my parents. I want to move out on my own and they could pay rent directly. I just want my lifestyle to reflect how much I actually make or let them allow me to get a job. I haven't always lived at home either. I just moved home this summer following my spinal surgery and now that I'm better I want out. 

Edit: and ya I seek attention and support here the majority of r/opiates is supportive and its a good outlet to share things I can't talk about in my day to day.

They'd give me 3 days worth at a time and now that I'm home they can do it dose by dose. I made a huge mistake allowing that at all. I did it originally out of compassion for what they've been through. 

I moved home following the spine surgery. I couldn't shower on my own for a period of time. Now I'm better but the parents are overbearing. 

What isn't adding up for you? 

I do admit that I like to binge on medication occasionally but honestly I take just enough to function at a level 2/3 pain. 

When I buy extras what I'm buying is a few days of pain free and that's how I justify it. 

Am I addicted? Yes. Am I going to end up on heroin and dead like my brother? Maybe. I like to think that sincd that has yet to happen I'll be okay but I can't tell or predict the future. All I can do is take it day by day and know that today I haven't cracked.

As for rehab I've suggested it already, my parents think psychiatry is a waste of time at this point in there eyes it didn't help my brother and when I went to a dual diagnosis after he died they felt it was overpriced and weren't satisfied with the results. I have a different opinion on that than my parents do. So it's hard. And I'm just fustersted and feel like a prisoner.

BODY: &gt; so they were controlling your script even before you moved home? 

Yes. 

&gt;Were they controlling of all other aspects of your life too or is it their reaction to your rapidly increasing usage? 

Yes, they were/are. It all started after my brother died. I no longer owned my own life. My parents sent me to a dual diagnosis facility in Texas. This was before I was on any opiates. I gained 60 pounds and my father hovered over me to lose it as a result my psych medications were changed to minamize that weight gain. Then when I got sick they were at every doctor's appointment dictating the treatment. When I got diagnosed they stepped back a bit, but from the day I got that first script they were in charge of it. Also if I dress "wrong" I have to change, like they wont even let me dress myself. They don't want my hair in a ponytail, down at all times, there's a lot of restrictions on what I do, how I look, what I eat, and how my medication is managed. They track where I go, watch every uber ride, I'm not allowed to drive... It's like being in abusive romantic relationship except it's my parents not a boyfriend.

&gt; They did this when you were out of state? They made trips to where you were living with your BF to dole out your meds?

They put the boyfriend in charge of it. We bought a safe and the boyfriend would dole them out. It was weird as fuck and caused tension in my relationship that ultimately ended because of it.

After my neck surgery I didn't want to break up with my guy but my parents were so upset that he didn't show at the hospital that they insisted I break up with him. I did so because I didn't have the energy at the time to rebel and fight them.

&gt; What isn't adding up is that your stories show that you're in deep denial. 

Well, let's draw a timeline to see this.....

* 2010 is when my brother died.

* 2011 is when I went to the dual diagonsis place to prevent me killing myself over my brother.

* 2012 is when I got really sick with conistent projectile vomiting almost daily. 

* 2013 is when I was diagnosed and got my first 5mg daily oxycodone script after a doctor intervened when a 3rd degree sunburn over 1/3rd of my body didn't hurt as much as my pancreatic problems did. 

* 2014 is when I had the seizure on the suboxone after being clean at the time except for tramadol (which I was in w/ds from when I took the suboxone and had the seizure) My doctor at the time recommend the suboxone after being on methadone for just four months and before the methadone I was only on 15mgs of oxycodone daily. 

* 2015  I was off of medication and immobilized

* 2016 I was prescribed 5mg PRN it progressed to be 30mgs daily by December

* January 2017 - Fentanyl patches were scripted in lieu of 10mg 3x a day. Oxy was decreased to 5mg 2x/day

* February 20th 2017 I pawned my necklace and bought thirty 30mg oxys. 

* March 1st 2017 I have decided to no longer use any narcotics outside of my script because I was reading documents and there's a paragraph in the trust that states if I get arrested on drug related charges I lose access to the trust which would be throwing away tons of cash. I got my necklace back too. 

* March 3rd 2017 25 days later I have 3 30mgs left meaning I went through 27 oxycodones in 10 days. That is about ONE 3-4 blues a day.

So yes, there's no denying my usage has increased. I completely acknowledge where I'm at. I've had spikes in use before and going back down to my prescribed dosages has never been an issue. I expect I'll be fine going back tot he fentanyl patches and 2 oxys daily, ya know? 

In any event, I'm feeling a bit overhwemled and need a break so I'm gonna go chill for a bit. Thanks :-).

I don't (think) I'm lying to myself as much as I believe I'm in a very difficult position. I actually don't want any of the cash. The less cash I have in hand the better. 

What I DO want is an apartment, high speed internet, a job, a nice gym membership and what nots. 

&gt;if I thought she would end up blowing it on pills and heroin and be dead in 5 years. Not because I want to control her life but because I want to preserve it

Here's the way I look at that, and perhaps it's a bit delusional, perhaps not, I *never* touched drugs until I was 22. When I was 22 I tried Marijuana for the first time out of desperation and cut out alcohol because it made me worse. 

I haven't had more than maybe a sip here and there of an alcoholic beverage simply because my pancreas hates it. Then when I was 23 I was desperate to get out of pain that I gave up my luxury of eating food and had to get a feeding tube installed.

So now, here I am 23 I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't eat, I don't use MMJ because it makes me so hunger that's counter productive. I'm left to a script of 15mgs of oxycodone daily and that's that, until my previous pain specialist put me on methadone for four months and had me withdraw from it. After I was clean I was put on suboxone to which I had a seizure on. 

Upon being kicked out of her clinic because she felt she couldn't handle my case I was on I kid you not 20 different medications with 10 of them trying to tackle the pain, nausea &amp; vomiting. That went on for 8 months. 

Finally, at 25 I got in touch with a great doctor and he has guided me quite well in terms of managing my case. I also decided then that the not working thing was stupid and moved to Vegas with a boyfriend when I 26 so that I could get a job. 

Unfortunately, I came out of that with neck surgery and my parents forced me back to cali "save money," "you're too ill," "you need us...." so I broke up with the boyfriend and back to cali I went. I also had the feeding tube removed because my parents disliked it and didn't think it was helping. It was in fact helping but came with its own set of problems. 

Now I'm 28 and absolutely miserable. That's basically the story of the last 6 years and in that time I haven't gone to heroin, the most I've deviated from my script would be this most recent purchase of 30 blues. 

So in my eyes, I'm pretty strong. I've refused heroin everytime it's been offered, I've stayed off the needle, I've been open and honest with my therapist about my struggles, I've cooperated with my parents, rarely fighting with them and I am just doing my thing the best way I can. It's very hard when my parents leave me with no breathing room. I'm worn down by the day-to-day.

I was going somewhere with this, but hopefully that gives you more insight into what's going on. I can't control what happens tomorrow but I can control right now and today I'm not spending more on pills. today I'm not buying heroin, today I'm not running away and so forth.

BODY: &gt;Have you ever thought that maybe your parents aren't out to get you and that you don't know best?? I know it kinda goes against the sub not to enable you but I am pretty sure you are sitting in a ton of delusion and self pity.

I'm confused? I opened this post stating:

&gt;After making this very raw &amp; emotional post I realized I'm lying to myself... However, a few of you... pointed out how quick of a progression it was. I agree. It is quick.
I have many justifications for why I take and do what I do some are rooted in truth and others are not. Despite this, some things are changing.

I would say that's pretty honest, is it not? I understand I'm solely responsible for my actions, I can only control what I do and how I react to things. I feel really beaten down by my parents doing things like ***asking me to change clothes*** if they ***dislike** what I'm wearing that I no longer even care about what I want to wear and let them dictate it ( a mistake - I know, but it is what it is )

&gt; You have to remember that you are an addict and you have a mental disease. 

Yes, I suffer from mental illness, yes, I'm addicted and very dependent on my medication but is it isn't the *only* thing going on with me. I am also ill to a point where a *feeding tube* was necessary at one point in time.

&gt; Pawning your shit for drugs is not good behavior. 

It was in the pawnshop for 12 days. No, it's not good behavior and I'm at least capable of getting it back (quickly too)

&gt;You literally were hospitalized because you can't even stay hydrated. You fail to do practice the most basic levels of self care

I'm going to take ******HUGE****** issue with this. I was hospitalized because of a major headache likely due to a vomiting episode that went on for 12hrs before I went in. When you vomit as much as I do it's not so much about being able not practicing selfcare it's about being able to hold down food and water because your system is so screwy. 

I've been through every treatment available to me for pancreatic condition, ERCPs with Sphincterotomies, I take creon daily, used a jejunal feeding tube for 3 years, had my gallbladder removed, bile ducts have had stents placed and drained, my gastrointestinal system is a mess. I have severe ulceration at the lower bits of my intestines that causes bleeding whenever I use the restroom. I don't talk pills to my pancreatic specialist either and he's even stated, "it's symptom management now!" do you know what the treatment is for pancreatitis flares?

1. Pain medication 
2. Nausea medication
3. Fluids IV
4. Zantac
5. Bowel Rest from 3-5 days of IV fluids only.


That's the issue, I'm at the end of my rope on what more can be done about my pancreatic problems. So, we've got a decent plan in place, I only head down to the ER if the vomiting goes on past 12hrs. Usually go in at the 48hr mark otherwise it's up to me to keep it in check at home. That's where things get tricky for me.

&gt;I think that you are gonna need to really improve your self care if you want your parents respect

What would you suggest I do to improve self care? I walk the dog daily (30min) vomiting or not. I just joined a gym yesterday, I'm on top of my medical care and regularly see my doctors, I watch my diet close and stay away from trigger foods, I stretch daily and do a mini-yoga routine in my room, I shower daily, I do my own laundry, I don't ever overdraft my bank account, I fix food for myself, I pay for my own psychotherapy and hematologist, I want to work, I want to progress, I graduated college at my worst, I take it day by day, so I'm really confused when you're telling me I need to improve self care?


* Note: Short of removing my pancreas, I don't know what more can be done.

BODY: I have a severe pancreatic condition to the point where a feeding tube was necessary and to the point where I'm vomiting for about 12 days out of the week in 5 separate vomiting episodes that last an average of two days. I've told my doctors I need more but they're too afraid to prescribe more, so it becomes very difficult to balance.

&gt;Don't like it? Stop being a financial leech and leave. You're only staying there because they pay for you.

No, I'm home because they insist on it right now. I've been seeking out work on my own terms. I think I found something that pays under the table. So that'll be good/helpful.

I disagree. I'm fully aware that I'm addicted to my medications. 

&gt;You'd get along just fine without your medications.

You must not know what pain feels like. They don't stick feeding tubes and crap in people if they're perfectly healthy. Ya know? These pain meds are a last resort for me. And yes, I like to get high. So fucking what I can BARELY eat, I can't drink, I can't smoke, I am very limited in the things I can and cannot do. So because I have medical issues I'm a worse addict than you?

Here's an interesting question. I've got chronic pancreatitis. There is no proof of said pancreatitis anymore because about a year ago my body "adjusted" and my pancreas learned how to handle the enzyme levels but I still vomit uncontrollably and am in a ton of pain. The only way to go in to tell if I'm "lying" or not is to go in with a scope and LOOK at my pancreas, except  that procedure to do so is so dangerous it could KILL me.

By your laws and standards I wouldn't be able to get painkillers because there's "no (recent) proof" yet it is well documented that people with chronic pancreatitis have enzyme levels that no longer reflect what is happening to the patient. 

Thank God I don't live in your state, I'd be dead or on heroin with your absurd 7 day law because I wouldn't be able to get past it to begin with.

The law in my opinion over reaches its boundaries when it comes to medical care for people. As an American, I have basic human rights. One of those rights is not to be discriminated against for a disability. When the government steps in and takes control of my medications and does not let my doctor do his job, I could make the argument that my right to adequate healthcare is being violated.

BODY: I have a $50 copay to see my doctor monthly. Now multiply that out by a month **that's $200 right there.**  

Then I'm on fentanyl, but my insurance won't cover so **that's $200 a month right now.** (working on it but it isn't easy)

Next, an uber ride is required to get to my now-weekly appointments so instead of my bill being $20 once a day total, **it's now $80. I don't drive.**

So we've got a financial burden of $480 vs my regular $270. Getting a script has nearly doubled in cost. 

Then, I have serious pancreatic problems. We're in the process of discussing removing my nonfunctioning pancreas that's causing trouble. I vomit so frequently throughout the month that my energy levels are very low. Getting out to my pain doctor is a *chore* he's about an hour away and it's usually a 4-6 hour endeavour because his office is busy and I'm always waiting at least an hour to see him. It takes the entire day which is what it is. However, I'm utterly exhausted by the end of the day. 

Now imagine I have a job (something I want to do in the foreseeable future) The doctor's only open monday through friday which means I either take a pay cut if my company allows me to go to my appointment or I remain jobless and that's a terrible position to be stuck in.  

So yah. It would be a huge burden on me. It's basically the government saying I can't have a quality of life by no fault of my own.

At the hospital I go to I'm super lucky because every year there's a seminar and surgery symposium about it. I participated in the one in January 2013. So, I've had doctors who have come up to me in the ER and say, "I skipped the symposium, what's going on?" and those are easily the best. The worst is educating doctors that think they know-it-all. 

I believe in a balance mixture of things.

20% - Medication management (psychiatry)

Who knows, but as bedtime approaches I can safely say today was another day without heroin. 

If that philosophy makes any sense.

BODY: It does make a difference. When I was a kid my mom was stay-at-home. Something happened though when we became young adults. My parents lost control of my brother who as you know tragically passed away. My parents were loving and devoted to us, so I really don't understand why we are where we are now, but I will viciously defend the fact that despite my brother's death, my mom was a good mom.

I think we've just had to deal with extra stressors that were abnormal. We went to 3 different high schools in 4 years, a kid beat up my brother for absolutely no reason and he shattered his shoulder which I believe started his addiction problems. We had a family stalker growing up too (he's currently serving 12yrs) and the instructions were literally, if kidnapped, pitch the biggest fight possible, you rather die on the spot than go with the stalker. And I had an abusive boyfriend when I was 16.

It was just a mess. I firmly believe my mom is/was a victim of circumstances and bad luck vs. intentionally being a bad mom.

BODY: Thank you. At this point it is what it is. I credit my hematologist with keeping me off heroin and essentially saving my life. He's the one who said:

&gt;We as doctors take an oath to do no harm. We are just as responsible for undermedicating a patient and leading them to a heroin overdose as we are for overmedicating a patient and causing a perscription medication overdose. 

His office is super comfy and he administers IV medications there including dilaudid. I sometimes go there to avoid the ER. I'll be vomiting like nutso and he'll hook me up with IV fluids, zantac, zofran, benadryl and dilaudid. It's a 5hour wait to see him too, but while you're waiting you get taken care of. So, it's really awesome. I bring my laptop and chillax.

I also remember being on tramadol with an old pain doctor.

If you actually take the time to look at my post history you'll see that I mostly comment and make helpful and/or uplifting comments on other people's situations and posts. Then I personally think my posts  can be labeled as:

* 1/3rd negative/i need help with my life
*  1/3rd neutral
* 1/3rd uplifting/happy/positive

It just drives me batty that people seem to hold onto my negative posts and label me from them and then insist on following me around the subreddit pointing it out ***only*** when it suits them.

BODY: ooooooooo Yes, you are not wrong, I was tempted to post but I'm not sure what more I could tell /u/Thekkktookmybaby than what has already been said. Except that I know someone loves them and I know what it's like to lose someone you love unexpectedly. My brother and cousin were both dead before they were 30. It's devestating what that does to your loved ones. Imho if you can find ONE reason, even if it's a crappy reason to NOT kill yourself then you do have hope. 

I inheritantly believe no one is hopeless and suicide is something that should nto be taken lightly. If you're really considering it my advice is to wait until you're more clear headed and less emotional to do it. That way you're not implusively  acting on it.

Suicide isn't a permanent problem to a situation that is likely temporary. I'm not saying your problems are insignificant. In fact, they're quite serious and need to be treated with respect. I just don't think suicide is a respectful way to treat problems. There's nothing shameful about it but is it what you really want for yourself and your loved ones?

Is there something you could try to risk to make it better? Think about it. If there's a chance things could get better if you did x,y, or z differently, just do xy or z. You've truly got nothing to lose!

&amp; I agree the hotlines are crappy as fuck. If you want to actually talk - I'll listen. That goes for anyone in this subreddit.

I was just about suicidal. It's been 2 years since i got back into managed care and it's only in the last 3 months that I feel like I finally have a chance at a normal life.

BODY: Jejunal feeding tube is a feeding tube that bypasses your stomach and delivers nutrition to your jejunum or basically the start of my intestines. Meaning for the 3 years that I had it I did not eat and was constantly hungry because nothing was ever in my stomach. It was an odd feeling of hunger like not outright starving but definitely aware of the lack of stuff in the stomach.

According to Reddit:

&gt;Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.


Reddit karma is one of the gamification techniques used to engage users on reddit. You get more karma when your posts/comments get upvoted, and lose some when they get downvoted.


Does that make more sense? They're reddit specific tools/options/things.

After he died I came around here pretty frequently trying to understand what the hell happened to him. I just couldn't grasp it for the longest time. So don't feel bad if all you see is scary, that's all I saw at first too. It wasn't until I got to know people and their stories that my opinions changed. They were surprisingly similar. Then, by no fault of my own and the pure chance of it all I got diagnosed with a rare illness that requires me to use oxycodone. This subreddit keeps me off of the heroin and I take that reminder seriously.

BODY: It sucks but it's pretty spot on. I only break the waiting rule, simply because I've been going long enough and just ask, "do you have it in stock?" and not once have they not had it in stock. I usually do go run to the restroom in the next building over while they fill or whatever, so there's that too. I'm not like watching them or I get snacks and wait outside. 

The other rule I break is the "cash" payment one. BUT ONLY when my insurance will not cover a medication. This last time I had them hold it for a week while my doctor fussed with insurance, so even though I had to buy it upfront this month too, I'm hoping insurance will have it covered for the next fill. I also put cash in quotes because chances are I'm not paying with actual cash it's going on a debit or credit card or something of that sort. 

I also have a relationship with my pharmacy, so I'm not too worried about issues, they sorta know my story and know I get other medications but fill them at CVS because its easy enough to use CVS's system for non-narcotics. But Benzos and Narcotics go to them because they always have it in stock without hassle.

Also so far he has only been issued a traffic citation, wonder if he actually ended up catching more charges for it later:

&gt;Police found drug paraphernalia in the car, but so far the man has been issued only a traffic citation. He likely will face more charges later. 

Getting pulled over was the best thing that could've ever happened to this guy despite the police charges. The article/Cop puts it best:

That's kinda my attitude at the moment and that might be fucking me up. Ya know? Like a sense of entitlement because, what? He stole my identity? It's an insane situation. 

But I think the bottom line is right, I'm addicted, I'm in a lot of pain, and I need to just stick to my script. I also need to get a job, dad swore up and down to me this morning that he was working as best he can to move things out of my personal name and into a trust and/or business so I can start to build my own life. 

Which is progress? I guess? 

In the meantime he wants to take away my bank account and restrict phone/computer access and be at every doctor's appointment. I might seek out a lawyer and see what I can do about the situation on my own, but I think my best bet is going to play nice with my dad and hey, it wouldn't kill me to just stick to my script as prescribed.

BODY: I get to find out in person. He's coming to my next appointment. What's probably going to come out of that is the following:

* Continuing the Fentanyl Patches
* Removing the Oxycodone
* Replacing it with something for breakthrough like Opana or Dilaudid and only 15 - 20 tablets of those medications.

That would for those times when the pain really does suck not just when I feel I need it. Worst case, they put me just on the Fentanyl alone and call it a day.

But I don't think he's going to cause a discontinuation of my medication because he understands the situation to a degree. He claims he just wants to hear the talk/how those appointments go and not say anything. We'll see. I'll work on it with him.

Like right now, I'm at my hematologists office getting IV fluids, nausea meds, zantac, and yes, pain medication IV. There's definitely a need for it, my bloodwork this morning shows slightly elevated pancreatic enzymes which means I now need to go on a clear liquid diet for the next few days.

BODY: well the overall dosage of medication comes down if I get 15 5mg opana tablets that's about the equivalent of 150mg of oxycodone versus the 300mg I normally get. Ultimately, the doctor could just prescribe 10mg of Oxycodone with 15 pills. It's all the same thing at the end of the day. I just think calling it something different helps my dad get past the "popular street drug" attitude and into the "medical need" attitude part of it.

LOCK that dose up, do what you have  to but you NEED to take one dose the morning of otherwise, you might test negative and your doctor might kick you out because of that.

NEXT load up on some lope, benadryl and dxm. The /r/opiates [withdrawal survival guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ixrp3/the_definitive_withdrawal_survival_guide/) is a godsend. If you have any lyrica or gabapentin on hand, use that. That'll take care of most of your W/D issues. 

Good luck to you and whatever you do, do not call your doctor about this unless you want to lose your script.

2. In your posts, never say your age or name, or if you do - make up a fake age and stick with it, or you could always make up a fake name and stick with that.
3. Don't click on links through private messages, someone could send you an ip grabber and get your ip through that, then get your location.
5. Check your post history, make sure you never posted your location, names, school, etc.
6. Your Reddit username. Have you ever used this username on any other websites/games? If so, create a new reddit account just for this subreddit. There's a website (not going to list it just incase) that can give people access to your email, first name, last name, through simply searching your reddit name if you've ever used it on a website that's been hacked in the past. 

These might seem like common sense, but they can really fuck up your life if you don't take these precautions.  Please be safe everyone.

BODY: LOL in terms of drug shows and drug related crimes like Intervention or Drugs, Inc., I find that to be very true. 

Before my own personal experience with my brother's addiction and my subsequent addiction, I didn't understand and thought drug addicts needed to get over it, and live better lives.

One key thing is I never thought they were hopeless unless, they committed a violent crime alongside their addiction.

Then, as things changed for me personally, I found myself becoming very empathetic towards drugs, addicts, dealers and the families of those struggling with addicted loved ones. I still struggle with the concept of committing violent crimes in the throes of addiction and withdrawals, but, now I understand it better. At least I understand better than before. 

So, there has definitely been a huge shift in the way I think about these sorts of things.

BODY: Yep. I'm a chronic pain patient. I have a pancreatic condition. I was abusing my script and did go to using it as directed. The way I saw it was I need this medication to function and running out early puts me at so much risk. I finally decided the risk of buying illicitly and the risk of getting kicked out of my clinic wasn't worth abusing my mediations. Mind you it's only been a month of doing things "correctly," but, so far so good and I intend to keep it that way. 

I did have a hospitalization recently where I was on IV dilaudid for 5 days so I think that contributed and my doctor has temporarily increased my at home dosage, but come Wednesday I should be back to my regular prescribed dose. The point is, I'm not doing anything outside of my doctor's recommendations or instructions.

I think it's similar to that decision to quit, if you're determined to succeed, you're going to succeed, ya know?

BODY: Yep Opiate Euphoria in the short-term works incredibly for depression. Unfortunately, it is not a viable long term solution to that sort of thing. The PST is probably mild enough to not produce a strong immediate euphoria or antidepressant effect. Whereas it in pill form is a more concentrated dosage all in one spot. At least that'd be my guess. I can't say for certain though.

Depression is a beast to 'beat' and in my opinion depression isn't something you ever overcome or beat, instead it is something that you learn how to live with and something you can use to your advantage. After all, we cannot know what true euphoria or happiness feels like without ever experiencing depression first.

&gt;So I get to work this morning and like every Friday the first thing I do is run across the road to collect my weekly mail. And opening my post office box to see nothing in there immediately fills me with the dread and anxiety of having to go straight back to do a full days work right as WD is starting to set in. I work at a dealership in the car service centre. So while I'm pulling the first car of the day into the workshop for the mechanics to get to work on - I open up the centre console and what should I find? None other than a full large bottle of OC 20s just sitting there staring at me. The car is scheduled for a clutch replacement with parts we won't even have in stock till Monday - so whoever these belong do didn't think much of leaving them in a car that they wouldn't even get back for at least 4 days. Obviously I took a bunch - 12 to be exact! But it wouldn't have even been a quarter of what was in the bottle. Not to mention the label on it was ripped off, and the bottle itself actually looked kinda old. So I'm thinking these might not even be script legitimate. Either way i was staring down the barrel of WD at the start of long ass shift so nothing was gonna stop me really.. in fact it's gonna take all the willpower I have not to go back into the car and grab a bunch more - or even just swiping the whole damn bottle! Anyways I'm feelin great and sorted till the mail gets here. Dunno if it was JJ but if it was he truly works in mysterious ways :) hope your all set for the long weekend ahead and feeling as good as I do right now!

BODY: &gt;If I didn't have serious chronic pain, I would have checked into a detox long ago. I've tried going without medication, and I just cannot.

I'm the exact same way. I can handle withdrawals, after all, I spend a good amount of my existence vomiting and with a runny tummy, going from hot and cold like no other when I'm unwell, anyway. So handling the withdrawals seems doable to me. What's not doable is the amount of pain that follows through with withdrawals. I have a pancreatic condition that causes chronic pancreatitis and even with IV pain medication on board at the hospital I can only get down to a 4 or 3 at best in terms of pain. It's absolutely terrifying.

&gt; would share more about myself, but I don't want to self identify

That's smart. I shared too much and got identified recently. It was very unnerving.

&gt;but basically a Dr. injured the shit out of my insides about a year and a half ago. There is nothing they can do for me. I catheter myself daily now to urinate, and several times a week to instill medicines in my bladder.

That sounds awful/horrific. Some doctors really shouldn't have medical licenses. It's scary what can and does happen to people and then when you require narcotics you're basically cast aside and told to deal with it by the medical community when they worsened your issues! It's disgusting.

BODY: I first started needing drugs when I was 24. I'm 28 now. So that's 4 years. The first two years was rocky. I was never on more than 15mg of oxycodone when a stupid doctor put me on 5mg of methadone. I tried that and four months later my doctor decided "it wasn't working" so she withdrew me from it which was the worst feeling of my entire life. After that I attempted suboxone at that doctor's recommendation but, had a seizure on it. At which point, I was 100% off drugs for 8 months and it was grueling. I was on 5 other non-narcotic medications and nothing was working. After 8 months of that I got put on narcotic medication again and replaced 5 different meds with just 1 narcotic. It's been this way for 2 years now and my doctor even says he expects me to need narcotics for the foreseeable future and while he has a plan to lower my medication a bit he says I shouldn't go off of it. So that's kinda my story.

BODY: Yep. I totally agree. Also here are some other tips that can help prevent you from getting doxxed:

1. If you 100% don't want to be caught, always use a vpn (but not sure if you can on reddit).
2. In your posts, never say your age or name, or if you do - make up a fake age and stick with it, or you could always make up a fake name and stick with that.
3. Don't click on links through private messages, someone could send you an ip grabber and get your ip through that, then get your location.
5. Check your post history, make sure you never posted your location, names, school, etc.
6. Your Reddit username. Have you ever used this username on any other websites/games? If so, create a new reddit account just for this subreddit. There's a website (not going to list it just incase) that can give people access to your email, first name, last name, through simply searching your reddit name if you've ever used it on a website that's been hacked in the past. 

These might seem like common sense, but they can really fuck up your life if you don't take these precautions.  Please be safe everyone.

BODY: So if you rate anxiety from 1-10 at different stages of the anxiety you can use different tools to improve the moment for instance:

* **7-10 anxiety level:** This is the time to work on relaxing with deep breathing and distraction techniques.
* **4-6 anixiety level:** Journaling works well at this level as does creative calming art work and directly addressing what is making you feel upset, this is also a good spot for meditation
* **1-3 anxiety level:** Here you're best off working on solutions to your problem and what is making you anxious. Essentially problem solving is most effective for helping your anxiety when it's not over the top.

I belong to a few chronic pain groups and each one blames the illicit market for the drug epidemic and illicit fentanyl and carafentanyl for the OD surge.

I belong to a few addiction groups and each one blames the illicit market for the drug epidemic and illicit fentanyl and carafentanyl for the OD surge.

Just think about that both pain patients and addicts agree illicit fentanyl is the problem not patients in fucking pain and need.

TITLE: Tolerance Break!, POST BODY: Does anyone else do this on a regular basis? I haven't been around these past few days because I've been on a self imposed tolerance break and miserable as fuck. 

I've taken myself entirely off my fentanyl patch for the past 4 days and have been taking no more than 40mgs of hydrocodone just so my body doesn't spaz out too terribly.

The first day I took 40mgs of hydcodone, the following two days I took 30mgs and today I hope to only take 40mgs. I had to do this for two reasons. 

First reason if I didn't do this I was going to be forced to go through withdrawals whether or not I liked it so I decided to take control of the situation. I had a few major pain episodes earlier in the month and had to double up for a few days making me short on my script overall.

The second reason is I was feeling like my tolerance was getting too high and I needed this break. It's miserable but I think it'll be worth it.

I'm going to try to do two more days with no more than 20mgs of hydrocodone just to get by. I'm using an old script of hydrocodone, because I'm getting out of illicitly purchasing drugs and had them in the back of my medicine cabinet. It's funny how useful hydrocodone when you're feeling the burn.

TL;DR: Traded 25mcg fentanyl patches and 10mg of opana for 40mgs of hydrocodone max for the last week.

BODY: I've mentioned it before but /u/inthea215's method to [spotting fake pills](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4v8ua6/are_these_legit_k9s/d5wghzc/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) is spot on:

&gt;They look pretty legit. I always hate these posts tho because if they did happen to be fake people are always like wow what the fuck my asshole dealer ripped me off when likely your dealer paid just as much for fake ones as real ones and he wasn't able to tell himself just like how your kinda unsure.

&gt;But the main things I look for is for consistancy. All the pills should look exactly the same if some are a little thicker or the lettering on some deeper than others that's a give away. I can't tell that from this picture but one thing I can tell is that it looks like the edges on these pills are raised a little that's a sign of a bad press. I used to work in pharm plants pressing pills I forget what exactly it means but it means we did something wrong if there are edges. Some pills do have them and are produced like that but it's very rare. They should be smooth around the side. I hope you understand what I mean by the edges sticking up.

Another clue is if you have mismatched pills in the same batch. That's an indication that they are pressed.

BODY: Yep. He locked up my Opana's 10s up in a pill dispenser that gives me 1 per day. He opened it up 5 times for me to avoid a hospital stay. Which, unfortunately, was unavoidable at the end of the day. He left town about 2 weeks ago. 5-7 days ago I found 20 Hydro 10s in the back of my medicine cabinet that I didn't even know where there. So, they've been helping me through this period of time where I'm in between my supply &amp; refill. 

Now, let's say you're 100% correct in saying it was easy to commit to that knowing I had a bottle sitting in the back ... like I was being sneaky or someshit:

1. Why does it even matter? 
2. I don't see how 20 Hydro 10s makes it "easy" to lock up 30 Opana 10s? There's a world of difference between those two drugs. 20 hydro 10s are not anywhere close to my tolerance...

Don't get me wrong they're helpful and no, they had nothing to do with my decision to try to be better about my meds especially since I only found them a week after dad left and 3 weeks after agreeing to lock shit up in the dispenser. I had no knowledge of these before I locked up the meds.

In any event, I've been so tired I haven't been able to do much. I haven't been online at all. I've been sleeping 12-15 hour days and really haven't been able to do much at all.

I was just thinking about what our community is about and remembered an old article from 2015. It is titled "[The Heroin Heroine of Reddit](https://backchannel.com/the-heroin-heroine-of-reddit-a2fffcc2a25b)," yes, it features our very own /u/traceyh415.

The best bit in the article, aside from live saving guru work, is this portion:

&gt;In the thriving community of r/opiates, in which posts featuring new drug experiments or glamour shots of freshly acquired illicit goods are not uncommon, Tracey’s outreach efforts have helped to foster a rare haven. Intravenous drug users are often tarred in the public eye as reckless misfits, but as with any subculture, the ways in which individuals approach their habit vary widely. On the more responsible end of the spectrum are those users who ensure they always have naloxone on hand, just in case, as well as clean needles. The mother of r/opiates helps spread these safer behaviors.

Honestly, for me, that's what r/opiates is really about. I'm wondering what r/opiates is and means for you? , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/6dkaml/what_our_community_is_really_about_an_article/

Me &amp; /u/giftload spent some time on here talking about pain, traveling and life in general. I am so not prepared for this. I received a note a few days ago from him stating he was moving to hospice care and that he probably won't be around anymore.

If any of you remember or know u/giftload is diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and would sometimes share his incredible drug stashes here on r/opiates. 

He did mention that he would post a message here &amp; there, but probably not much, and asked me to tell you all he said "hi." So, I'm passing along the note and hoping people here will leave him a note in respect saying goodbye. 

It's not often we get a chance to say bye to someone here. So that in itself is a opportunity I didn't want to deprive anyone here of.

BODY: For those who aren't abusing it, it still packs a punch and that's why it's scripted. Anyway, I saw the documentary too. I really liked it. It laid out both sides without a judgemental tone to it and lets the viewer come to their own conclusions. 

I think also back in the day the drug companies were pushing oxy as if it weren't as bad as it is, doctors didn't know what a problem it'd be and weren't properly warning their patients due to it. I think now we know better and know these things come with a lot of strings attached.

When I made the final decision to go back on opiates it was very calculated and even now I kinda regret it.

I made the mistake of not taking my morning dose since I was getting medications there, it took over an hour for them to stick me. 6 tries, sucked because they couldn't even get a working IV and just butterfly me for blood. None of it was having it. I "wrongfully" got overly excited when they finally got a fucking vein. I need to taper down going so often because, even though it's keeping me out of the hospital, I can't be so dependent on them. Plus it costs me $150 a visit. Which is hurting my pocketbook.

When I explained that I had a seizure on the suboxone, and was just on tramadol he literally said, "too bad for you then."

BODY: It's interesting because I'm probably the whitest prerson you know. I moved to Chicago once when I was chasing after a boyfriend. It lasted 6 months. I lived on the far north side worked M-F from 8am-5pm and went to a Saturday Statistics class on the ***south side***. Kennedy King College. I was naive and stuck out big time. At the end of it all though it was the best life experience ever. I ended up tutoring more than half the class and they'd walk me to and from the bus area to class and whatnot. Learned a lot more than statistics that term.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-07-30 00:59:56, SCORE: 1
BODY: Actually, there’s a lot of things that Europe &amp; other countries on a whole is ahead of the USA on. For instance, [the USA incarcerates 4x more people than the world’s average](http://www.nccdglobal.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/factsheet-us-incarceration.pdf) &amp; it is known to imprison up to six times as many people as do nations of comparable populations. 

Then there are things on individual countries agendas that have proved to be much better for crime than the USA as a whole. For instance things like [red light districts](http://www.humanityinaction.org/knowledgebase/312-the-audacity-of-tolerance-a-critical-analysis-of-legalized-prostitution-in-amsterdam-s-red-light-district) and [marijuana laws](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/adhoc/cannabis-legislation-europe)  have been shown to be excellent programs that decreases crime, improves public health, loosens social stigma allowing people to openly receive help for their problems.

Obviously, those are other examples on a wide-range of topics. Portugal has specifically made an impact according to [this](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/04/18/524380027/in-portugal-drug-use-is-treated-as-a-medical-issue-not-a-crime), [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifh8iUpLDVAhXBwFQKHXchDWYQFggvMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicaldaily.com%2Fportugal-drug-experiment-heroin-decriminalizing-drugs-382598&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlzaTbAWMsw9D6_8wAsJUEGI18Dg) &amp; [this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/). 

Whereas the news in America focuses on [this](https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf), [this](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html), and [this](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/03/daily-chart-3).

So, obviously Portugal is doing a lot more for their country’s people than America is and there is something to be said about that despite the population/sample size taken!

I feel bad for him too but he sleeps on a very comfy couch with his bed and lotsa blankets so I can't feel too bad. He's just a nuisance in bed with me squirms about and stuff and it's difficult for me because I sweat a lot at night and move around bunch and with the dog in my bed he disrupts my sleep because I can't move around. As much as I hate keeping him separate it's done wonders for my health to be able to sleep the night. So, that means a lot.

BODY: I vehemently disagree with this. Think about it this way, say you smoke cigarrettes to keep from smoking H. Are you considered clean? Y.E.S. even though cigarettes are a drug too, it is being used as a lesser of the two evils tool to help you along. That's how I view suboxone, suboxone is a good way to get and stay clean. I guess it must have to do with your definition of clean though. For me, if you're maintaining yourself on Subs, without any dangerous or illegal activity, you are in fact clean.

Clean doesn't always equal abstinence. Suboxone is literally a drug for addiction the same way prozac treats depression. Subs treat opiate addiction. Not to mention when someone tells me they're clean it just sounds arrogant to me. I respect their ability to stay off drugs but I just really hate the word.

Edit: Plus I hate the word clean in general. It's not a good fit to describe abstinence from illicit opioid activity.

BODY: You did ***nothing*** wrong and if he's sending you messages it sounds like he isn't ready *still* to take responsibility for what he did. 

So what if he was curious, blah, blah, blah. Doesn't make your feelings about it any less serious. It doesn't mean it wasn't rape/molestation. It doesn't mean just because your cousin can justify it, you can understand that justification. 

It is very natural to feel the way you are feeling. Your innocence as ripped away from you without your consent. That's a jarring thing for an adult rape victim and way worse for a child. It screws you up fundamentally. 

Sounds to me like you need two concepts in your life right now:

* 1a. [Forgiveness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-addiction-connection/201409/the-psychology-forgiveness)
* 1b. [Self Forgiveness](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11454/10-ways-to-forgive-yourself-let-go-of-the-past.html)
* 2a. [Radical Acceptance](https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2015/10/04/what-it-really-means-to-practice-radical-acceptance/)
* 2b. [Self-Love](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/self-esteem/art-20047976)

I hope that helps. Also incase you decide to not click the links, I'm talking about using forgiveness as a tool towards things like radical acceptance and as a way to help you. Your cousin doesn't even need to know you forgive them. With all of these concepts It's not about your cousin, it's about you not letting their condescending attitude rule your life.

It sounds like you would benefit from /r/raisedbynarcissists they have a lot of helpful information for dealing with unruly parents like yours. If I were you I would lay low and let things calm down and then I'd make a sincere letter of sorts. Something that validates her concerns &amp; feelings while maintaining your innocence and reinforce your love for her and desire for a healthy relationship. 

I would do this regardless of getting kicked out or not. If you want help writing it - I can give ya a hand i'm good at that. Also, you might need to radically accept that she wont change and that you can only control your reactions to her. You cannot control what she does. Ya know? If that makes sense. Also, remember this is just how it is right now. It by no means it's going to be forever. things can change in an instant.

BODY: Regardless of what you think about propaganda or America Vs. Europe, and the differences in laws, there's no denying that America's war on drugs is failing miserably. All I'm saying is it's time to try something new in that regard. 

You just asked for a comparable example and I gave it to you. You disliked my answer so you called it a circle jerk. I am of the opinion that it's very relevant and these discussions are important because that's how you "Make America Great Again," just saying it means nothing, every american needs to take steps to improve the country. 

A lot of people think America is the greatest, that's only if you're a healthy white wealthy male. Check your privilege and open your mind to think about the lack of education and poverty in our country. 

You see, the USA may have a lot of economic wealth in the country however, it is held by about 1% to the population. We have Americans starving in middle America as ife we were a 3rd world country and our health care system is barbaric. Not to mention we are fucking stupid. Ranking well behind our european counterparts in education. For instance in [math the USA is ranked right behind Slovakia](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/). 

Just Saying.

Well this morning I slept on my hand overnight somehow and woke up to an ice cold, super tight, white and swollen hand. It took a lot of hand squeezing, massaging and applying heat to get the blood flow going again but it really spooked me that it got infected from the draw. If that can happen just from a bad blood draw I can only imagine what would happen if I was injecting something.

BODY: No. None of that. For sure. Just the blood draw scared me enough. Figure if I can't handle a blood draw, I can't handle injecting drugs ya know? It's just not for me. Although I imagine my hand swelling/whiteness and stuff was probably due more to sleeping on top of my hand and cutting off blood flow than anything to really do with the draw.

BODY: The whole premise is flawed it makes me so angry. TBH. Cutting people off from love and support if they don't go to treatment isn't going to make people change. In fact, it would probably drive a person deeper into addiction you always read the follow up stories at the end and it always says the person relapsed and hasn't been heard from since they dropped out of treatment.

BODY: Ya, that I understand but the premise of cutting your loved one out of your life simply because they "choose" addiction is very flawed. In fact, this idea that addiction is a choice and the way the the show plays that up is wrong. IDK I just dislike it''s message of "rehab or no contact" I get it that sometimes people need tough love but the show has a one size fits all kind of mentality and that's just not reality. Everyone is different.

It's put me in some crappy situations but I am lucky because at worst I'll end up fighting with my parents about "overspending." Which, I get is infuriating to some people.

BODY: Heya! I'm sorry I didn't get to this sooner! I got really busy with life but thank you /u/Bad_Mouth_BItchxx for tagging me on this. Here is what I advise, get yourself some kind of pill container that has 28-30days in it. Place your daily dosage in each slot and if you have to ask a family member or trusted friend to only give you your daily dose for the day in the morning or something of that sort.

I personally had my parents controlling my medications but that came to an end when they were starving me into Withdrawals before they'd give me my next dose. 

A timelock safe might help you a lot. Things like Live Fine 28 Day Pill Dispensers don't work because they're easy to beat but if you have the self control you can take out your daily dosage from a timelock safe and lock up the rest of your meds until it opens itself again the next day.

Also keeping a pain chart could be very helpful. Usually my pain charts look like this for example (it is a filled out chart to give you an idea): 



Time | Medication | Dosage | Pain Score | Notes | Alt Treatments
---|----|----|----|----|----
10:30am | Oxymorphone | 2.5mg | 5 | Upper right abdominal pain, seeing GP today. Also experiencing left leg numbness. Stressed out about traveling to see extended family 8 hrs away. Worried about the drive. | Using heating pads on abdomen.
1:25pm | Oxymorphone | 5mg | 7 | Long car ride is making me nauseated/car sick and my body aches from being in one position for so long. | Tried laying down in the back seat.


Then you can take this information to your DRs. Office and provide them with insights as to how the pain is being managed and what is helping and what is not helping. It will help your credibility and make you look like the responsible careful patient you are. Sometimes patients have to be proactive and this is a good way to do it.

BODY: Yep that's my goal! To make it a whole other month. This month staying out of the hospital came at the cost of having to request and early refill of my pain medications but I don't do that often and it was just by 4 days so my doctors office didn't give me a hard time. They just made sure to drug test me and confirmed that I had no hospital stays which I didn't so, I was good. I just need to stick to the medications better this month. That's all there is to it.

BODY: I'm so glad you found my ideas helpful. 
&gt; I clearly need to fix this now. I need to stop using my pain, which is sometimes debilitating, as a crutch. 

Yes, now is the time to fix this. Getting out of the habit of justifying your use is imperative especially since fixing it now is going to be a helluva lot easier than if you were to "fix it" in 6+ months. I personally find that setting aside 1-2 days a week to specially enjoy my medications keeps me sane. I scratch that desire to get high and then the rest of the week I manage the pain and it helps things along because I'm scratching that itch in a controlled/planned environment. 

Also don't be afraid to break pills into halves or even fourths to keep things going smoothly. I am personally scripted Opana 2x/daily at 10mgs IR. I usually snap 'em into 4ths and take 8 minidoses throughout the day every 3-5 hours depending. 

Sometimes I'll even take half at once but hardly ever a full pill. It just helps me keep my use in check while managing the pain.

You definitely can do this. It's not impossible. You got this. One day at a time, even one dose at a time,, you've got this!

Keep on rocking.

BODY: Oh god goddess. When I had my feeding tube, I'd get so fucking constipated that it'd put pressure on the tubing. My tube went to my jejunum (small bowel) and bypassed my stomach. On days where I couldn't handle the pressure, pain and just needed to go, my doctors recommended MagCit through the feeding tube. 

I'd literally push a bottle of MagCit directly to my small bowel and in 15 to 30 minutes, I'd be taking the shit of my life. I'd feel horrible until I actually would go. I'd also get very nauseated and could only do this in the hospital or with an IV in near a toliet, because if I didn't get IV nausea meds, I'd also vomit from it. 

Vomiting with the feeding tube was a big deal because I always ran the risk of getting the tube dislodged. In fact once I vomited (not with MagCit) and my feeding tube came up into my stomach, up into my throat and out through my mouth. I was litterally choking on this thing that was inside and out of me held in place by my abdomen. 

We had to call 911, but before they arrived I grabbed a leurlock syringe I had stolen from the hospital and deflated the balloon that held my tubing in place internally and ripped it out of my abdomen it went slidding back down my throat and back into my system to be pulled out near my bellybutton.

It was so gross and painful but adrenaline is helluva drug. Anyway, I digress.

TL;DR: when I had my feeding tube, I had to use MagCit in the hospital with IV nausea medications otherwise I risked vomiting my tubing up and causing major problems.

TITLE: I got accepted!, POST BODY: Heya Fam!

As you may know I've run into some turbulent times. My parents are wanting me to go to rehab, and my doctor is urging me to get my use under control because he will no longer write anymore early refills for me. I've required one for the past two months and he's basically told me to suck it up and stick to what he scripts me. Which, I have no problem with. As a result I have been on a taper and am finally comfy at 37.5mgs of oxycodone. I will however need to bring that down to 30mgs in the next 5 days. I think it's very realistic and doable.

While all of this has been going on we've been looking into everything from rehabs, dual diagnosis centers to pain clinics. The rehabs and dual diagnosis places denied me based on the severity of my medical condition. Those places felt they would not be able to help me. It was both devastating and relieving to hear that. 

Anyway, there was this one program that took me two months to hear back from, and lots of paperwork had to be sent it. I got a call the other day that they're gonna take on my case! I'm SO EXCITED. It's not a detox or a rehab at all. It's a pain clinic that's 8hrs away from me. 

My appointment is in 2moths from now. They're doing a full day evaluation session. I arrive at 8am to coordinate paperwork and get information together with the receptionist. Then at 8:30 I meet with the Pain Specialist/Doctor for 75 minutes. They do a full intake and evaluation of my situation. That is followed up b 75 minutes of physical therapy consult and session and finallly ends with a 90 minute session with the pain psychologist. 

After that I go to lunch for an hour and come back to meet with the entire team for 30-45minutes to discuss what they think and any recommendations they may have for me regarding my situation. 

My trip is going to be open ended because they could have me stay for their inpatient program where they adjust medications, monitor your mental health, and stabilize you if you need it. It's all personalized for me specially and I'm so excited that they think they can help me after reviewing my medical records.

I plan to be as honest as possible too. For instance, I will admit to overtaking my script and that I have a tendency to abuse my medications to avoid going to the emergency room when I probably should just go to the emergency room. I probably wont mention snorting my medication but like I said I'll talk about how I've been doubling it up and just struggling. I also plan to be honest about my diet and what I've found works for my GI System and what does not work for it. 

So yah. They already told me they wont write me any narcotic scripts the first visit, which I'm 100% okay with since I can't accept it anyway because of my local pain specialist. 

Anywhoozles, I'm excited about it and had to share!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/70rr4o/i_got_accepted/

...So far this is the first month in 7 months that I haven't had a 3+ day hospital stay. I'm really proud of myself for that. It's also the first month in 3 months I haven't required an early refill. I successfully tapered from 80mgs to 15mgs per day in ONE month. However, when I get my refill later this week I will jump back to 30mgs per day. I think that's sustainable now. I'm planning on asking my doctor for ninety 10mg oxys and then only take 20mgs per day and build a reserve stash for those days when the pay is outstanding/horrid. 

Also, in the last two weeks I've started seeing someone new. My life is finally picking up and I'm getting a little healthier. Oh and that pain clinic I've been wanting to get into? Yah, I got in, I go next month for a full day evaluation and am going to get a second opinion on my issues and how to manage my severe pancreatic pain problems.

I seriously am looking forward to it.

Then better than that in the last two weeks I started seeing someone new. We met on OkCupid which, I had joined as a *joke.* So, I was super suprised to like this guy as much as I do.

He's a cancer survivor so my new guy gets and understands the medical side of things. He's not on any opiates either and although we haven't been intimate, I've started referring to him as my boyfriend and likewise I'm his "girlfriend." 

You know how you meet that SO and you just "know" it's the one? Yah, that's how I feel. I've never felt that before. This is so new to me, I'm doing everything in my power not to fuck this up.

TITLE: My Past Emailed Me Today, POST BODY: As many of you may know, I have survived some extreme tragedies. Including the loss of my younger brother. Every year for the last 5 years I've made a post here about him on both his birthday and his passing. 


#Today is his birthday. He'd be 27 today. He died when he was 20 of a heroin overdose. If his story can help just one person think twice about his or her addiction then, his death wasn't in vain.


Most importantly, I think his death has saved my life. I rather go through withdrawals than cross the bridge to heroin. A few days ago this was put to the test and I opted for withdrawals. 


Apparently two years ago I set up an auto-email for myself for today. Not because I thought I'd forget today, but because I needed to remind myself that it's all OKAY. I got the year wrong in this auto email. It was supposed to send last year, but it sent this year. I was really surprised to get it today. Here is what it read:

&gt;Dear FutureMe,

&gt;Right now its the middle of June. In 4 months you will be celebrating [BROTHER]'s 26th birthday. Even though he's not around anymore remember the good times and don't forget to take care of yourself because you are loved.

&gt;Xo,

&gt;You.


It's his 27th birthday today, not 26th and I still miss him immensely. Today is a very complicated day for me. I'm not sure how to feel today. Roughly 3 weeks ago I started seeing someone new. Today is my new boyfriend's birthday. I don't know to feel about it exactly. Today is weird. 

Anyway, I love you all thanks for being there for me!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/78ht7r/my_past_emailed_me_today/

TITLE: The UnHappy, Grumpy and Irritating 29th Birthday with a Silver Lining., POST BODY: 2 days ago (October 29th) I had my golden Birthday. That's when you turn the age of the day of your birthday. For those that don't know this. For me that meant I was 29 on October 29th. 

I could not have been more miserable and angry with myself for being miserable about it.

My new man had booked us a cabin the woods as a birthday gift to me. We have only been together a month. ANyway, in an effort to NOT be dope sick on my birthday or in the cabin, I went through withdrawals a week and a half ago. 

I had it counted perfectly.gave mom enough pills to last me for my trip and told her no to give them to me till X day. I stuck to it and was really proud of myself for sticking to it. 

So we get to the cabin and I'm counting out what I have when my brain decides that October 29th doesn't to exist. So I count out for October 27th, 28th, &amp; 30th. I was supposed to be out in the early morning on the 30th since that was the day we were headed home into town. 

So, I wake p on the 29th (my birthday) go to take my morning dose and realize my horrible, horrible, horrible mistake. 

#Happy fucking birthday to me.

To top things off I also had a cold somehow and came to the "sad" realization that I'm almost 30 in a body that could easily be at least twice my age. I felt so bad for my man too, because I was really sour. He took it in strides like a champ though and did a few things to help me feel better, bath, sex, walks, food, comfort meds from CVS, that sorta thing. 

We even debated going to the hospital but I insisted on not doing that because I know how useless they are. Even though I was having a bit of projectile vomiting (so I'm not all convinced it was purely withdrawals) I did eat quite a bit of junk food out there so that my have been contributing.

I made the best of it all though. At least as best as I could and then when we got home on the 30th my hematologist was gracious enough to squeeze me into an appointment so I could get a set of IV pain meds, IV nausea meds, IV stomach meds, and IV fluids. I should be square for the next 12-24hrs now. 

Anyway, ya, I wasn't expecting that at all. I hope everyone is having a happier Halloween than I did birthday., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/79y2xm/the_unhappy_grumpy_and_irritating_29th_birthday/

TITLE: *fingerscrossed*, POST BODY: How is everyone? Like seriously, I wanna know. I've been very MIA and I miss you all.

Personally,

I'm on the countdown to my 2nd opinion appointment. For the first time in a few years, I'll be getting another opinion on what to do about the situation I am in. 

For those that don't know, I have a rare pancreatic condition. For the past 8.5 months, I've averaged a 5day hospital on a monthly basis for 7 months. 

We're currently almost on month 2 without a hospital visit and that's a big fucking deal. I think part of it is that I've started giving a shit again and am just coping better :-). Don't get me wrong it's hard as fuck &amp; suicide has been on the brain a bit more realistically lately, but, hell if I'm gonna kill myself I might as well at least try first so, I've been doing that. Somehow the logic is twisted but it's working for me.

TITLE: Clean? ...Wait ...WUT!?, POST BODY: Today I had my appointment at the specialist's clinic that was a day's drive away from me. I got a second opinion on my pain issues. 

After spending 8am - 2pm there I walked away from it knowing that I definitely have serious pain issues and that the opiates are putting me into a vicious cycle of pain, withdrawal, and feeling "okayish" 

I am on 30-45mgs of oxycodone per day right now. 

It doesn't make sense to up the dosage, it doesn't make sense to be on this for life and it doesn't make sense to keep going through the ups &amp; downs of withdrawal. Especially because I'm currently experiencing withdrawals *nightly* around 3 in the morning. I can't handle to constant yo-yo*ing* of my medical problems and upset with hospital visits etc.

The next step in all of this is that I'm going to see an addictionologist. 

Then I will go on suboxone patches (butrans patch) for pain purposes at a low dose. It'll all be done, inpatient. Mainly because I had a problem with suboxone film strips that you take orally. I had a seizure on that. 

If it's successful and I can tolerate the butrans patch (goes on skin) then I can handle the pain better and pick up my life and once I gain stability on the patch, I can begin to get off these narcotic type medications entirely. 

It scares me though because my pain problems are severe. I just don't know anymore. I'm really on the fence about this decision. 

This isn't some Malibu recovery center that charges you $50,000 upfront since insurance won't cover it either, it's a hospital program that my insurance will cover and that has a real shot at weening me down and directing me correctly. 

The fact that it's a hospitalized medical thing makes me feel a bit more comfortable, but I am completely unsure of everything. I may want to stay with what I know and what is predictable which is creating a lot of turmoil in my life or I can go, get serious, take this route and hope for the best.

TITLE: The "Final" High, POST BODY: So, I may be starting Butrans patches. I have my worries, but I think I'm going to do it regardless and give getting stability back in my life a try. So, with that, I've started to think about potentially doing the last high. 

I feel like if I do abuse my pain medication for that final high I'll be setting myself up to fail. Or somehow aren't truly ready to make the swap off the pills.

Alternatively, if I don't abuse it then I'm setting myself up for success.

OR perhaps it'd be better to have that final high and get it out of my system so I'm not thinking about it during the butrans patch period of time. However, I think I'll always romanticize the quick fast-acting narcotic pain relief that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside while conquering pain problems ... seriously, when I drop from an 8 of pain on the pain scale to a 3 it is better than a fucking orgasm.

I dunno. Feel free to chime into the conversation., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7c5ip7/the_final_high/

TITLE: My Specialist Appointment/Second Opinion, POST BODY: Heya Bropiates. After meeting with the 2nd opinion pain management appoint last week I flew over 400 miles a week later on short notice to be seen by the addiction specialist.

The specialist wanted me to start a Buprenorphine patch which I am 100% willing to do and want to do despite the potential for a seizure. 

I had a seizure once when I tried a 2mg/0.5mg suboxone film. They think the 0.5mg naloxone in the Buprenorphine and the high dose of Buprenorphine caused me to have a seizure along with the potential of other drugs in my system.

They think microgram dosing of the Buprenorphine in a patch would be perfect for me. At first I was nervous about doing this but after meeting with the addiction specialist she recommended a few things:

1. USE THE PATCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY CURRENT 30MG NARCOTIC DOSE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES EXCEPT ADDING THE LOW DOES PATCH.
2. DO IT ALL INPATIENT IN THE EVENT OF A POTENTIAL SEIZURE
3. EVENTUALLY WEEN OFF THE NARCOTIC AND JUST BE ON THE BUPRENORPHINE PATCH
4. GET OFF EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BUPRENORPHINE WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR EVERYTHING ABOUT 1.5-2.5 YEARS FROM NOW. 

I do eventually want to be off the drugs, but it's hard you know.

I was so surprised she recommended to keep me on the narcotic, 30mgs of oxycodone. She said if I do it that way I'll most likely eliminate problems with breaking through the suboxone on my receptors for the pain problems. 

Then when I have pain flares if I could use an at home script I'd be able to stay out of the hospital and have 24/7 pain relief instead of this yo-yo*ing* effect and nightly withdrawals I've been dealing with. 

The specialist seemed to think staying on the microgram dosing wouldn't block the opiate the way it does in 2mg+ doses. It'd be like a 20mcg dose so it'd be easier/simplier to breakthrough the pain 

She alaso said later on down the line once I get stability I could switch to just the patch alone and then from there potentially come off of the patch entirely.

***I'm really happy about this.***

Unfortunately, my parents aren't on board and accused me of lying to the doctor about things, when I was brutally honest. I don't think I've ever been this honest with doctors before and this was her professional opinion. 

I'm upset with my family they keep calling me a street junkie and belittle me over my use of drugs in the first place and they say a lot of deeming things, but it's rough because I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm  just trying to do the right thing for my pain and it just seems like my parents are unsupportive and it's really upsetting me quite a bit.

Support would be warmly welcomed! Here's to hoping things go well and I do better now., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7dxbmm/my_specialist_appointmentsecond_opinion/

TITLE: I'm 22 hours into withdrawal, POST BODY: I'm 22hrs into withdrawals. Cold turkey so to speak. I have a tiny amount of xanax and some lyrica. Today, im going to call my psychiatrist and see if he'll script me enough clonidine/bezo/maybe seraquil? To fight the rest of the withdrawal. If not I'll call my pain specialist and beg for a squeeze me in appointmrntt today. If that doesn't work i can alwaus call my hematologist office who has been a godsend to me over the years. 

I'm doing this all at my boyfriend's place. My parents are out of town. When they get back I'll be 5 days sober. I'll have done it. 

As for the pain? I'll see how bad it REALLY is over the next few months. Maybe alternative measures can help more than I previously thought.

TITLE: Day 3.5/4 - Of Withdrawal - The Worst is Over? [UPDATE], POST BODY: I'm through the worst of it all withdrawal wise. I stopped taking or took my last dose of Oxycodone Saturday night. I got by on Lyrica and an old Xanax script. Right after the weekend, my psychiatrist scripted me clonidine and liberum. I decreased the Lyrica and D/C'd the Xanax mainly because I ran out. Anyway, I hopped off oxycodone at a 25mg a day dose. Nothing huge but I had been previously taking 60-80mgs of it but about 4 days before the jump off I tapered it to 25mgs at the lowest.

I'm also fighting a UTI/Kidney Infection. I was forced to go to the ER this week for it. I declined pain medication and was given IV Antibiotics along with a script for antibiotics.

I'm slowly becoming hypersensitive to my body. I can feel everything and it's weird as fuck.I'm just chugging along now though., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7gfbvo/day_354_of_withdrawal_the_worst_is_over_update/

TITLE: Dori (me) Is Approaching a Week Clean as of TOMORROW!, POST BODY: Oh, my goodness guys. This hasn't been easy. Look what you made me do. *(bonus points if you catch the cheesy reference)* 

I originally joined r/opiates roughly 5 years ago. Mainly to gain insight into my brother's Heroin addiction and death. As I gained that insight I was ultimately getting sick myself. It took a year to diagnose me with a rare condition that has led to chronic pancreatitis and what I still expect is a lifetime of pain.

For 4-5 years I've been on and off the opioids and for the last 3 years I've been on them nonstop. 

During my opiate career I've had two boyfriends both non-users. The first would berate me over my addiction and pain problems but was a complete alcoholic. Double standards much? I think so. 

The 2nd boyfriend came within the last four months. He's been very sweet and we've been talking a lot about my health especially since I was starting to consider a need to get off the opiates even a few months before we met. 

However, as time with him went on and I got to a point where things were do or die for me, myself, I &amp; my future with this new guy. ^(you know how you know it's the one? That's how I feel about this guy) 

So, when I ran out of my script 5 days early and had no money to supplement it, I made a difficult decision. I jumped off the medication cold turkey.

I was on an average of 70mgs of the stuff before I went something like this:

* Day 1: 50mgs
* Day 2: 40mgs
* Day 3: 35mgs
* Day 4: 25mgs
* Day 5: 0mgs

I consumed my last dose at 7pm on November 25th, 2017. Ironically, if we turned the clock back 7 years my brother would be alive for another 5 days before he'd die of his Heroin OD. I would be clean &amp; sober the day of his death for the first time in 5 years. It's kinda spooky to me and means something. I don't know I've always believed in dates and time and things like that, that everything is connected for a reason and sometimes ***what you think is bad isn't always the worst thing. Sometimes it's even good***.

With that said I've been battling a Kidney Infection plus my period on top of the withdrawal so needless to say it's been intense. Since quitting some big things I've done are as follows:

1. Declined Narcotics at my Drs. Office
2. Flushed a 10mg Oxycodone Tablet Down the Toliet
3. Declined my usual refill &amp; declined a muscle relaxant as well
4. informed all my Doctors of the change

I am becoming a new person. Entirely. They say every 7 years your cells regenerate to make you new again and 7 years past my brother's death, I am finally new again., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7h09r4/dori_me_is_approaching_a_week_clean_as_of_tomorrow/

My parents are going fucking *lalalallalalalalalalaa*, I won't leave them. I can't handle that. We still have electricity and everything, but there's a fire that is 10 min east of me. 

According to a friend on the fire department, all it takes is one good gust and 1,000 arches goes up in flames. I have a few of your phone numbers, I'm writing a list of important numbers down on paper, if people don't hear from me, **10-days off the opiates and I'm dead.** I will provide my real life name to a few of you. This is fucking scary.

Needless to say I'm scared, but hopefully, my father can get us the fuck out once police start rolling down our streets and the loud phones blare.

PS: I'm charging TWO external batteries to keep phone battery going. while I can. So, I'll be in touch best I can. 

UPDATE: The MANDATORY EVACUATION ZONE IS 5 MILES FROM ME. I EXPECT TO BE IN THAT ZONE BY NOON. I WILL NOT, WILL NOT, WILL NOT LEAVE MY PARENTS. I JUST WON'T.

UPDATE #2: I'm monitoring the situation closely, I'm personally packed and ready &amp; so is the dog, right now I'm just hanging out trying to calm myself down. I put a bell on my pup along with his collar so if he hides I can find him. 

Might just throw the leash on him as a precautionary but I don't want him excited thinking he's going somewhere, he's already all kinds of nervous because I am. 

I have 2 suitcases &amp; 4 small bags packed up and ordered by importance. If anything I can throw some of the small bags into the larger suitcase and downsize it but right now yah.

UPDATE #3: I PERSONALLY HAVE EVACUATED DOG AND MEDS IN HAND. MOMS PREPPING THE HOUSE IF THERES AN EVACUATION ORDER AND WILL LEAVE. THE SMOKE WAS WAY TOO HEAVY FOR ME AND I ALREADY HAVE A RESPITORY INFECTION.

**final update for Wednesday**: I am completely safe sound my parents have refused to leave. If the fire spreads overnight I will know about it I have friends on watch for me on the East Coast that will call me if conditions change. 

In the meantime i see my doctor for my respitory infection tomorrow morning. The smoke hasnt helped., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7hypdu/i_might_die_in_a_fire_today/

TITLE: 30 Days Sober TODAY! MERRY CHRISTMAS!, POST BODY: Hey /r/opiates!!!

Its been exactly 30days sober for me. For those who do not know ... I have major chronic pain problems including chronic pancreatitis, a metal plate in my neck, and fibromyalgia.

I accidentally got off the opiates exactly 30 days ago when I ran out of my script and money on a weekend. It started with a make it till Monday attitude and snowballed from there into today where I am 30 days now. 

I went through 10 days of withdrawals after coming off a 60mg average daily habit of oxycodone. Although I could easily tolerate 120mgs in a day if I wanted to. 

I currently live in a daily 4-7 pain score but i rather do that now than ever go through 10 full days of withdrawal symptoms. Maybe because its fresh in my mind but I hope to never forget how awful those 10 days were.

Love,

We met online, we've never met in person. For two years we've exchanged so many phone calls and texts that we know all of each other's secrets. I call you kid even though you're just a few years younger than me and your like surrogate little bro to me know. I love you so g'dmd much.

Anyway, today, you turned yourself into police for an outstanding warrant you had. I know you're going to suffer some really hardcore withdrawals, and it's going to fucking suck ass. Guess what though? I'll be writing you soon. I'll send you mail, might even throw some money on your commissary.

It's scary going to jail. It's TERRIFYING to withdraw in jail. I hope all goes well for you. I hope you get out sooner than later, but we don't know. &amp; for the record, I don't think you're an awful person. I think drugs just fuck us all up. 

Even me, they even fucked me up too. I'm hoping for nothing but the best for you.

Even though you can't see this I want to send you warm hugs, well wishes, and lotsa love.  What you did today was super ballsy. 

With the most platonic love ever, kiddo, Stay SAFE.

xo,

Dori

To the rest of you all, any tips on what kinda things you like to get in jail/prison do they let you mail photos? Is it better to just put money on the books for someone or get them a specific care package and if I wanna call them would I have to get a collect call that would show up on my phone bill? Just a buncha questions from someone who hasn't connected to someone incarcerated before., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/84kejv/dear_kiddo/

TITLE: I'm stressed out. Losing my Pain Doctor &amp; Been Slipping on my Script., POST BODY: My pain specialist will no longer be my doctor as of June. He's taking on workers compensation patients only from then on out. To say I'm very stressed out by this is an understatement. I have a list of new doctors to call to transfer the prescription to someone new, but then I've noticed myself slipping on my current script yet again. I don't know if my pain is being inadequately managed or if I'm just a fiend or probably both. But, what can I do? 

I'm at this point seriously considering going on methadone permanently, but I'm super scared to do that. The last time I was on that my doctor decided it wasn't working, pulled me off it and I became near suicidal and my bones hurt so badly for months afterward.

I'm starting to get really scared about things., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/858idw/im_stressed_out_losing_my_pain_doctor_been/

TITLE: I got lucky by being honest about my medication usage., POST BODY: My pain specialist is getting out of the pain management business. Which means, I now no longer have a pain doctor. This was super fusterating and with just a month to find one I freaked out a bit. I finally was able to snag an appointment for the 2nd of April with someone so hopefully, that goes well.

Simultaneously I started to flare super badly. Vomiting violently multiple times and having bad bowel movements. I couldn't handle it. I went down to the ER and ended up being admitted because my labs were all over the place. Since my pain specialist is no longer my doctor I got assigned to the regular in-house pain team here at the hospital.

I realized I was essentially abusing and go through my script way fast taking closer to 30mgs of oxycodone versus the perscribed 10mgs. Bad. I know, but I was really trying to avoid being in the hospital and I ended up here anyway.

Well, as you can imagine I was very nervous to talk to the in-house pain team about this. i explained to the doctor, "I was perscribed 10mgs but was really needing 30mgs in a day and now I'm flaring and its hard to keep it under control" to my surprise he organized my pain meds to match what I was used to versus what I was prescribed and has promised to send me home with a comparable script. He also recommended I do a ketamine infusion. Which, I am now scheduled to do tomorrow. I'm super nervous about it, but hopefully, all goes well.

On top of that, I should be getting some good recommendations for pain specialists. So, that's a bonus/plus too., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/87m6i8/i_got_lucky_by_being_honest_about_my_medication/

TITLE: My new pain doctor concerns me, but he's my only choice right now..., POST BODY: Hiya Fam. How are you doing? My life has been pretty insane. After a 2 week hospitalization that included 3 low-dose ketamine treatments I was discharged off of 0.5mgs of dialudid IV every 4hrs and 15mgs of oxycodone every 4hrs to an ultra small script of 30 5mg Oxycodone pills. My previous pain doctor wouldn’t see me because he’s getting out of the pain management business (to no fault of my own) and I hit withdrawals last week Friday prompting an emergency visit with a very expensive pain specialist. He gave me a two week supply of medication and told me to come back in 2 weeks and spend more money.

So, I followed up with an additional specialist covered by my insurance today and I don’t know how to feel about it. He immediately suggested I install a pain pump/spinal cord stimulator thing to which I politely declined. I've been through enough traumatic surgical procedures and want to hold off on this option for as long as possible.

Then he tried to put me on belbuca selling it to me as “for pain” and “not buprenorphine” he also gave me false information about how you could seamlessly transition from taking oxycodone to taking that without being in withdrawals first. 

I had to drive home the point that I had a seizure on buprenorphine in the past and was unwilling to take that without being under supervision first. To which he finally just increased my Lyrica dosage and switched me from oxycodone 10mg 3x/day to Dilaudid 2mg 3x/day saying it didn’t have the same reputation as oxycodone and not to drink with it.

I think I’m going to have to stay with this doctor though. He’s crap but he at least prescribed me something useful and he doesn’t cost $250 a visit wanting to see me every two weeks. He’s covered. 

I don’t know. Shitpost. At least I got something even if it is a 50% overall equivalency decrease. They give me the Dialudid in the hospital and it works well. So yah., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8b40u3/my_new_pain_doctor_concerns_me_but_hes_my_only/

TITLE: Ever been in so much pain you just wished you were dead?, POST BODY: That's how I feel tonight.

I waited 4 hours in the ER waiting room followed by 1hour in the back in the worst pain I've had in a long time now. I had vomited  roughly 6 times in a 3 hour period and was beyond shaky/ill. Quite frankly I'm still ill. 

Finally, I'm seen by an ER doctor who says he needs to talk to my new pain management specialist before he'll administer any pain medication. An hour goes by and I've left two voicemails myself for this specialist and haven't heard back another hour goes by still nothing I leave another voicemail. Then 30 minutes go by and the ER doctor comes in to tell me that my pain specialist is denying me access to care in the ER. I sob quietly and squirm. I'm in the worst pain of my life and things have just gotten worse because I can't get any relief. I leave another 2 voicemails for my doctor - still no reponse.

So, I call and try to get through to one of his associates who is quite rude to me. I explain the situation and he was like "what do you want me to do about it? You're already at the ER." I ask him to clarify my contract for me, afterall, there in the same clinic and he flat out tells me he wont do that and was very condescending.

I cry. 

I ask to be discharged. They take over an hour getting me discharged. I cry more. I get home, sleep for 45 minutes and now I'm up in tears and pain and oh so angry. 

I didnt ask for this. I didn't ask to get sick. I didn't ask to require aroud the clock pain medication. I didn't ask to go to the ER. I don't abuse my situation - at least I haven't in over 8 months. Right now I just want to die it's so bad.  IDK how I'm gonna make it till 8am to show up at his office early and get some answers, but I'm gonna have to. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't. I can't die because I have family and a boyfriend. I can't do that to them, but goddamnit I'd be lying if I didn't say I genuinely don't feel lke living anymore., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8f9ze6/ever_been_in_so_much_pain_you_just_wished_you/

Turns out the ER doctor straight up lied to me. I went to see my pain specialist yesterday morning and he said he never denied me access to care in the ER. He said he received an angry call from the ER doctor telling him he shouldn't be prescribing me anything and that I was in there faking my illness. 

So apparently the whole, "you're under pain management and your new contract for all his patient's states emergency care is off the table" rant by the ER doctor was an entire lie.

Someone who had seen me for less than 5 minutes made the determination I was lying and then called my regular doctors to tell them I was in there lying. Apparently, according to my pain specialist, he doesn't recommend I ever go back to that hospital again because the note is so severe he doesn't think I'll ever get adequate treatment again. 

I've been treated at this hospital for almost 10 years now. 

I'm slowly becoming increasingly suicidal. IDK what to do. At all., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8fklr1/update_ever_been_in_so_much_pain_you_wish_you/

TITLE: I'm Contemplating Getting Clean Again..., POST BODY: So, back in November, I got clean. It lasted 90 days, just short of 100 before I had a pancreatic flare and ended up hospitalized again. They administered pain medication and my doctor put me back on a regular script. Then, my damned doctor decided he was getting out of the pain management business so 2 weeks after being put back on a steady script I had to find a new doctor. That was a pain in the ass and made me so mad that I was even back on these medications.

Since then, I've fallen quite hard back into old addiction-like habits and just wish I could manage my life without narcotics. I really don't see myself on these things forever and having an addiction is SO EXPENSIVE. 

So, here's my thought - I need to get clean. I just do. 

Except I'm so nervous for what withdrawals will do to me yet again. It's such a hard process to go through and can be a bit expensive if you use a medical detox facility. 

I'm thinking of cutting costs by seeing my hematologist/cancer specialist. I don't have cancer, he sees me for anemia issues, but his office offers IV hydration and any medication you might need from IV pain meds to chemotherapy. Each visit costs me $150 though, but seeing him 5 times from Monday - Friday is a lot cheaper than going to a medical detox facility.

I already have clonidine at home from last time, and all I would need is a script for something like Valium and possibly a muscle relaxant.

I don't know. I'm just typing out thoughts. Can anyone else add in anything that might be useful. I just want to be 100% sure about this because I don't exactly want to fail AGAIN., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8k3htb/im_contemplating_getting_clean_again/

TITLE: I was ready to die..., POST BODY: I don't know what went wrong. I don't know why I can't cope, just that I can't anymore. I ran out of medication 2 weeks early and let my pain specialist a voicemail. Frantically tried to reach him for day and no response. Decided to just go through with the withdrawal cold-turkey and but even stopped by his office on Friday to see if he was there to at least leat help me through this but, "no he just left for the day" is the answer I got.

So I go downstairs to call a lyft and get home. lyft shows up and the driver asks how I am, I give him a way to honest answer: "Not fucking great, I just want to get home" he goes, "I don't take negativity in my car get the fuck out." I'm like "WTF" but  throw my bag out he passenger window and he aggressively gests out-out of the car to drag me out IDK I check the car to make sure my stuff is out my cell phone falls to the ground he stomps on it, we start yelling and getting into it when I blow.

I dart and run across 6 lanes of active busy rush hour traffic yelling and hoping someone hit me. somehow, I get all the way across and my stuff is still on the other side so I figure  I'd go play in traffic again and I run across 6 lanes again and somehow make it safely across. 

I hear sirens. I figure they're for me so I book it up to my other doctor's office (not pain management) who I figure will give me a hand and advise me he does. I end up going to a psychiatric based hospital that doesn't admit me for psych reasons because they feel my actions are very pain driven. 

So here I am now feeling depressed as fuck and hospitalized for medical reasons not knowing what to do or think., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8mu98y/i_was_ready_to_die/

I cannot physically cope anymore with my illness and coexisting drug addiction. 

I am going to go to one hospital tonight and then if they discharge me from the ER there, I'm going to another one. Basically hospital shopping to get off the drugs because I cannot stand it anymore.

In other news, life keeps beating me up. I got an online gig and missed the submission deadline by 3 hours a timezone change issue and they fired me then and there. So the moment I get something promising I get kicked down.

TITLE: Owe. That Hurt., POST BODY: [Original Post
](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8q6byk/im_checking_into_the_hospital_tonight/)

I went to one hospital which referred me to another. I was completely suicidal and verbalized this to both hospitals. The first one gave me a package of resources to call for the withdrawal/suicidality, and the second one told me they thought  I was lying about suicide and since I had, had an evaluation 10 days before (where they really should've hospitalized me) that I wasn't eligible for a new psych evaluation.

I was beyond devastated and nearly got hit by a car over it because I flung myself into traffic hoping to get hit. The police were called and they tried to reason with the ER but again all the ER did was print out paperwork for me to call myself and wouldn't call psych. Even with police involvement. I kept saying I just need help and they kept saying that I didn't meet the criteria for suicide and that they would not give me opiates. I repeated that I just wanted to withdraw safely with my suicidality and chronic illness it wasn't safe to do it outpatient. 

Some 25-year-old doctor whose ego was way bigger than his reasoning skills just said no and referred me to another ER.

I got home slept 4hours and then decided to go see a doctor I trust - my hematologist - he helped me with IV meds for that day and right after my appointment with him went to the 3rd hospital. The ER there was great. They helped the withdrawal immensely with clonidine, 1mg Ativan 50mg Benadryl 4mg Zofran, 30mg Toradol, and so forth that I slept like a baby for a little bit.

They decided to hospitalize me on the psych unit there 72-hour hold. They didn't allow IVs on this unit and I might as well have been going cold turkey because I kept vomiting up the oral medication they gave me. I got very little out of that hospitalization. about 60 hours in they broke the hold early &amp; I revisited their ER just to stabilize my situation.

Now here I am 

4days and 5 hours since I last used. I'm out of the woods withdrawal wise, but now everyone wants me to go to a 30day rehab. I'm very much so against that. I'll do an IOP but not inpatient/residential and I think it'll work for me because they'll be able to work around any work schedule I may have. I think it'll work out well. IOPs are typically covered insurance wise whereas 30-day stays are not and half the reason I want to so many ER places is that we were trying to do it covered by my insurance all the detox places would've cost us $2,000 and up.

Anyway, I'm off the drugs again (YAY!) but I'm in incredible amounts of pain. I'm hoping that subsides soon.

**Edit: I realize running into traffic was a bad idea. I really could have endangered someone else and i own it that that was wrong. If i could apologize to those drivers I would.  I was in a very fucked up state of mind. Anyway I'm currently checking into an outpatient treatment center.  They do not feel inpatient is right for me especially since I'm already detoxed. Right now I'm just going to put the pieces back together, own and accept my mistakes and move forward.**, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8r9sxq/owe_that_hurt/

Addressing Running into Traffic from Post 2
====

**I realize running into traffic was a bad idea. I really could have endangered someone else and I own it that that was wrong. If I could apologize to those drivers I would. I was in a very fucked up state of mind. Anyway, I'm currently checking into an outpatient treatment center. They do not feel inpatient is right for me especially since I'm already detoxed. Right now I'm just going to put the pieces back together, own and accept my mistakes and move forward.**

I know I'm Disliked Here
===

Despite being disliked by some here, I feel sharing my story is not only cathartic or important for myself but, it if it at least helps one other person going through the same sort of shit, then good. I'm glad I shared. We've all done fucked up things with our addictions, and now it's about restoring the damage done and moving forward. I just hate how quick some of you are to judge when you're not going through it. Just like I can't judge you based on a few paragraphs or stories - you can't judge me because of what I have to on a opiates related forum. I don't sit and judge anyone here. I find mutual respect is the best medicine. **I kindly ask that any critiques given are constructive and not downright mean.** I'm really trying to improve here and am taking the first steps towards that.

5 Days Sober, Let's Restart
===

Just working on my life now. I have several job potentials in my email plus I'm meeting with a counselor Monday. They require 3 recovery meetings a week along with 9 hours worth of recovery group work weekly. We'll see if this program is a fit for me. It's covered by my insurance - their inpatient is not. Either way, I'm just picking up the pieces and starting over. The recovery AA/NA or SMART meetings are way outside of my comfort zone. They're just emotionally triggering so I have a friend that's willing to take me to my first meeting hopefully it goes well, we'll see. 

The Pain is Real
===

I have a real pain problem. Even the counselor today asked if I was still in withdrawal or pain. The pain is localized so I'm pretty sure it's actual pain vs. withdrawal. Especially because my UA came up negative for opioids. I do have a residual cold now though because of the exhaustion and lowered immune system from the withdrawal but that's not a biggie. What's going to be trick is finding something that works for the pain that isn't opiate based. I think right now it's all about keeping clear and developing better coping mechanisms for my situation. I'm not sure what that looks like right now but at least I'm taking steps towards it., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8rfqcu/hopefully_not_hopeless/

TITLE: I'm not sure what to do..., POST BODY: Right now I'm doing three things:

1. Attending NA/AA
2. Seeking IOP
3. Finding a Job/Be Employed

So, here's my problem. I likely can only do 2 of the three. Or I'm going to run myself ragged. I'm thinking I should do IOP and get employment, but I do like the fellowship of NA/AA. So I'm not 100% sure. 

For now it NA/AA &amp; IOP until I get a job then it'll likely be IOP &amp; Employment but I'm also considering not doing IOP at all. IOP may not benefit me because I have a strong CBT/DBT/Mindfulness/etc. foundation. I want to see what this program has to offer though so I will attend to start and maybe decide from there. IDK. I'm feeling conflicted about how many recovery choices I have.

I am looking for a new doctor to work with on non-narcotic options. It's super rough because I have chronic pancreatitis from a rare genetic abnormality. Plus I have a metal plate in covering 3 levels.

I do need to think of an Emergency visit care plan for when my pancreas flares and I get really sick. Or if something more were to happen with my neck.

I do know I rather no one ever give me a take home supply of narcotic medications ever again.

This fucking treatment center (IOP) wants me to start tomorrow and likely will not allow me to leave to go see my boyfriend for the 4th of July. Monday - Thursday. Fucking hell.

TITLE: Relapse or Not?, POST BODY: I started to vomit again last night. It was awful. The pain was intense. So, I called up my friend who has emergency medications including tramadol &amp; weed. I went with the full intention of taking the tramadol but when I arrived her and I discussed things deeply. I then vomited, yet again, at her place and she offered that instead of doing the tramadol I should use some of her weed. After a bit back and forth I ended up leaving the tramadol and smoking the weed.

So my question is:

Do I need to start from day 1 again? I feel like that would do more harm than good. Kinda encourage my F*CK it attitude ...  ya know?, PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/8z24cr/relapse_or_not/

TITLE: IOP is a Trigger., POST BODY: Eugh. I hate admitting this but I think I need to stop going to my IOP. My insurance only approved 15 days worth of it and I'm on day 10. Of course they want to petition me to stay longer but, I'm thinking of walking out on the program. 

For some reason in IOP I'm having a fuckton of trouble relating to people there and then we have these assignments that ask very irrelevant questions that I'm struggling to answer. 

I spoke with my sponsor from NA about how I'm feeling in IOP and she advised me to speak to the IOP counselor. I spoke with her and at first, she thought I was triggered by NA meeting and told me to stop attending them if it was making me anxious/wanting to use. Upon explaining the meetings were fine it was the IOP that was the most trouble she told me to just keep showing up.

She then proceeded to tell me I needed to stop relating my addiction to my pain problems, but pain is my biggest trigger next to IOP. So, dunno how useful it would be to not mention it. She then told me to talk to my sponsor and I told her I had already done so and she told me to talk to my counselor. All I got was an "o" response. 

So now I've got no ideas on how to approach this problem.

While there are similarities between my stories and the people in the program, I agree when it when it comes to opiates, I am addicted. However, there is this argument that if I smoke weed or need a dosage in the hospital or drink alcohol I'll go right back to opioid use. 

There's no denying I have addiction problems and am an addict. I also believe I'm an exceptionally unique case. Firstly, my addiction struck in the last 2 years in my late 20s due to When I did drink from age 10 -22 I was fine with it. I'd just have one almost everytime. I have 2 instances in my life where I binge drank. Then, with marijuana, I've smoke 10 times in my entire life and each and every time I did so it NEVER triggered a need or desire to take pain pills. In fact, it was the opposite, I'd forget my pain pills. 

Almost all of my doctors have been encouraging me to use MJ for a variety of reasons ranging from anxiety to pain relief. The more I go to IOP the more I am realizing it's not an addiction that's my problem, it's ***pain***. IDK I'm having trouble relating to the others at IOP and I really think the program isn't for me.

TITLE: I am Scared., POST BODY: People say addiction is a choice. Well, I didn't choose to get so physically ill that I vomit all the time. I didn't choose to get a rare genetic disorder that is painful by nature. I didn't choose to get so physically dependent on pills that stopping was a nightmarish hell I wouldn't wish upon anyone.

The thing is when I quit using it isn't just uncomfortable for 3-7 days. It sends me into an acute suicidal mindset that cannot be tamed. More than that though, it leads me straight into a realization that I am indeed in more physical pain than I could ever handle or cope with. 

I relapsed this past Thursday on pills and then last night I fell hard. I fell into the hands of Heroin. It was my first time ever. I just couldn't keep up with the pain. At all. I describe what I go through on a daily basis as cruel and unusual punishment for being chronically ill. 

There's no excuse for trying the Heroin. I had many opportunities to refuse it, and yet i did not. I threw away 45 days worth of sobriety for relief. Relief from these past 45 days where I have been in more pain than I can manage on my own.

TITLE: "A Burning Desire" - Because I was too nervous to share today., POST BODY: So I relapsed about 30+ days ago and haven't really been to many AA/NA meetings because I had a bunch of health complications (not opioid related) to deal with and a hospitalization for my pancreas plus I put a hairline fracture in my foot so that was fun too.

I finally got to a meeting today. It's one I go to regularly and when they did the chips one girl hesitated and then got up to collect hers and while that was happening my sponsor jabbed me and as all "you too."  Damn Her (with love). I have 27 days since my relapse. So I bit the bullet i was trying so hard to avoid and took that newcomers chip. Then someone I know who was sitting to the left of me gave me a little hug when I sat down. That felt kinda good.

After that though I really felt I needed to share but couldn't bring myself to speak up. I was already nerve wrecked from collecting the chip as it was. It was interesting because one girl and I once collected 30 day chips on the same day at the same meeting and she was 70 or so days clean today and I'm back at 27 days. I felt a bit jealous but it calmed down quick when I reminded myself that our journey's are different and that that's perfectly A-OKAY! I was also slightly impressed that I managed to think that all up in less than 5-minutes without any additional input from others. That, that came from inside of me. That was cool.

Anyway...

Ya, I'm Dori, I'm An Addict, And I'm Fucking 27 Days Clean.

TITLE: Spinal Surgery Update &amp; A Resentment..., POST BODY: As you may know I’m facing spinal surgery.

Here are the juicy updates:

I went to the ER again Friday in the evening at the direction of my neurosurgeon and was really a positive experience.

I handled myself with dignity. I told the ER doctor I was in recovery, in severe pain, and pain meds were up to him as he determined necessary. My blood pressure was incredibly high.

He ordered oral valium, intramuscular dilaudid and an intramuscular steroid shot. We decided not to do a take home script of narcotics so in light of that he wrote for a short supply of a muscle relaxant for home.

The ER doctor also encouraged me to come back over the weekend and not let it get overly bad. If I so need it.

My sponsor told me it wasn’t a relapse because of the medical necessity of it and the way I conducted myself with the ER Physician. So today, I have 41 Days Sober.

The BEST bit though is the steroid shot 2 days out of the ER I’m in the least amount of pain I’ve ever been in. I’m sitting a 1-2 pain level. When normally I’m at a 4-6 pain wise. I haven’t felt this much relief in YEARS. Sure my arm is numb, weak, and tingly still but the pain is significantly better. I haven't stopped smiling all day.

This leads me to my resentment. For all these years I’ve been told by a top hospital in the USA that I have inflammation problems. Not once did anyone give me a steroid shot. It took me finding a random doctor in a neighboring state at the far edge of the main city to get adequate care. I’m kinda sorta really pissed about it., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/9ei39z/spinal_surgery_update_a_resentment/

TITLE: I'm in ICU, POST BODY: Early Monday morning around 2am I got up to go get a glass of water downstairs, because i had a night terror and was really in pain. Even I  was convinced it was just anxiety. 

When reaching for a glass to pour the water i tuned my head and stretched a bit to get the glass. Never got it because when made that  movement my whole neck cracked followed by a loud pop.

So, outside I went to get air.  I found myself sitting on the backyard patio dizzy with severe shooting pains and classic problems like tingling and full blown nausea.  Pain sky rocketed from 2 to 8 in 30 minutes the dizziness was so bad i called 911. I simply couldn't stand up. I was too afraid of falling than anything else. 

So paramedics came in the back gate and transported me to the hospital because that 8 jumped to yikes the second they did that bp was also 145/108 with 110 pain rate.  

The ER doctor was an asshole and wouldn't give me anything addictive including benadryl iv and insisted on a 2nd CT Scan that showed no changes according to him and that I just had a pinched nerve.  I countered with, "well, why does my neurosurgeon say the screws are loose upon his evacuation of the CT?" The ER doctor was arrogant and said he must've looked at it wrong because he might've been rushing.  

So he was more than happy to call my neurosurgeon at 6am to evaluate it carefully to calm my nerves but went off shift at 7am. 

Well he calls the neurosurgeon at 6am by this time its been 5hrs and I've recieved oral flexril and an IM benadryl shot. 

Without an IV at 6am the neurosurgeon said i needed an admission so neurosurgeon could be down there and see me/evaluate my 2 CTs and MRI. The ER doc was reluctant to admit me and told me I'd likely go home after the neurosurgeon determined it wasn't serious. 

I almost believed him and almost took him up on the offer to discharge me at that very moment where u could follow up outpatient. I didn't though because by the grace of my higher power my neurosurgeon was going to already be doing  surgeries at the hospital I was at.  So I stuck around to get the MRI read and and calm my anxiety so that i could go home with peace of mind and throw out my flexeril. 

I spent 8hours in tears, but remained calm convinced it was all an 8hr long panic attack. The ER doc went off shift. A new ER doctor came in and just reinforced the original ER doctor's sentiments.

Finally, 10 hours later the neurosurgeon arrives and cofims that I indeed DO HAVE LOOSE SCREWS and ontop of that the whole plate is shifted causing c5 where a spacer is starting to herinate and is punching my spinal column likely causing my severe pain.  He put me on his Operating Schedule for the day ordered me a 1mg dilaudid shot and then 3hours later I underwent major surgery.  

I am currently hospitalized in the ICU following surgery and have been pushing the narcotics off as much as possible. Dilaudid is ordered every 4hrs. I've had opportunities for 4 doses. Due to the medical necessity I am still  43 sober as of today.  

I've been reaching out taking each problem at a time as well as not future tripping. Im also proud for staying calm in the ER and leaving it to my higher power., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/9ewuza/im_in_icu/

TITLE: I'm Really Struggling to Come to Terms with the Way I was Treated in the ER Recently, POST BODY: On Monday morning around 3am I made my way to the emergency department. I had to be brought in by ambulance because my breathing patterns were off and the pain in my neck was severe. I had cracked/popped it in the process of reaching for a glass of water in the upper cabinets. In the ambulance they gave me oxygen and attempted (but failed) to start an IV. 

In the ER I was seen by lets call him Dr. Andy. 

I sit down with Dr. Andy and am very forthcoming/truthful. I explain that I've struggled with addiction in the past, that I have 40ish days clean and am not looking to go down the opiate road, but am going to need something to help me get to my Tuesday night appointment.

Well Dr. Andy heavily encourages me to go ahead and get a 2nd CT Scan down. He gives me this big convincing lecture on how they're much safer than smoking and radiating me twice in one week would really be useful to him because he'd know exactly what was wrong. I was very hesitant to get scanned, after all, I've been scanned 50+ times in the last 10 years.

Upon explaining this he pulls up my original CT from 3 days ago and shows me exactly how it looks just fine and if I'm experiencing more pain and problems I should definitely get another CT Scan. So, I consent to that. Upon coming out of the CT Scanner he comes back with my results and says, "Looks like they're just fine! Just like your original ones! I suspected as much, you have nothing to worry about, you should go home!" I look at him and say, "well then why would my (very skilled) neurosurgeon tell me otherwise?" 

At this point Dr. Andy perks up and says he can call my neurosurgeon to verify but can't do it till 7am ish when they're waking up so he doesn't ruin their sleep the night before surgery. That's understandable so I tell Dr. Andy, "That's great an all, however, how am I going to cope for 6 hours. I'm in more pain than I can honestly handle."

Dr. Andy makes a huge point that he's not going to give me narcotics, benzos, or muscle relaxants. So, with all that limiting me, I ask Dr. Andy to put in an IV line, give me fluids, because I have dehydration isssues and am fading plus fluids/hydration helps pain in general. I ask for IV Zofran, IV Benadryl and IV Torodol.

He straighup lies to me "Dori, your insurance won't cover IV Fluids or IV medications." I respond tell him if I start vomiting we're going to have more problems than I came in with because the pain is that intense I am queasy. He reiteraites that fluids aren't covered by my insurance (total lie) so I respond and say, "well my family owns a buncha property and if it comes to my health a bag of ER Fluids can't cost more than $3k - I can pay upfront and out of pocket for that." He stops and finally gives me the real reason he doesn't want to do anything IV.

It's because my CT Scan looks fine, my neurosurgeon is wrong, I really oughta go home and I get a lecture on how benadryl is addictive according to studies involving sickle cell patients. At this point its too intense, I start to sob gently and tell him we're at crossroads and I just need help till he can consult my neurosurgeon.

He finally agrees to give me an oral zofran and Intramuscular benadryl shot because intramuscular benadryl isn't addictive or w/e. 

7am rolls around and he tells me I'm being admitted, that the nurse will try for an IV but if they don't get it they're not putting one in for my admission since I'll likely go home after the neurosurgeon reads my MRI and CTs. Luckily the nurse got the IV for me and at about 9am my neurosurgeon sees me in the ER, Dr. Andy's shift ends and my neurosurgeon is appalled. 

I've been laying there for almost 10 hours gently sobbing due to the pain and he immediately orders a pain medication. He also says its a good thing I didn't leave. The MRI showed a lot of damage and I was put on the operating schedule for that same day. He gets me settled and comfy, but Oh my fucking god. 10 hours laying there without pain relief just because I'm a "junkie" it felt so demoralizing and inhumane. 

Makes me not want to disclose my addiction to my doctors, but for fucks sake I know I need to do the right thing. I just wish doctors weren't so passive aggressive and mean spirited. All he heard was the word "addiction" and thought I was drug seeking.

I guess this is the price I pay for having an addiction.

TITLE: An Open Letter to the Person Who Was Angry I Shared in a Meeting the Other Day, POST BODY: Dear Narcotics Anonymous Member,

I've been going through some real difficult shit lately. What I spoke about in the meeting was only the tip of the iceberg. You don't me and I don't know, however, what I do know is I don't blame or judge you. So, when you came up to me and told me I wasn't 49 days sober and needed to take a newcomers chip for my relapse I politely declined. 

You seemed upset by this, however, I am indeed clean.

You see in the "In Times of Illness" Pamphlet that I suggested you read it says "***Cleantime is an issue for each of us to resolve individually with our sponsor and our Higher Power.***" As far as my sponsor, higher power, and I are concerned I'm clean because I've been taking my medication exactly as prescribed.

Just imagine it, you're newly sober, and you get into a horrific car accident. You require major surgery and your doctor sits you down and places your drug of choice in front of you and tells you, you need to take it otherwise you're body won't get the rest it needs to heal and  that it's cruel and unusual to suffer through the pain.

This brings up a myriad of problems. Can you really take it as prescribed? How can you not abuse it? How long will you need it for? Will you need to go through withdrawals to get off of it? What can you do to stay accountable?

For me each of those questions were answered as I faced the biggest challenge of my recovery only 40 or so days in. So, I've been taking the steps I need to, to manage my addiction with prescribed pills on board without jeopardizing my cleantime. I've worked too hard to throw it away just because I required a necessary surgery. Everyday I'm terrified of slipping up. It's a good and healthy fear. 

What I've been doing to not overtake or slip up is follow a plan that works for me. For me it means:

* Texting my sponsor everytime I take a dose.
* Using Timercaps to make sure I don't miscalculate when a dose is due
* Going to meetings and sharing about my fears
* Communicating with my support network both NA/AA &amp; Normies
* Encouraging my family to check in on me and ask about how I'm managing
* Being open and honest about what I need versus what I don't need

I've also been leaving it up to my higher power to let the doctors determine what is best for me instead of me, suggesting what I think needs to be done. 

I'm sorry if I offended you in my short and blunt responses, it's been a lot for me to handle, but at the sametime I felt the need to stand up for myself. 

Sincerely,

Dori with 50days of Sobriety as of Today., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/9gwl7v/an_open_letter_to_the_person_who_was_angry_i/

Here is a picture of the aftermath of what happened after surgery. To think the ER doctor just wanted to send me home because, "nothing was wrong," was just bizarre. I'm glad I stood my ground.

*WARNING: Just a fair warning if you're sensitive and don't like anything gory don't click the link below. It's of my scar with 15 staples in it and is not for the squeamish.*

[Take a look at the aftermath](https://i.imgur.com/k6XUv4B.jpg)

Plus I have a nifty scar now and as far as i'm concerned it's the coolest thing. Some people collect tattoos. I've got scar collection going on.

In other news, I'm really starting to give myself credit. I've been sticking to my script 100% and for me that is a huge, huge, huge deal. These[timer cap things](https://i.imgur.com/Qk18mpT.jpg) have really been helping to keep me accountable too. I text a picture with the time on it every time I take a dose to my sponsor. Which has kept me in communication with her 3x/day at least. Which means I'm checking in more.  All very helpful things. I've also not been taking it if I don't need it and throughout the night can sleep soundly enough without a dose through the night. Although there have been times where I've watched and waited for it turn from 5hrs 50mins to 6hrs so I can take it. I'm not perfect but I'm sticking with the plan., PERMALINK: /r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/9i5uqi/the_aftermath_of_my_surgery/

TITLE: Facing my WORST Fears in Recovery., POST BODY: [Today I picked up this beauty.](https://i.imgur.com/TO5vtgE.jpg) I am facing my worst nightmare in recovery. Surgery \*shudders\*. As a result I've been placed back on the narcotics but the only reason I'm maintaining my clean time is because I'm doing my due diligence to not abuse the script even a little bit. I have nifty timer caps and have a plan with my sponsor to keep me on track.

I was supposed to be done with my scripts on Tuesday. OK great. I took my last dose at 5am and at 9am I made my doctor calls. Pain management would see me in a week, my hematologist could hydrate me that day and maybe my psychiatrist could prescribe comfort medications for the upcoming withdrawal.

I got to my hematologist at 10:30am. He squeezed me in. I trust him so much. When I slipped up and tried Heroin he was one of the first people I called to tell to get help from. He's seen me through a lot. He is an incredible human and I'm grateful he took me under his wing when I was just 23 and didn't know what the fuck was happening with my pancreas.

Anyway I digress. We try 6 times for an IV line before opting to put it in my foot. We decide on 2 liters of fluids and a toradol shot. My arm and neck are hurting way more than usual and I'm trying to suss out if it's in my head, withdrawal or actual pain. It's especially confusing because this is neurosurgeon stuff. This doctor doesn't deal with that. 

Out of frustration I start to bawl as I realize the toradol just isn't cutting it (it usually is just enough) but not 3 weeks out of major cervical surgery it isn't doing a thing. It's now 3pm. I'm in tears from the pain. I tend to cry when I'm really hurting or whimper and stuff. So, even though I'm not on the schedule to see him that day he finds the time for me. 

I just honestly express that I have a pain management appointment in a week, I was trying to manage on 2 weeks worth of pain meds but obviously it's not happening and I bluntly said, "I Don't want to be in the ER nightly, doctor shopping or on the streets."  He asks about the suboxone and I tell him how I'm no longer on it and that it was a mess for me. He pulls my DEA report which doesn't have my 2 last fills on it so I show him the bottles with the nifty timer caps on them and whatnot. 

We talk seriously and he goes ahead and authorizes a 1mg dilaudid shot in his office and writes me a script to fill for a weeks worth of pain medication to bridge me to my appointment with the pain management doctor. I'm excited about this appointment because he does non-narcotic pain management and everything. Right now my only reservation is withdrawals and pain. I absolutely need the pain to calm down before I do the withdrawal thing. I've had 4 withdrawals since November. Each lasting 7-10 days. Putting myself through that a 5th time of withdrawals just sound so icky.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really hoping this new pain doctor can help. I really do because, I can't keep doing this. 

At the end of the day though, I'm really proud of me for not abusing my script, taking as prescribed, maintaining my clean time and communicating lots with my sponsor.

TITLE: Drug Test Concern...(already been scouring google for days), POST BODY:  So IDk I've been googling this for days. So I'm asking the stupid question here.

I had a drug test at my doctors office to make sure I didn't test for anything off the wall or illicit. They're sending the results to a lab for full evaluation. So, me being me, and being super paranoid about random drugs showing up tests herself with one of her dori instant tests at home.

I came up positive for exactly what I thought I would:

* THC - likely a low level of it since I rarely EVER smoke &amp; am in a legal state
* Benzos - Duh, I've been on valium post op
* Opiates - Yes, I've been on those consistently, since surgery but will be out in a day or two. MmmmK.
* Suboxone was inconclusive .... my last dose was 45 days ago so likely a non issue.

Here's where I'm concerned:

Methadone. I tested fucking positive for methadone. I would fly to australia if someone put methadone in front of me so I KNOW it's a false positive. What I don't know is if lab testing will reveal that or ??? I've scoured the web looking for things that can cause a false methadone positive and so far the only thing that came up that it MIGHT be the benadryl. With that said, the only other thing i can think of is that it must've been in the heroin I tried 67 days ago but I highly doubt it would be THAT long lasting in my system?

TITLE: I'm Seriously Considering Going Out on Marijuana, POST BODY: I have 69 days clean. Ha. What load of shit that is. I had spinal surgery on September 10th at 40ish days clean and then it was OK to accept the script from the doc so long as I took it as prescribed. I did that. I took it just as prescribed. Then, when I finally got into pain management I was honest with the doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

My opioid abuse has primarily been my prescribed medication. There was a time for 7 days in 2017 where I attempted to IV Oxymorphone that was scripted to me, I went through 120 dilaudid tablets in 10 days and I told the doctor that as recently as July 24th-July 29th, 2018 that I did a major fuck it because of pain and snorted heroin for 4 days. My pain doctor won't prescribe, he's prepared me for W/Ds with clonidine and a steroid pack for inflammation. I'm just freaked the fuck out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sitting here typing and shaking at a serious 9+ painscore. I called my neurosurgeon early this evening and he said that's normal for a patient 3 weeks out of the type of surgery I had. So I had some validation there. I just made a script that was supposed to be out on October 2nd be out about 18hrs ago. I mean it's not a high dosage but the pain, combined with rebound pain from the opiates, combined with withdrawal symptoms is something that becomes a real problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's technically not opiates related, but it is too and I want to tell a happy story dammit.

I've been sober for 72 days now and it hasn't been easy. Last week Tuesday I was SO worried that my boyfriend of just over one year would break up with me. In my sobriety I opened up to him about the depths of my addiction. I let him in dangerously close. Something I'm not used to.

These last two Tuesdays have been intense, but to the good news, my boyfriend tricked me into getting dressy for a "fancy lunch" because he's leaving on a job for a month in the next day or two and might have been leaving as early as "tonight".

So I got all fancied up and we went out. Much to my surprise at the restaurant he proposed to me. I am now engaged and my boyfriend is now my fiance.

I've been feeling badly for 2+ days. 1 day ago I went to a place that does IV hydration/toradol/zofran that was a nurse practitioner. Spent $200 on it to avoid the ER/Hospital. It helped a little but less than 24hrs hours later I was vomiting at 4am-8am six times. All bile greenish/yellowish and foamy. It really upset my entire stomach. I got to the ER at 9am and wasn't seen till 11am. After that, I was in the ER from 11am - 6pm before being moved up to a room. 

No pain medications. There was a request to have pain management at the hospital see me for non-narcotic management which may or may not involve ketamine, but they didn't see patients past 5pm for that so I was SOL with that.

At this point I've been writhing in pain for days. I tried to go through the appropriate channels and have my nurse call my doctors to prescribe me something just to get through to the morning. None of them would because GI had a massive note in my chart not to give me pain medication.

Like I know pain medication isn't the answer but sitting at a solid 8 of pain for so many hours gets wearing and I finally lost it. I called up my internist and was like, "what am I supposed to do here?!" then, my GI called me back because I had left a very exasperated message on his voicemail and was all like "we don't want to lead you back to drugs." I was just like again, "what choice do I have? Will a one time dose really get me back into or onto the drugs?" He eventually conceded and was all "fine one dose." 

&amp; I got it.

Plus, it worked - did it's job. Helped break the pain cycle and I don't think I need anymore of the narcotic. I'm just sick of walking around in a 6 pain score and then being treated badly when i'm in an 8+ because I made the decision to get off the narcotics on my own.

TITLE: Dori Finding Kid Update, POST BODY: Hello Everyone,

I still haven't reached "Kid"  this is my last update on this until something new happens. 

I sent a letter roughly 20 days ago to the address I had on file. I suspect his family received the letter and likely sent me a glitter bomb in the mail. Which means, they probably don't want to talk to me. So, I won't be sending any more letters. I really miss KID and am hoping for the best but the more I think about it the more I worry.

Thanks for listening,

TITLE: Results of My Doctor's Appointment Today for Pain Management..., POST BODY: My doctor recommended the Butrans Patch, but it needs to go through prior authorization with my insurance and that can take up to two weeks if not longer.

So in the meantime, he scripted me 8mg pills of Subutex he told me to cut them down to quarters and start there.  He wrote for a two week supply 2x/day so 30 pills of 8mgs, but my insurance only covers 7 days worth so I got 14 pills instead. 

Luckily I'll be cutting them into halves and fourths so I won't need to get more than '7 days worth' each month until we can petition the insurance and get them to either approve the Butrans patch or whatever. If I like the Subutex I can work with him to stay on that versus the Butrans patch, but he's totally willing to give me a hand with everything which is helpful. 

If I get on the Subutex regularly and we can get the insurance to allow more than '7 days worth' then I can stockpile it and never be truly out unlike what would happen with my regular oxycodone.

Also, I'm debating not telling my sponsor about this. I don't feel like being judged in NA for needing this right now, but I know I need the program itself to get better overall., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/9xfun8/results_of_my_doctors_appointment_today_for_pain/

TITLE: Subutex Has Saved My Life, POST BODY: Two weeks ago, I went to my Suboxone doctor who also specializes in chronic pain. After a long discussion, we settled on Subutex. Much to my surprise, he scripted me 8mg 2x/day. I've been needing closer to 1-2mgs 2x/day. So basically a quarter of an 8mg tablet holds me really well. 

I honestly think the Naloxone in Suboxone was causing me hell. Having just the buprenorphine has saved me. My anxiety is noticeably less intense, I have more energy throughout the day, I'm not going to bed early to avoid crippling pain and I haven't been to the ER in a few weeks! Those two things alone are huge.

I still haven't told my sponsor about it, the way I plan to let her in is just tell her that when I see my doctor I'm going to go ahead and try the Subutex. That I seriously need pain relief and don't want to do anything shady or illicit. I have a feeling she'll be okay with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway! yeah!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/a1897z/subutex_has_saved_my_life/

Woah-WOW much?

This year was incredible for me. Which is saying a lot because I suffer from Schizoaffective Disorder w/Major Depression Subtype. I used to be suicidal. In 2017 I thought for sure I wouldn't live to be 30. Yet here I am. 30 and going strong. Having gotten the chance to see how well my life can and is turning out makes me so happy that I was never successful in any suicide attempts or acted on any rash thoughts. I was killing myself slowly though. With narcotics. Which I am now off of and it feels so good.

Here's all that happened:

1. I got ENGAGED to my boyfriend after 1 year
2. I got off of my prescription narcotic medication
3. I paid off $10,000 worth of debt

While it is "only" three accomplishments, there's a lot that goes into each one. Especially getting off of the narcotic medication. That was a big deal and quite painful to do in the first place let alone maintain it. I still hurt every day, but at least I am free from being dependant on a little pill.

I have some goals for 2019 now:

1. Lose 45-50 Pounds
2. Get the Wedding Planned for 2020
3. Stay off the Narcotic Medications
4. Pay off the Remaining $20,000 Debt I have
5. Re-Launch my Website on Chronic Illness

It's good to have goals. Along with goals I am also grateful. So here is that list for you to enjoy:

1. Christmas
2. All My Future In-Laws
3. My Future Mother In-Law
4. My Fiancé
5. Christmas Cookies
6. Oatmeal
7. Coffee
8. Getting Better from a NASTY Cold
9. Presents

11. My Favorite Breakfast Diner
12. Carefree Days with a Friend
13. My New Printer
14. Snagging a 1bed/1bath Apt.
15. My Fireplace/TV Console
16. Holiday Songs by my Best Friend
17. Finding a pair of missing gloves
18. Having a clean apartment

I used to shit on that program so much. I used to hate it and think everyone there was a delusional brainwashed religious nut job who took everything to the extreme. After getting involved in it, I discovered it is actually a super useful program that provided me with a new way of looking at life. I was stunned by how much fun the fellowship of NA is and am super lucky to have a strong fellowship where I live.

As for the religious side of NA here is a little summary of what NA really is when it comes to your higher power or religious beliefs: [https://i.imgur.com/5V6xKnJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5V6xKnJ.jpg)

For instance, for me, my "higher power" is this concept that you get back what you put out into the world. If you put a lot of good in - you'll ultimately get good back. I take negative experiences as, "not as bad as I think they are" and "a learning experience," it really helps me cope with day to day life and so much higher power is simply the idea that I am not in control of what happens, but I am capable of making good &amp; healthy decisions.

My Narcotics Anonymous Sponsor dropped me as a sponsee, for the curious [here is our text exchange](https://imgur.com/a/algu9Qa). Also, to those that it seems like I keep whining about this situation to, I'm just having a hard time processing it and am doing all I can to manage my negative feelings surrounding the event. 

I'm really hurt because I gave this sponsor everything. Every dirty, dark, embarrassing, or otherwise unpleasant thing about me. I was 100% honest with her and it just feels like she left me behind when I gave it my all. 

To think my all landed me here is very unsettling and disconcerting. So, it's taken me time to deal with this. Please be gentle.

# The Letter

To My Old Sponsor:

I’ve gone over and picked apart our text messages word-by-word trying to figure out where things went wrong. I guess I went wrong by not understanding your expectations versus mine.

Someone pointed out to me that I would trade friends for drugs so in recovery it would make sense to trade recovery for friends. Except, that isn’t me. I struggled greatly to come up with a time I missed an outing with friends or even appointments such as doctors due to my drug use.

That wasn’t my experience. So, I didn’t make the connection of the importance of the Sunday meeting especially because I had mentioned my plans prior, and you were okay with it then.

Just for context not that it matters, some things unknown to you was that it wasn’t ‘just’ a meaningless super bowl party with people I could see anytime. I had been planning it for a few weeks and committed my time for it to Adam. More importantly, I had a few select friends coming including one with Sickle Cell that I’m overly protective of and rarely get to see.

When seeing her got threatened, I think I kind of freaked out. Originally I was going to try to make it and just leave the Sunday meeting early, but when that seemed unacceptable too, I decided not to go at all.

I was mad because, it felt like I was being judged.

I decided to wait till Monday night or Tuesday to message you after our interaction because I knew you were working. Then, I was shocked to see you didn’t want to work through things. That you just wanted to walk away.

That made an impression on me for sure. I was definitely hurt, because never did I think the relationship would end over one and two missed check-ins. That is why I still sent in my gratitude list.

I don’t know if I’m ever going to send this to you, I just know I needed to express myself. I had to take a 2-week break from meetings because I was beyond angry and didn’t trust myself to not blow up and say regretful things in any meeting.

I’ve slowly been returning to meetings and now my problem is the Sunday meeting. I feel like I can’t go to it, because I’m still too upset about our interaction. I need to release that anger. I hope this letter helps. Even if it is unsent.

A very saddened,

Dori, PERMALINK: /r/NarcoticsAnonymous/comments/auh541/an_unsent_letter_to_my_narcotics_anonymous_sponsor/

TITLE: "Then That's Good because It's on you Not the Doctor.", POST BODY: This is sort of opioid-related. I just need to talk and rant with my r/opiates fam because you guys understand it all more than anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

The other night I went to the ER. I was in EXTREME pain. More so than usual. I normally NEVER ask for opiates anymore because they don't give them to me and I don't really want them, I, however, always expected in an extreme situation they'd treat the human, not the addiction. 

Whelp. 

I was wrong.

At the ER I told the doctor I seriously needed pain relief that it was way beyond what I could physically cope with, that I need to be treated with dignity and properly. She tells me that she can look into getting me another Subutex dose. I tell her no, I really need a legitimate opioid right now. She goes, "how about Torodol?" So, I get that, and a little later I ask her why she can't give me a dose of pain medications for legitimate flares. She gives me a pamphlet that says, "We don't give IV medications for flareups of chronic pain, but we do give oral medication instead." So, I asked for something oral and she told me no and walked off.

I turned to the nurse and stated: "All that does is make people want to use heroin."

The nurse then says: "T***hen that's good because it's on you and not the doctor and the doctor's license.***"  So I ask about the oath to do no harm and the nurse tells me he's not going to argue it with me.

It's so fucking disgusting.

IDK The point of this ... I just needed to rant. I get it that I'm in recovery and that I'm not actively using, aside from Subutex, I'm just frustrated and angry that in legitimate situations I'm treated less than dog crap all because I made the decision to get off day to day opiates., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bjbkif/then_thats_good_because_its_on_you_not_the_doctor/

I am of the opinion that everyone deserves regardless of addiction or not need to be treated properly for any conditions they may that requires pain medication.

BODY: Yea, No I know its the bupenorphine that blocks the opiates from working.

However I also know after 12hrs of not taking a 2mg dose withdrawals set in and that's how I know to take the next 2mg for the day.  I get legit symptoms usually starting with uncontrollable sweating and loose bowel movements when my norm is to be exceptionally constipated. 

I did speak to my doctor who perscribes the subutex about breakthrough pain so I can handle myself with dignity and not be groveling at the ER so he's agreed to script me 15 15mg oxycodones every 3 months. It's been 1.5 months and I'm out. That script saved me from visiting the ER or missing work roughly 7 times in the last 1.5 months

I'll be seeing him next month so I guess I'll see what his thoughts are at that time.  Alternatively I'm considering going off of the bupenorphine, waiting patiently for 6 months and then consulting with a new team of doctors because mine are overly jaded and fucked up.

BODY: IDK. I'm in a very confusing spot in terms of junkie vs. Not a junkie. I've had people in NA straigghtup say I dont belong because I have a legitimate need for opioids given my condition and I've heard the opposite. That a drug is a drug is a drug.   As well as everything in between.

I lead a meeting this past week and was brutally honest about the depths of my addiction and people there made some really judgemental remarks about how I don't belong etc. 

Weather or not I'm a junkie is besides the point for me when it come to a critical situation where the pain is legitimately overwhelmingly bad. 

I am of the belief that I'm a human first before being a junkie and deserve basic humane and respectful treatment. If that means I absolutely need a dose of opioids because the pain is so bad I am wishing I was dead ... well then I dont think a single dose to get some rest and calm things down is a bad thing.

BODY: I have a rare pancreatic disorder that leads to chronic pancreatitis. It was so bad at one point I was on a feeding tube for 3 years where I did not consume food whatsoever to lower the pain/need for pain medications but that is only sustainable for so long. 

I also have degenerative disc disease that almost paralyzed me. I've had two major spinal surgeries.  

I'm on the subutex right now for the last three months but I've been off of everything for over 12 months since November of 2017.  Although those 12 months aren't consecutive because different things were tried at different times. 

I've been through withdrawals 6 times since November 2017 and the only reason I take the subutex is to not go into withdrawals.  I just dont have the mental capacity to deal with that special hell of pain at the moment. 

I'm not asking for day to day opiates either.  I'm asking for opiates during intense pain flares where I'm hospitalized and/or in the ER requiring them.

TITLE: Is having Narcan in a meeting "Paraphernalia?", POST BODY: I was given some Narcan way back when and I recently noticed it's in a purse I regularly use and carry with me. Therefore it's ended up in meetings from time to time. I never discuss having it, I don't pull it out, I don't mention it, but it's there. I figure if I'm gonna run into an OD the most likely place (for me) would be at a meeting with a newcomer who isn't dedicated yet. 

IDK should I get rid of it or not bring it to meetings? I just feel like it's safer/better to just leave it in my purse. Ya know?  Just in case., PERMALINK: /r/NarcoticsAnonymous/comments/botj1k/is_having_narcan_in_a_meeting_paraphernalia/

TITLE: I wanna hear from those of you who are recovering!, POST BODY: I was wondering for all of those people out there that still frequent the darkside of reddit, but are clean, I want to know how did you do it? What keeps you motivated? How do you define yourself and what is the best thing about being off the drugs for you?

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I got off by ripping it off like a band-aid went cold turkey off a high dosage of oral Dilaudid that I was boofing. I ultimately got off the dope that way but my physical pain is enormous and the only thing that could destroy my recovery so, I'm now doing it with Subutex onboard. Although admittedly I regret getting on it and take the bare minimum to stay out of withdrawals from it. Simply because I mentally cannot handle withdrawals again. I've also been staying clean with the help of NA although I do feel like with the Subutex I'm not 100% honest. At the same time, my sponsor knows about it and I do what I can.

I stay motivated by all the good things that have happened to me since I started this journey. I'm engaged, have a great job, and deal with less pain day to day than I ever did when I was using, so go figure. Although, there are days where a painkiller would really help and there have been days in recovery where I've needed it for things like spinal surgery.

For me, the best thing about being off of it is living life again. I have more energy, less pain, and feel more fulfilled. I thought I was living when I was using but, little did I know I think I was actually dying., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bqp92e/i_wanna_hear_from_those_of_you_who_are_recovering/

TITLE: Am I Clean? A Liar? Or Just ???, POST BODY: I have a severe chronic pain condition. I got addicted to the pain medication that was prescribed to me. I went full-blown addict. It got so bad that I tried heroin at one point and I attempted to inject my pills at one point. So no denying it I earned my seat in the Narcotics Anonymous Fellowship. At the same time, there is no denying that I am in pain on a daily basis at varying intensities at any given moment in time. The best example I can give is like appendicitis ... on a daily basis that waxes and weans. I have severe chronic pancreatitis and no matter what I do it never seems to be under control. Just to give you a picture of the severity of my medical condition I've been hospitalized more times than I can count, I nearly died once after a surgery that made my pancreatitis worse and was hospitalized for over a month, I've had multiple surgeries, a feeding tube, and have been on all kinds of medications. 

After I detoxed off my pain pills, I went without for about 6 months. I had 2 1-day relapses during that time and reset my clock each time. Finally, I decided that it wasn't working being 100% clean. I just couldn't physically do it. My quality of life was suffering and I was becoming more and more non-functional physical pain and the depression that comes with the aftermath of addiction is brutal.

At 80 days clean I was hospitalized for pancreatitis and my doctors made some decisions regarding my medical care.

Well, that's when I first realized in Narcotics Anonymous eyes, I now had 0 days not 80. 

My sponsor decided to drop me because she felt uncomfortable with the way my physicians were handling my addiction and medical care. She did not see me as being clean, she felt she wanted me to be clean more than I wanted to be clean, and that I would never be successful at this so long as I continued seeking out medical care like I was. 

I wholeheartedly disagree with my old sponsor. I want to be clean, I did not SEEK OUT medical care in a manipulative way. I simply asked "how do you handle this sort of thing without opiates?" my doctors were honest with me that there are no good answers, something I'm used to hearing, and that we had to work together and if we both put in our best I SHOULD be okay. They recommended a combination of Subutex and ketamine infusions. 

So, that's what I got started on and that's what my old sponsor threw a fit about. I posted here a while back thinking she was angry over a series of text messages where I valued the Superbowl over attending a single meeting. I found out later that the real reason she dropped me was that she didn't like how my doctors were handling my care. 

She basically said because I wasn't going to be successful in overcoming my addiction she didn't want to sponsor me even though I pointed out to her the only requirement for membership was a desire to be clean and that I definitely had/have. 

Whilst I have the desire, she is right to an extent though. I'll never be truly clean. At that 80 day mark and hospitalization, I did not reset my counter at the same time I haven't taken my 90-day chip or 6 months one and have basically stopped counting the days. I  just feel the time "clean" doesn't matter as much as the bigger picture of it does for me.

Now I've found a new temporary sponsor who is okay with my Subutex/ketamine routine, but what she doesn't know is 50 days ago my Subutex doctor and I were talking about ways to cut down on ER visits. The driving force in my ER visits is the severity of the pain. Then, I get to the ER and they have to use a bunch of alternative medications to bring the pain level down to something I can cope with. So, we talked it over and he and I decided to try out a breakthrough regime. 

So he prescribed me 10 pills of narcotics at a mid-level dosage to take at home ORALLY when the vomiting calmed down to keep me out of the ER and to stop me from being pumped full of a bunch of alternatives and potentially dangerous to my kidneys and other organs medications and to keep me from wasting my time and to stop wasting the ER resources even though I need them this can be managed at home with the right resources.

So, 50 days ago after he wrote that script I stocked up on Gatorade, heat packs, and some other comfort items for when I do get violently ill like peppermint/lavender oil, bath salts, and whatnot.

The instruction was simple when the attack comes on I would wait 12 hours from my last dose of Subutex to take the pain pill for it to be effective. Which was okay with me because by the time I'd get to the ER and being treated there 12-24hrs would've gone by anyway. 

With those 10 pills, I didn't go to the ER once. I used them on 7 different occasions over 50 days. It was a complete success. So, when I went in this month well month and a half later really, my doctor was okay with renewing that script and sticking to that program so long as it keeps me out of the ER. So, I have a full bottle of medication that I haven't touched (go me!) and I feel good/secure about my medical plan.

What I don't feel secure about is my spot in Narcotics Anonymous. I feel like a total fraud at the same time while I know I don't fit the model entirely, I know I need the help on some level there are a lot of aspects of the program that I identify with and could benefit from and grow as a human from. So, IDK, I guess I'm wondering am I an asshole for not being open about my medical situation. Note that I have yet to talk to my new sponsor about the pain pills. I'm just a bit timid/scared of what happened with my last sponsor happening again.

Don't get me wrong, it's not a total secret friends of mine inside and out of the program know what's going on, but not everyone does and that's where I feel like I might be being deceptive and I'm really stressed over it. Also, should I pick up a 9-month chip when that comes up in the next month-ish or just continue to not truly count the days? I feel like I'm living the NA program through the eyes of the In Times of Illness Pamphlet., PERMALINK: /r/NarcoticsAnonymous/comments/bt2f9e/am_i_clean_a_liar_or_just/

TITLE: Binaural Beats Sound Crazy - But With Nothing to Lose I Tried Them &amp; Definitely Got High., POST BODY: I've been using Binaural Beats lately for a few things like:

* To Help My Chronic Pain
* To Reduce Anxiety
* To Engage in Meditation/Relaxation
* To Subdue Stress
* To Calm Down from Anger
* To Study
* &amp; more...

Mind you I don't get high on Binaural Beats now because I'm on Subutex, but prior to that, I was in shock by how well these audio tracks worked. I still use them to this day to help my pain, I just don't get that high sensation I used to. So, if you're a heavy H user you might not notice anything, but if you are in withdrawals, new to recovery or craving in recovery, they might be the solution you need.

# What are Binaural Beats?

Binaural beats therapy is an emerging form of soundwave therapy in which the right and left ears listen to two slightly different frequency tones yet perceive the tone as one.

The binaural auditory beat that a person hears is the difference in frequency between the left and the right ear and should be at frequencies lower than 1000 hertz (Hz) for the brain to detect the binaural beat.

For example, if the left ear registers a tone at 200 Hz and the right at 210 Hz, the binaural beat heard is the difference between the two frequencies — 10 Hz. [\[...Read More At The Source Here\]](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320019.php)

# Can Binaural Beats Get You High?

Binaural beats are precisely-designed audio tracks that claim to get you high by inducing the brainwave associated with particular controlled substances. It's totes legal.

Predicated on the notion that binaural brainwaves are responsible for every conceivable state of consciousness, the tracks supposedly sync brainwaves to make you feel fine.

[Additional Reading - We Try Out Sound Waves That Get You High Just Like Drugs](https://www.thekindland.com/wellness/we-try-out-sound-waves-that-get-you-high-just-1787)

# Are Binaural Beats Dangerous?

Based on the current scientific research available, no serious risks or side effects of listening to binaural beats have been reported.

As with all sound, listening at a very high volume can damage your eardrums.

Use over-the-ear headphones to minimize potential damage. The very best headphones are the noise-cancelling ones, but they can be expensive.

Whichever headphones you use, please make an effort to be kind to your ears: they’re the only ones you get.

**There are however concerns in special situations/cases that you need to be aware of:**

There are no known side effects to listening to binaural beats, but you’ll want to make sure that the sound level coming through your headphones isn’t set too high. Lengthy exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss over time. This is roughly the level of noise produced by heavy traffic.

Binaural beat technology could be a problem if you have epilepsy, so you should speak to your doctor before trying it. More research is needed to see if there are any side effects to listening to binaural beats over a long period of time.

Side Note: It's Not Recommended to Drive After Listening to Binaural Beats because it does impair you to some extent. [\[...Read More At The Souce Here\]](https://www.healthline.com/health/binaural-beats#side-effects)

# In Closing

You can find free tracks for binaural beats on YouTube. This is an opiate one that I really like. I'd be curious if others could let me know what their experience was when they listened to binaural beats. I can imagine that collectively the results would be interesting. Especially from a bunch of addicts.

Remember, listen with headphones. It's much more effective that way., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/btfer4/binaural_beats_sound_crazy_but_with_nothing_to/

I understand your logic. I really do, because I did the same thing to myself. It led to a full blown opiate addiction and ultimately, I lost my script because of it. Now I'm regretfully on Subutex that doesn't touch my pain and have learned to deal with a level of maximum level 8 pain. I vomit on a regular basis from my illness too and when that happens my pain jumps to a 10 easily. 

If I could go back and tell 23 years old me to be more careful with the pain medications, I totally would, because then maybe 30 years old me wouldn't be in so much despair.

BODY: &gt; I never take it to get high and it only seems to help me be pain free but for only a few hours at a time, not ideal when I work long shifts.

Neither did I, yet somehow I ended up potentiating it and trying things to make it last longer &amp; stretch it out. Ultimately, it backfired and I ended up needing more than what was prescribed to me. Chronic pain is a rough road.

All I advise is that you stick to your script and don't look for ways to potentiate it. If it comes down to it, ask your doctor about the dose not being effective anymore and ask him for help. 

The second you take matters into your own hands is the moment you go from pain patient to addict.

TITLE: We're Scum &amp; Don't Deserve to Be Treated Well. Even in Recovery., POST BODY: The title is basically the vibe I got from my doctor's office this morning.  

I'm absolutely pissed off. 

I work 45minutes from where I live and I don't drive. So, I'm relliant on rides and Uber/Lyft usually I dont mind this. 

Except I accidentally left my Subutex this morning at home. 45 minutes away. Ugh. 

My first thought was good news, I fill my script week by week and pay out of pocket for it. I'll just call CVS and have them transfer the script over from the CVS 45 minutes away to the CVS down the block from me and be fine. 

CVS down the block was surprisingly helpful in this situation. The pharmacist apologized because subutex is schedule 3 they cant pull it from one CVS to another but my doctor could call it in and have a days worth of it filled electronically if they're FDA approved. 

So, I call my doctors office. I tell them what's up and the receptionist is more than nasty to me. 

I must've begged and pleaded with her for 10 minutes asking if anything could be done, if another doctor in the office could help. I asked her what her suggestion was. She told me to go to the ER or Urgent Care. I asked if that would get me kicked out of their office for filling with a different doctor. She told me that it probably would. 

Finally, I told her, "Look Dr. X Wants to keep me OUT of the ER and if I dont come up with a solution you're asking me to get fired. Over something that could be solved with a phone call to the CVS down the road. I would like to speak with Dr. X regarding this matter now." She told me he was with patients and I told her I would wait on hold till he had a break. 

She finally transferred me to his assistant.  I told her the same thing I told the receptionist. That I made a huge mistake, my bad, I accepted responsibility for it, but if she thought getting me fired over it when they had the power to solve the issue was an effective way to help someone rebuild their life and recover. Especially considering I'm not asking them to call in a months worth or a weeks worth. I'm asking them to call in 1days worth. 

I guess that did it because she had the doctor call the CVS down the road from me and I'll be picking it up on my lunch break. God willing. 

I cannot believe how much hassle that was. I'm floored by the treatment of that receptionist and I just think we all need to be treated with a little more respect. Ugh.

I just needed to vent. Thanks. Xo., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bwd5qf/were_scum_dont_deserve_to_be_treated_well_even_in/

Somehow, though I took them out over the weekend and forgot to put them back.

Also, to be clear I don't think my job would fire me over something like this. Especially because I would've just told them it was a doctors error and whatnot. I did get an hour and a half lunch starting 30 minutes early because I had to pick up from the pharmacy 15 minutes away as well as eat. So it's not like my workplace is unreasonable.

It was my private doctors office that sees me as a chronic pain patient through my private insurance and works alongside 4 of my other specialists to ensure that my care is handled correctly. I'm also paying $250 a visit out of pocket for this particular specialist along with the cost of my medication outside of insurance, so, yea - I expected more from them. 

If it were a clinic with strict rules for everyone and/or if I had a spotty record or something - I'd understand but I was asking for a call in for 1 pill for 1 dose.

Plus, I last had this script filled 45 days ago and saw my Dr. last week. I just hadn't refilled because the 30-day script was lasting me closer to 50 days... Also, I pay this doctor $250 a visit out of pocket, he's private, works with 4 other specialists on my case specifically, and is not your typical suboxone clinic, it's more of a rare case/pain specialty office.

I came into the ER with the bolts in my neck loose, it was already confirmed by my surgeon and I was on the schedule to be in surgery the next day. I was blunt and upfront with the ER doctor about my addiction, diagnosis, and the level of pain I was in. He proceeded to withhold medication, insist my doctor was wrong, tell me I wasn't on the surgery list and he'd prove it in the morning when he would be kind enough to call my surgeon as to not wake him at 2am. I said fine, and sure enough he looked like a fine fool at 9am when I was getting pain medication, finally because he decided to act like a tool.

For the receptionist to knowingly suggest something that would ultimately get me kicked out of the office is just pure malice.

If the doctor/office thought I'd be fine for the day that's for the doctor himself to let me know. Not the receptionist denying any contact whatsoever.

You're not wrong, about normal instructions for subutex. Unfortunately, Subutex has a very strange effect on me. 

I get exceptionally sleepy. Sleepy like you have narcolepsy, sleepy. 

So we dull the effect of it on purpose. I take 2mg 2x/day at 9am and 8-9pm. Also the only thing I do before 9am is brush my teeth, I leave for work around 7:45am and get there at 9am, I usually have cereal from the kitchen at work and don't eat at home.

That is besides the point though 1-2mg is a low as we can get so we dull the effect by taking it on an off schedule. It has a dual effect, I'll go into W/ds after about 13 hrs without a dose but the flip side is won't be a zombie for the entire day.

Also to address this:

&gt;Speaking of which ... Now that you got a days worth called in for you should have extra now to keep hidden at work.

Yeah 100% I plan to keep some in my locked desk at work. I believe I already stated that around here in another post earlier, but yea, live and learn. Doesn't mean I can't be upset about poor treatment.

Dunno what came of it, they mailed me a few times ensuring me they were taking it seriously and investigating the matter. Eventually, I got a letter saying they decided there was no foul, which, I of course expected, but I imagine that doctor thought twice about things overall. I'm sure he was at least questioned.

She put up a fight until I told her this could get me fired. So I guess she empathized with that. It just was insane the way the receptionist was talking down to me.

BODY: It sounds exactly like you are dealing with severe depression. Of course, I'm not a psychiatrist so, I can't properly diagnose you, but I can say this:

For me, depression was a nasty enemy and hard to beat. It was hard because by nature depression makes it so you don't want to take action against it. That apathetic feeling is what makes depression linger on longer than necessary. You have to get outside of your head and put in work to make it go away and at first, that seems counter-intuitive but engaging in opposite to emotion action has proven to be one of the healthiest ways to combat depression. 

For instance, if you feel like isolating, FORCE yourself to reach out to a friend and break the ice. If you don't want to shower or make your bed, DO IT ANYWAY, it'll help you feel better about yourself and bonus points because self-care is another way to defeat depression.

Concepts like forgiveness, radical acceptance, and CBT/DBT skills are all useful if you take action and Google them. Those are also specific things you can work on in therapy too - if you do that sort of thing.

Anyway, that's just a few ways to get a bit better. Patience is a virtue with depression because change comes about microscopically and slowly, but you will have your small victories and that's worth celebrating.

You're not going to like this answer because it's the nature of your bipolar to want a quick fix to your mental health but, it takes hard work to overcome mental illness like that.

I'm schizoaffective, but I'm high functioning to a point where people today think I was misdiagnosed.  I didn't get to that point overnight though. It took years of hard mental work. I had to use CBT and DBT to basically rewire my brain, then I used mindfullness to help ground me and learned to enjoy/stay in the moment. 

It was a full-fledged effort that took a lot of work, I worked out of workbooks for an entire year before I noticed any difference, but once I noticed that difference there was no denying that the progress was huge if not infinite.

So to be blantantly honest I'm prescribed an unorthodox mix of medications to prevent me from landing in the hospital all the time. It's dramatically improved the quality of my life and with NAs help I've been living an honest life. 

However, over the last 9 months - I've lost two sponsors. One dumped me because she was uncomfortable with my medication regime and the other dropped me because I called her out on putting pressure on her sponsees to cook for an event with less than 24hrs notice. 

I'm not going to get into many details here about what's happened with sponsors. I will say though I want to find the right sponsor. I just don't know how to go about that and may be willing to look at a long distance sponsorship with someone online because I'm not sure I'm going to find what I need anywhere nearby.

EDIT BELOW 

I guess this is what's bugging me:

All the petty [drama with my now ex-sponsor](https://old.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/c3yx3e/drama_alert/) was put into really good perspective when Monday rolled around. I woke up at 6am very sick. Very, very, very, sick. I got up, went to the restroom and the vomiting started. For 30 minutes, I kept heaving up everything till it was just bile and dry heaving. I went to the ER and was there from 7am - 10am. They got it all under control and I went home.

Or so I thought. 

I was lethargic all day long and just unable to do much - if anything at all. So, TV it was. Until 6pm when the vomiting started up again. This went on for an hour before I was so crippled over the toilet, unable to stop hurting, sweating, and throwing up. I called 911 because I was in a state of uncontrollable vomiting and I know that state, it can take hours to get rid of and like hell I'm going to be throwing up in my Fiance's car ruining it.

However when the paramedics showed up their suggestion was to take some Zofran &amp; sleep it off. I briefly described my illness so they took my blood pressure which was somewhat normal. So, they told me they could transport me or they could not. I went back and forth, and finally was convinced going with the paramedics was an expensive endeavor and if they could give me a vomit bag for the drive to the hospital - I'd go with my Fiance. 

So ER trip #2 it was. I got there around 9pm and was there till 1am. They soothed everything and while I knew I likely needed an admission or could've used one to sleep this off, I left because I want to keep my job. note: If you're still reading this....thank you for caring. I got up at 6am on Tuesday and went to work.

On Thursday the exhaustion caught up with me and I had to leave work in the middle of the day. &amp; now here we are on Sunday and I'm nauseous as fuck and very anxious that it's gonna start up again. I also am in more pain than I can bear and can't take any oxycodone for another 6-8hrs at least for it to be effective.

I'm on subutex. But, I'm also prescribed a small quantity of oral oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Thing is nights like these I have to wait 16-36 hrs before it'll work for me so in the meantime, I just sorta need to ride it out. 

IDK why I'm sharing. I guess I want to distract myself. &amp; Thanks for listening!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/c7b1st/chit_chat_with_me/

TITLE: I Need to Lose Weight..., POST BODY: Whelp, between all my physical health struggles and ever since my feeding tube was removed - I've gained 70lbs in 2 years making me 70lbs overweight. It's disgusting. It's disturbing to me. 

I really don't think I eat a whole heck of a lot seeing as I'm nauseated most days. I eat in small increments, my stomach can't handle more. I've been throughly elevated and aside from a minor autoimmune disorder and my existing pancreatic condition there is no good reason for me to be gaining all this weight. Luckily I've plateaued  at my current weight and I fluctuate 8-10 pounds from morning to night. 

I know this isn't really opiate related, but you guys are my fam and I'm in need of serious help. I don't even know where to start diet wise. So, I've been thinking of ways I could try to get exercise. However when it takes a whole hour to burn 250 calories - that's pretty discouraging for me. 

Anyway, any encouragement, advice or spot to start would be amazing. I'm thinking of buying a swim cap/googles and going swimming at my friend's condo. She lives a mile from me, I could walk there swim for 30-60 minutes and then walk back home. We've talked about doing this regularly after work. Then on days I'm not swimming I could potentially work on a couch to 5K program.

As for food, I'm just so lost. I can't eat a lot of fat or veggies because of my digestive system. Fruits work as does carbohydrates. The problem with that is that's a really high sugar diet. My GP prescribed me Adderall and said it might help. I haven't filled the script because it concerns me to take something else that I could potentially get addicted to.

BODY: Honestly, you probably should take the last Xanax the night before your appointment. That's going to be your safest bet. Years ago I would buy oxycodone off the street. I'd take it for 3 weeks then stay off for the last week in case I was UA'd. I needed the UA to be clean.

Alternatively, when I was prescribed I'd run out of my script real quick (like in 3 weeks) I'd always save at least ONE for my UA. I actually would try to save 3 so I'd only be miserable for 4 days instead of 7, but still. Took a lot of self control to do 

Eventually I just lost all self control and ended up going cold turkey. Today I am on Subutex so I've had a long journey. I was going somewhere with this, but I can't remember where.

Exactly. Normally I'd suggest honesty, but honesty can lead to consequences of being cut off. Which, would suck.

&gt;ask a friend who I know eats Xanax like crazy and just have them pee for them and go from there. I DONT KNOW :(.

B-A-D idea. You have no idea what else they have in their system AND if you're caught you can kiss addictive scripts goodbye forever.

&gt;Also Subutex, do you still take it?!

Yes. I actually got completely clean and then started on 2mgs of SUBUTEX 3x/daily. It's not SUBOXONE. Suboxone has naltrexone in it. 

Whereas Subutex is pure buprenorphine.  For some reason, I react strangely to naltrexone like its caused seizures in the past. 

Also, I have a physical pain issue so my doctor felt not blocking out opiates was a good idea. I need to be able to use narcotics during an emergency. Which means he also scripts me 15mg of oxycodone. I get 15 pills for the month. I use them when I flare. It's been really helpful &amp; I've been able to control my usage well.

Anyway, I got on it when I brought my doctor a detailed history of my opiate abuse. He referred me to this particular Subutex doctor that rarely takes on new patients. So, I was lucky getting in to see him. If I didn't have the referral - I'd be SOL.

BODY: I've had a few toxic relationships in NA over the past year. I started attending in June of 2018. I'm only clean for 9 months right now though. I relapsed, but to be honest, looking back I should've just kept my original clean time. I like the sense of fellowship and I've made two good friends out of it. However, I've also had two really bad experiences.

My first sponsor dropped me out of the blue with no explanation. I was thinking it was because I didn't call her for two days. Well, turns out she actually dropped me because she didn't agree with the way my medical team was handling my care and felt I'd never be truly clean. It was really emotional on me and I still can't go to the meeting she goes to regularly because I get far too angry in it.

My next sponsor was temporary and she dropped me over superficial bullshit. She changed a  casual get together into a formal affair 24hrs before the event and insisted everyone cook for it. She randomly assigned me to bring and cook veggies. When a sponsee sister asked why she made the change and that she was confused by it, my sponsor said it was a women's prerogative. I called her out for being rude and would think that at that moment as a sponsor she could've pulled me into a private chat and simply asked, "why do you feel that way?" Instead, she lashed out, became incredibly defensive, uninvited me from the event and finally dropped me as a sponsee.

You can check if your [eligible here](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/eligibility-check) (requires your last name and last 6 social security number digits) &amp; you can file a claim by clicking the file claim button on [this page](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/). My entire immediate family was affected. We all selected the pre-paid card option and will hopefully get a little extra money long after we've forgotten we even submitted this form. Which, is always nice IMHO.

# Now things to note:

1. This website is **LEGITIMATE** it is linked to from this [FTC GOVERNMENT SITE](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement).
2. If you want you can claim up to 10 hours of work on this without any proof of it. That means you can get $375 instead of $125, *but that might be murky water*. I personally just signed up for the $125 option.
3. If you select the $125 option - you also need to get credit monitoring for 6 months - ***essentially, what I'm saying is read the site carefully.***
4. You may get less money depending on how many people join the class action suit
5. There''s always a chance the class action is unsuccessful and everyone gets nothing. IANAL disclaimer, but I personally think that's unlikely.
6. If you live outside of the USA and were NOT affected and cannot collect, *don't be sad*, just know your social security number and/or **private details aren't compromised and that's a lot better.**

# What is the Equifax Data Breach &amp; Settlement?

&gt;Credit reporting agency Equifax has reached a deal to pay up to $700 million to state and federal regulators to settle probes stemming from a data breach that [exposed the personal information](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/26/investing/equifax-ceo-richard-smith-out/index.html) of nearly 150 million people.

That's the worst of it, you're going to screw up your ability to be able to get regular pain management during flares. 

Your doctors will no longer allow you to have any narcotic medication during a flare. Just the thought of how much I've fucked myself over turns my blood cold. 

25-year-old me you still have a chance. Yes, you're going to face spinal surgery and a bit of depression afterwards while you live at home. There are going to be good things though. You'll meet your future husband, and you'll eventually get off the drugs, but you have a chance today to stop right now and just experience the good things life has to offer and not the hell of addiction.

If you don't stop now ... It wont be easy. It'll all be difficult in a way. At the end of the day you will have wished that you rejected that pain pill script in the name of pain management because addiction is a beast and it doesn't care why you need the pills. **It ruins you regardless.**

BODY: I used to think I was very emotional on opiates. Turns out that was just the surface of things. When I quit taking them, even missing my morning coffee or something would cause me to cry. Since then, I've balanced out a whole lot, but I do know I feel things more now that I'm no longer on full antagonistic opiates. It's all very strange and emotionally draining.

BODY: &gt;The last time I needed I/V in hospital I had it put in my neck with staples to hold it in place whilst under general anaesthetic.

They have to ultrasound me for a vein, use my foot, the sensitive part of my wrist or simply have had to put me under to get a central line. I've been poked upwards of 20 times to get an IV line before they got a small one, put me under and did a central line. It was all very scary fucking stuff. Now when I go in and need an IV, I tell my nurse to hit my wrist, feet, or get an ultrasound. They always insist at looking first and  usually can't get anything other than what I recommended. The other week I had one on the side of my hand below the pinky finger. That was epic.

TITLE: &amp; on the 297th day of my recovery..., POST BODY: I'm so excited. Today I am 297 days clean and I was able to get my expensive [Tiffany Diamond Necklace](http://imgur.com/a/aMu28om) out of pawn. I traded it for $250 worth of roxies 2 years ago. 

&amp; speaking of finances, I'm doing the best I ever could be. I have a lot of money out in loans to friends and family that I haven't been able to keep under control. 

Each month I would be left with $50 to myself after all my bills were paid.  It was miserable. I felt like I was being cheated financially in my recovery. So, earlier this week I applied for a bank loan. 

With that I've paid everyone off. I've separated myself financially speaking from my father. He still agreed to help me with medical costs but everything else is my responsibility.  It's a big deal because I was very dependent on my parents. 

Throughout my college years, illness and all of my 20s my father fully supported me. from housing costs to groceries he's been more than generous with me. I could not be more grateful to him.

Plus, I am finally well enough to be working. I've been at this job for 6 months and it is the best. It feels really good to finally be a real adult with quality problems. 

I'm really starting to be excited for my future.  The next step is to get another piece of jewelry out of pawn. That item is $450 to retrieve. 

Then, I'm going to focus on my upcoming wedding in 2020 and now I've started rambling so I'll stop here

TITLE: I appreciate the kind souls on a day that was utterly miserable 4 years ago., POST BODY: I remember that day so well. I'd been to 7 pharmacies that day trying to find a place that would fill an opioid script for me. I was suffering with tons of pain at the time and the pharmacist's reaction at 6 different pharmacy's were, "you've never been scripted this medication in this state so we can't give it to you!" 7th one was the charm though.

The guy who took my script was able to call up the bordering state to find out if I had anything suspicious on my record. Of course,  I did not and he was able to fill the script for me. I was so grateful to him. My script becomes available. I have 37.41 in my bank account and the price of the medication was: 37.41.

I could afford it - I would get paid 2 days later - and an older woman comes by and tells me "you shouldn't have $0" and hands me a $20. I was about to insist she keep it, but something else came of it. I decided to keep it. It's a good thing I did too because just as I was walking out of the store my phone was dying.

I travel by uber &amp; lyft so no phone = no getting home.

I used that $20 to buy myself a cheap charger and I used the remainder to buy a bit of food for the house.

TITLE: Honoring My Cousin's Memory - 5 Years Ago Today., POST BODY: Hi Reddit. For those that don't know me my name is Dori. I joined [r/opiates](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/) eight years ago. I am definitely an addict and have dealt with many struggles. Today I am cleaned up and we'll get there. For right now though this is about my cousin's and her memory.

I'll never forget 5 years ago today. I was away from home, shooting my prescription opiates through my feeding tube and lounging on the couch because, that's what I did every single day. That morning I had posted to my cousins Facebook page with a picture of Kristen Stuart. Apparently some stupid Facebook quiz told me that I looked like her and because my cousin and I looked a lot alike I tagged her in that post.

A few hours later, I'm on a skype call with my best friend. We've known each other since childhood. So, as we're chitchatting she asks, "Who is \[cousin\]?" &amp; I respond with "Oh, that's \[cousin\] she's amazing! We reconnected recently." She asks if I'd been to her facebook page recently and I tell her I was there that morning when I posted the Kristen Stuart photo and as I'm telling my best friend this I pull up my cousin's page because I know something was up.

I was not prepared for what I found.

I found condolences, RIP posts, and "is this a joke?!" posts all over my cousin's Facebook. Immediately, I freak out, I hang up on my best friend to make calls as my brain is trying to process this information. I want to call my aunt ASAP. I decide against it. I call up my dad who is overseas. It's the middle of the night for him and I leave a horrific voicemail of me freaking out. I call my mom who lived a state away and she tells me it's true &amp; she's 3 hours away from me. She was driving out to me to tell me the news in person.

That comforted me a lot despite finding out on Facebook of all things. It also helped that I was live with my best friend, because she's seen some shit with me and is an amazing person.

There's more to that day, but in the days following I had found out my cousin relapsed on heroin. In the months following we found out that she had died from a fentanyl overdose. My cousin struggled with heroin for most of her life. She died in her late-20s.

A few months before my cousin's death I was in my hometown and my cousin asked me if I wanted to support her and go to an NA meeting with her. I had declined. I thought it would be weird for me because I "needed" pain medication for my chronic pain. This is a decision I regret every single day.

My aunt had outlived her only two children. Her son had passed two years prior to a diabetes complication. Seeing her pain motivated me to clean up my life. Today, I walk the exact same rooms of narcotics anonymous that my cousin walked in my original hometown.

I didn't get there right away though. It wasn't until three long years after my cousins death that I attended my first meeting. From there, I'd like to say the path to recovery was beautiful, but that's simply not the truth. I struggled and even after entering the rooms I had many setbacks, relapses, temper tantrums, &amp; caught many cases of the "fuckits." before my most recent relapse 57 days ago.

I'm coming up on 60 days clean and this time I'm hopeful it's going to stick, because for the first time ever the pain and misery of using has outweighed the temporary relief it gives me. Some recovering addicts in the rooms knew my cousin too. I've started to embrace that and now it has become a blessing for me because they have experience with someone who was genetically like me. They've guided me and help me immensely. I've been able to learn from my cousin and grow as a result.

That in my opinion is the best way to honor my cousin's memory.

I share this story with you all today, because even though it's horrific and sad, there's hope to it and I just hope that someone here gets something out of this story. I don't post often anymore, but I still lurk around and if no one has said it to you today, active addiction or not, let me tell you that I love you just the way you are., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/iz1uke/honoring_my_cousins_memory_5_years_ago_today/

TITLE: Happy 30th Birthday., POST BODY: I've tried writing this post 100 times. my younger brother would be turning 30 this year. Today is his birthday. I miss him so much. I always will. He died of a heroin overdose. For those of you who are in the game, know that you are loved. Even if it's by an internet stranger. I love you.

I feel like I oughta share a spooky story about my brother because of Halloween. A few months after my spine surgery, I decided to get clean in 2017. I white knuckled it and I was 3 days clean. I had moved home after surgery because it was a major surgery and there wasn't much I could do alone. This particular day my family was out of the house and I had this idea that I should have the house pone on me in case I needed it. Just to be safe.

I left my cell phone in the upstairs bedroom and started heading downstairs to grab the house phone. That's when it happened. 3 days clean and I somehow stumble on the steps. Time seemingly slowed down as i reached for the first thing to stabilize me - the handrail - I landed in a very strange position. My hand/arm was firmly on the handrail and I flung into a crazy backbend on the stairs. My head was inches from the step above and yet i didn't hit the group or even tumble. It was like something or someone was underneath me holding me up.

That moment was so impactful because I was 3 days clean and would have caused serious injury at best and died at worst due to the metal in my neck. I also would not have been able to call for help because there was no phone nearby. 

I gently lowered myself onto the middle steps of the staircase and started crying hysterically for what seemed like forever. It was like my brother was there, and went, "Oh fuck no. Not letting her die at 3 days clean. Fuck, fuck, FUCK that." I'm not a very religious, 'nor do I believe in the supernatural, but in that moment it was undeniable that it was no accident I landed the way I did.

Afterall, this incident occurred in the same house where my brother died. 

I still don't know  what to make of it, but I like to think my brother is my guardian angel in a lot of ways. Today I honor my brother's life by sharing my story(ies) about him even if it was from his afterlife., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/jh4an0/happy_30th_birthday/

That's exactly who it was written for. You. I can only encourage you to keep plugging along. My brother was plotting suicide, however, the day he died was not his intended day. He just stopped caring.

I encourage you to stay clean and find recovery. So long as you are alive, you have a chance. I did not stay clean after that day in 2017, I had many relapses. Today I am 86 days clean and I am more committed to my recovery than ever before. I've found the misery of using outweighs the temporary relief it gives.

I once was so high I fell asleep sitting on my feet. When I woke up both feet were numb. Guess what you can't do with two numb feet? That's right. WALK. Which is what I tried to do and promptly broke my left foot. Good god I'm glad I'm not doing shit like that anymore.

TITLE: LowKey Proud of Myself, POST BODY: I recently celebrated 90 days of clean time. Well, today my brain decided to fuck with me a whole bunch. My disease was talking to me: 

&gt;"Imagine how good the painkillers would work right now! You wouldn't need a lot! AND YOU HAVE MONEY TO GET THEM!!!"

So all day I've been telling that thought to come back later. Like a boomerang it kept circling back into my head. So INSTEAD of picking up I went ahead and texted a few people including my sponsor. Then, I started working on my step work when my sponsor texted back. We made a small plan for me to go for a walk, listen to music, come home, take a hot bath and have some ice cream after.

Of course, I don't ever listen 100% so I got dressed went outside and instead of listening to music I called her. I also decided not to do a hot bath or ice cream. Instead I decided to walk to 7/11 to get snacks. I ended up with Orange Juice, a PushPop, and Salt&amp;Vinegar Chips instead of dope.

Got home safe and sound, and am seriously lowkey proud of me right now., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/jn316l/lowkey_proud_of_myself/

TITLE: Doing Things Differently., POST BODY: This past week I was hospitalized for pancreatitis. I don't know how I did it without opiates, but I did. After lengthy discussions with my sponsor, doctors, and family we all decided low dose ketamine and a solid amount of Benadryl to sedate me throughout the process was the way to go. It sorta worked. I cannot believe I did it without the opiates or without benzos because that shit was very anxiety inducing. 

The problem is I'm in the aftermath of my hospitalization and beginning to process what I just went through. I keep playing the tape through and as a result my brain keeps trying to justify using. I'm even slightly annoyed with myself for not taking anything in the hospital because I keep telling myself, "you would've been justified!" I get the physical addiction, but holy shit the way opiates have hijacked my brain is incredible. Here I am with 110 days clean and all I want to do is use after fighting tooth and nail to NOT use.

TITLE: It's been 10 years..., POST BODY: I've been posting about my brother on r/opiates at the end of November for 8 years. This year is not any different. I want to bring awareness opioid addiction and how I've coped with it over the years.

You see, 10 years ago today my brother was in the last 24hours of his life. He died in the late night on November 29th, 2010. The last time I saw him alive was at Thanksgiving. The holidays are a rough time for myself and my family.  

Today, I am 122 days off drugs and doing much better, while I do miss my brother, I’m happy and I’m sharing my story, because I want to show others that, no matter how painful your situation is, you can and will get through it all. I honor my brother's memory by not using and working hard for my recovery. I overcame the hardest thing to ever happen to me. It’s all about perseverance and taking it one step at a time. It sound cliche but it is true that every moment is precious. 

Time doesn’t heal all wounds. It only allows you a chance to develop better coping mechanisms. Over the years my tools to handle the grief have improved dramatically despite the fact that my grief will always be incredibly painful., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k32dxu/its_been_10_years/

You let them do every single non-narcotic option first including things like spinal injections, other kinds of non-narcotic medication, physical therapy, perhaps even one or two invasive surgeries and then you can probably get the narcotic medication.

It's not worth it.

If you think it may be a result of mental illness I highly recommend using this [breathing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) to help conquer the anxiety you might be having. I know it sounds so silly to say, "just breathe through it," but you'd be surprised by how our emotions influence physical problems and exasperate them. So, if you're able to regulate your emotions a little bit better, it can alleviate physical ailments.

This time last year I had gotten off Suboxone and convinced my doctors to put me back on Oxycodone. From there, I decided to get off the oxycodone in early February and returned to recovery.

I didn't take it seriously though and I started cheating. Then on July 29th in a moment of clarity -- I guess -- I confessed to my therapist that I had been using on and off Between February and July. I had no intention of quitting. As far as I was concerned I was just going to chip and use opiates "for pain," and be fine. 

*'cuz everything is fiiinnnnneeeeee.* (meanwhile everything is on fire). 

Anyway, that didn't happen. 

I started doing things differently. I decided to take each and every suggestion that was made to me with the best of intentions. Not every suggestion was right for me, but eventually, I found a system that worked for me. 

I still haven't used since July 29th, 2020. I even had a hospitalization in the past 5 months for my pancreas and didn't use opiates whatsoever during that time. If you'd seen or know me from this subreddit 2 years ago, you know that this is all a dramatic change for me.

TITLE: The Obsession to Use is Strong, POST BODY: I'm definitely obsessed with using. To the point where my brain goes, *"don't take those antibiotics for your infection! Let it fester and you'll have a reason to accept drugs in the hospital when it gets really bad!"* Yeah. It's fucking terrifying being inside my brain sometimes. Anyway, the next thought was, *"Shut the fuck up, your guilt will consume you if you do that. If you're gonna go to those kinds of lengths it's easier to pick up on the streets."* So now here I am with all these ~~bright~~ stupid ideas, left thinking to myself, *"WTF is wrong with you. Sthap. Just take your fucking antibiotic and stop trying to think up ways to self destruct."*

BODY: I don't have a great answer but once I was withdrawing from 5mg of methadone and had no idea that it was withdrawals or what withdrawals were at the time. It was very traumatic and I ended up in a bathtub with my clothes on because I was in so much pain at like 7am my family called my psychiatrist who said to give me 10mg of oxycodone and that, that should help. I took the 10mg and sure enough it eased the pain a whole lot. I ended up not taking any more after that and was free of narcotics for about 8 months after that before ending up back on them.

I was so naive.

BODY: OP your delivery of your message fucking sucks even though I wholeheartedly agree. 

The problem is so much deeper and you've given a very simplified black and white view of the situation when there's a ton of grey area to be explored.

Personally, for me, I have found that by being able to build an emotional connection with my pain, practicing radical acceptance around it, practicing self care, and by recognizing the difference between acute and chronic pain, I've been able to thrive off of painkillers despite living in extreme levels of pain on a daily basis.

Here's the deal, doing the emotional sappy work that's required to beat chronic pain is so difficult, however, when you dig deep and become open to the possibility that you can live with your pain without painkillers and address emotional issues surround your physical pain, you can begin to heal and that healing that takes place lasts a lot longer than any opiate might.

There's a lot more to it than what I've described above, but that's the gist of it. I honestly don't feel like going into every bit about it but "A Day Without Pain," by Mel Pohl is an excellent book that explores this concept in full and I got a lot out of reading it.

BODY: There's a huge difference between acute pain and chronic pain.

Opioids are effective and should be used short term for acute pain.

Chronic pain is a different story, it requires a lot of cognitive behavioral therapy because the brain has been wired to be overly sensitive to pain. By changing the way you think about pain, you can actually change the way you feel about it and that ultimately can change your entire experience. It's just fucking hard to do and takes a long time to work, but the benefits outlast any opioid medication long term.

BODY: I'm glad to see you've made it to the otherside. Congratulations on 35 days. That's a huge deal. It's been nice seeing some of us OGs get cleaned up. I always thought I'd be a lifer too - until I wasn't. What was most fucking surprising was how much 12-Step has worked for me. I used to hate that shit. Now I love it.

&gt;My head takes me to dark fucked up places often but it's ok. It doesn't mean i have to act bad. 

This is exactly what I keep reminding myself of. Just because I think it, doesn't mean I have to act on it. If I acted on every single bad thought I had, I'd be a complete and utter mess and possibly in jail for something stupid af.

TITLE: This subreddit has changed, POST BODY: When I first joined r/opiates nearly 10years ago 98% of the time it was all about wild stories and pill porn. Also, does anyone remember that mugshot trend we had here 8 or so years ago?

Today it is very different. There’s no pill porn and certainly no one is posting their selfies as mugshots, today there’s a lot more talk about harm reduction and recovery. 

One thing hasn’t changed though everyone here is amazing. I’ve met some of the best people on this subreddit over the years. 

Just wanted to share.

EDIT: I was saying that the subreddit may have changed a whole lot but the people here always have and always will rock. Guess my original post didn’t get that message through clearly enough. Hahaha., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/mml1xo/this_subreddit_has_changed/

TITLE: Flip-Fucking Balls - I'm 9 Months Clean!, POST BODY: I am an opiate addict and I cannot believe it. This is the longest consecutive amount of clean time I've ever had. I'm really surprised I've made it this far. Especially because of my chronic pain and how I used to be. I was ALWAYS the victim. I hated the idea of NA and the only God that existed was junkie Jesus.

Today, I am empowered. I have found that NA works fantastically for me (go figure) and I am so damn lucky that I survived my addiction thus far because not everyone does. I’ve lost my brother and cousin to addiction and I’ve seen the devastating results of that.

I am proud to be a chronic pain patient in recovery from addiction.

At 8.5 months clean I was craving badly and it was looking like I wasn't going to make 9 months.

I was ready to cave. I was scheming and scamming and had a whole relapse plan that I intended to carry out. Somehow though, someway, I realized that if I put as much effort into scheming as I might my recovery, I might have a shot.

So, instead of scheming and scamming as per usual, I tried something different, stepped entirely outside of my comfort zone and moved into a sober living.

It made all the difference for me. I now have 9 amazing roommates and I love living here for the time being.

Asking for help 8.5 months in wasn't easy too. I knew without any kind of change though, I would relapse. I cannot help but be genuinely proud of myself right now for making it to 9 months.

So, now it's onto one year and beyond, one day at a time. I can do this., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/n0wnnd/flipfucking_balls_im_9_months_clean/
