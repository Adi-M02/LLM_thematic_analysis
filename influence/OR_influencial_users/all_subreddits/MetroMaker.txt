TITLE: They Let My Friend Die, POST BODY: I got a call from the house that my friend Rick was in trouble and that I better get there fast.  It was 1:30 PM and  I was at work, so I begged off and I drove ASAP. When I got there, they had  dumped him in his car to get him out of the house and no one had called 911. Rick's lips were blue and he was drooling a red froth from his mouth, like red foam.  I was a lineman and the company made everyone pass Red Cross First Aid, so I was trained to call 911 first and then start CPR.  The new CPR is two emergency breaths followed by 100 chest compressions fast and hard and repeat until help comes.  Rick is a big man so I had to  straddle his big belly to start CPR.  Rick starting breathing with that rattle breathe, but only three breaths / minute.  Finally Fire and Rescue comes and they asked me what he took, which was two 80s, a bar, a dub and half a bottle. They hit Rick with NARCAN and took him to hospital.  Rick died the next day.  The cops called me and asked questions, but I was at work and had an alibi.   I was taught not to hate and I know that hate is a serious sin, but I'll say here and now that I hate those scumbags at the house.  They sold to him, robbed him when he passed out and they dumped him in his car like he was a sack of garbage.  Take care of yourself and your friends., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8aqqde/they_let_my_friend_die/

TITLE: Tales from the Oil Joint, Post 1, POST BODY: I heard that you guys like stories.  I have a bunch of old school tales.  I will keep each post short.  So do your thing boys and girls and get ready.  Oh ‚Äì everything in these stories are complete lies and fabrications or fiction.  One or the other.  I think, maybe ;).

The Boss ‚Äì A Bad Mother
The boss of the house was Price.  Price was an old school N who was all about business.  He had rules and order to his house and he got his cut from EVERYTHING flowing through from steaks to pussy.  If you broke his rules, you were barred.  Simple as that.  Price‚Äôs house wasn‚Äôt a trap house.  It was more like a party house or a hang-out.  Old school we would call it an oil joint.  A place where you could buy or sell ANYTHING and either take it home or do it there.

Being white and from the suburbs, I liked the rules and order.  Price made sure that everyone was mostly treated fairly and as safe as possible considering the environment.  I could send my girl to the house without her being harassed or ripped-off.  It‚Äôs not that things never got out-of-hand, but mostly things ran smoothly.

Price rarely got beat.  The reason was the way Price handled himself.  If you messed with him, Price wouldn‚Äôt call or threaten you over the Internet.  He didn‚Äôt spray your house with women and children in it.  He didn‚Äôt get his boys.  He didn‚Äôt mess up your car.  Price took care of his business with his fists and boots.  People who fucked with Price were beaten ‚Äì severely, old school style.  Not bitch slapped, not fucked-up, not ass whupped -- beaten.  He would do it himself, alone, or maybe take a white guy along so that he wouldn‚Äôt kill the man.  Price would break noses, blacken eyes and knockout teeth with one punch.  He would take out a knee or break an arm if he was in a bad mood.  Price didn‚Äôt need a weapon.  His rock-hard body was a weapon.  His hands were like grizzly paws.  He was a ferocious fighter, he was mean and he liked to fight.  One time he beat a man that he ran into in Walmart, right then and there, in front of his wife and kids.  Price was known for hurting men and that meant that few tried him and those that did regretted it.

TITLE: Tales from the Oil Joint, Post 2 LEPRECHAUN, POST BODY: The Oil Joint had no end of characters and one of the worst was Leprechaun or just Lep. Your first question is ‚ÄúDid he look like a leprechaun?‚Äù and the answer is YES. He stood about 5‚Äô6‚Äù, so he was short and stocky. He bathed infrequently, and he wore the same stinky overalls day after day, occasionally changing his T\-shirt.  Like a leprechaun, Lep had a scraggly red beard, a holdover from slave days. Most importantly, Lep loved gold in whatever form and HE WAS EVIL. He had absolutely no remorse and would chalk up his evilness to ‚ÄúTHE GAME‚Äù.

Lep had just been released from prison after serving 30\+ years for murder. I didn‚Äôt ask the particulars; I didn‚Äôt want to know. Consequently, Lep had that hair\-trigger temper that men develop in prison. A joke instantly became an attack on his manhood and you felt that violence was simmering just below the surface, ready to explode. Worse still, Lep always had a weapon. His favorite was a knife, but he had no qualms about smashing your face with a bottle or whatever else was handy. He also had an old piece of shit 25 auto from Charter Arms or Raven Arms or one of those bottom tier gun makers. The thing would jam every third shot and was just as likely to hurt the shooter as the shootee.  Webster should show a picture of Lep‚Äôs gun in their listing for Saturday Night Special. And to top it all off, Lep was the most racist man that I‚Äôve ever met. He hated all white people just because they were white.

A leprechaun must have his pot of gold and Lep‚Äôs gold was crack. Disregarding quality, Lep was an awesome dealer. For example, he would deliver 24x7, he was on\-time and his bags were heavy. The quality was crap, but he would use coca cola to ‚Äúbrown‚Äù his crack and vinegar to ‚Äúsmell‚Äù his H.  Lep‚Äôs dirtiest trick was to give\-out samples of the good stuff and once the customer was on a run and desperate for a hit, Lep would sell them the crappy stuff. It was all part of THE GAME., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/8fw50y/tales_from_the_oil_joint_post_2_leprechaun/

So whodunit?¬† Who killed Ronnie?¬† Some people would say that Ronnie killed himself, which at the lowest level, is true.¬† Some would say that the drugs killed Ronnie and that's true too.¬† A lot of people would say that the doctors killed Ronnie by withholding the painkillers and even more people would blame the Government.¬† Or maybe we killed Ronnie by abusing these very powerful medicines that should only be used for terminal diseases.¬† Who do you think killed Ronnie?¬†

I know a dBoy who just doesn't give a damn that he's selling car fentanyl mix that has killed four young guys so far. One boy died from sniffing a regular dope line, not coke rails. dBoy says that it's not his problem and that those boys, who were all experienced, just did too much, which is NOT TRUE.  When I saw that boys moms weeping at the funerals, it was devastating. If I was a real man, I would beat him, but he'd just hire a big person to come back at me. I don't want to tell on him, but I feel like I have to do something. Anyone have any ideas. And oh, this is NOT A WOWZY.

TITLE: dBoys with Blood on their Hands - the Decision, POST BODY: I've thought long and hard about the dBoy selling deadly fentanyl mix. First, I want to say "WOWZY, what a ride!" I have been called every name in the book.  Some people want me to go to the cops, some people want me to hurt him and some people want me to mind my own business.  Anyway, this is it. First, I want to talk with dBoy. I'm not going to threathen him with cops or pain. I just want him to reconsider what he has done. I might bring our old head, Hippie, with me as peacemaker. Second, I am offering free fent strips to friends and acquaintances. Like someone said, even if I save one life, it's worth it.  All the options had pros and cons. I think this option is the least drama and the least damage to everyone.  If there is an option that we haven't considered, I want to hear it.

TITLE: Repost Lep, POST BODY: U/freern313 asked me to repost this. Everyone seems in a good mood tonight, so..

The Oil Joint had no end of characters and one of the worst was Leprechaun or just Lep. Your first question is ‚ÄúDid he look like a leprechaun?‚Äù and the answer is YES. He stood about 5‚Äô6‚Äù, so he was short and stocky. He bathed infrequently, and he wore the same stinky overalls day after day, occasionally changing his T\-shirt.  Like a leprechaun, Lep had a scraggly red beard, a holdover from slave days. Most importantly, Lep loved gold in whatever form and HE WAS EVIL. He had absolutely no remorse and would chalk up his evilness to ‚ÄúTHE GAME‚Äù.

Lep had just been released from prison after serving 30\+ years for murder. I didn‚Äôt ask the particulars; I didn‚Äôt want to know. Consequently, Lep had that hair\-trigger temper that men develop in prison. A joke instantly became an attack on his manhood and you felt that violence was simmering just below the surface, ready to explode. Worse still, Lep always had a weapon. His favorite was a knife, but he had no qualms about smashing your face with a bottle or whatever else was handy. He also had an old piece of shit 25 auto from Charter Arms or Raven Arms or one of those bottom tier gun makers. The thing would jam every third shot and was just as likely to hurt the shooter as the shootee.  Webster should show a picture of Lep‚Äôs gun in their listing for Saturday Night Special. And to top it all off, Lep was the most racist man that I‚Äôve ever met. He hated all white people just because they were white.

A leprechaun must have his pot of gold and Lep‚Äôs gold was crack. Disregarding quality, Lep was an awesome dealer. For example, he would deliver 24x7, he was on\-time and his bags were heavy. The quality was crap, but he would use coca cola to ‚Äúbrown‚Äù his crack and vinegar to ‚Äúsmell‚Äù his H.  Lep‚Äôs dirtiest trick was to give\-out samples of the good stuff and once the customer was on a run and desperate for a hit, Lep would sell them the crappy stuff. It was all part of THE GAME., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/93k35l/repost_lep/

Yep - my 8 was in the refill bottle and fortunately I had enough control still to NOT go back to the pharmacy and ask for my 8 back.

TITLE: Are We Selfish?, POST BODY: Today's question is : are we selfish? I'll start.

Addicts are no more selfish than normal people. In fact, the situation sometimes demands selfishness.

For example, your acquaintance asks to share your dub, which barely has two shots and you need one for your wake up. If you share, you won't be able to get to work in the morning and so miss a day's pay and perhaps get fired.

You see, it's not like sharing half your sandwich at lunch time. In fact, addicts frequently share food, drnks, clothing and blankets even though we will go hungry or cold.

So my answer is addicts are LESS SELFISH. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/98c8ap/are_we_selfish/

I had no place to go after my slut wife got me arrested and kicked-out of my  house that I owned before the marriage. She lied to the cops and judges and got me on domestic violence. 

Anyhow, after I did my time, the only person who would take me in was the dBoy. I could have lived with family, but  they were not in the city where I was working. 

 I was like a fatboy in a free candy store. Not only did dBoy give fronts, but I was mentally sick over what my loving bitch wife did to me.

Finally dBoy presented me with a $1500 bill for dope and another $600 for rent while I was sleeping on his floor. dBoy let me pay on time, so my highest amount was $1500 and I paid it off.

TITLE: Fun with Church Girl and Adderall, POST BODY: We've had a lot of shit posts lately and I want to lighten things up a bit. So here is my latest escapade with Church Girl. 

I had $6.49 in my bank account and my Netflix payment would be hitting my account at midnight, so I had to get some money to my bank.  Otherwise, I'd get a $35 overdraft charge and Netflix would be shutoff. 

 Church Girl and I had a good time on Sunday (no we didn't fuck you pervs) and I even sprung for breakfast, so maybe she would help. I called her and asked for a ride to the bank and she said yes. When we got to the bank, I had to borrow $10 and she bitched at me "where is all your money going", but she coughed up the cash.

Now here is where it gets crazy. Church Girl is getting $10 from her bag and a bottle of pills fell out. I picked it up and read ADDERALL. OMG Church Girl is a speed freak. WTF?

I played dumb and asked her about her medication. She said that  "the doctor gave her these pills and they helped her at work to be focused and more productive". I almost cracked-up, but I wanted to see now stupid and naive and ignorant she was, so I didn't say "damn girl, you're a speed addict".

I told her that I wanted to be focused and more productive too and could I have some pills. She said that I had to ask my doctor, but she gave me ONE 20mg Adderall. I took that one pill this morning on an empty stomach and washed it down with strong coffee.

Now I have no tolerance to speed, so I was ZOOMING all day at work and people were starting to notice!

So there you have it. Church Girl is a speed freak and she doesn't even know it!!! , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/9f1zfr/fun_with_church_girl_and_adderall/

I loaded up and started the washing machine. I settled in and decided to take another line. I reached in my pocket to get my girl and it was not there. I searched around for a minute and then it hit me - I had changed my pants and my coke was in the laundry. Oh no. I scrambled to the washing machine, but it was too late.

I called my "friends" and luckily one guy said he'd drive me for $20. The guy's street handle is TOBOR. Don't ask me why. So I call dBoy and told him I was on my way. dBoy has this bright idea that we could pick-up another one of his customers to ride with us. I ask Tobar and he says OK.

Tobar sees that the other customer, Gary, is a complete sketch. Tobar tells Gary to leave his works at home because he doesn't want fixing in his car. Gary puts his works back and off we go.

On the way home, Tobar stops at 7-11 and he and I go in to get drinks and cigs. We come out to the car and DAMN Gary is fixing  in the car right in the. 7-11 parking lot.

Tobar is pissed and he's like "Fool you couldn't wait to get home. I told you to leave that shit at home!". Gary said "I am sick", but really he wasn't that sick. He just could not wait 20 minutes to get high. Tobar wanted to kick Gary out, but I talked him down and off we went.

TITLE: RIPPED OFF AGAIN or An Honest Man Doesn't Stand a Chance, POST BODY: I got ripped off again tonight.  Here's the story. I called dBoy but he couldn't deliver because his truck had a flat tire. I was about to get a zip car, but he said said Robert could deliver since he was coming right past my house on his way home from dBoy.  I said OK and Robert delivered. When I went inside, I saw that Robert had pinched half the bag. To add insult to injury Robert wanted gas money.

I always treat everyone fairly and with honesty and respect. In any other business, these qualities are virtues, but in this Game, they are weaknesses. And the worst thieves are chicks, old guys and cripples because they KNOW that I can't hurt them for ripping me.

TITLE: Landlady: WE HAVE AN ISSUE., POST BODY: I rent the basement of a senior lady 's home. It's ok. I have my own entrance and bathroom, so I have privacy and the rent is cheap.

I had ordered from the dark web and was expecting a package. One day, I was out the door to work when Mrs. Landlady called down to me: " Metro do you a couple minutes? We have an ISSUE".

My heart skipped a beat. I was sure that I was in big  trouble over the dark web order and I was going to be evicted or arrested or both. I walked up the basement stairs like a condemned man climbing the gallows. Lord, I was terrified.

It seemed like an hour, but I finally got to the top of the steps and asked her "What's the issue?"  She answered,  "There is a MOUSE in the house and I am scared. Can you please get it?". RELIEF washed over me. I was JOYFUL. It felt so so damn good. Thank you JJ or Allah or Mohammad or Buddha or Hari Kristna.

My mouse was caught in an old spring mouse trap  by only its tail. It was squeaking like crazy and trying to drag the mouse trap to escape. Actually, he was kinda cute and I might have kept him as a pet in a different scenario. I threw him, trap and alloutside and off I went to work. 

What are your RELIEF STORIES?

TITLE: Church Girl The Tease, POST BODY: Last week Church Girl called and asked me if I wanted to come over and see her new puppy.  Everyone likes new puppies so sure. So. Church Girl picks me up after work and we head over to her apt.

She opens the door and the puppy comes rushing out. Unfortunately, the puppy is only half house broken so her apt smelled, but that was too be expected. I didn't say anything because I didn't want her cleaning while I was visiting.

The puppy was an American bulldog about 8 weeks old and very cute.  I didn't know this,, but bulldogs have been so genetically engineered that they can't even mate w/o human help. The male's legs are so short that he can't mount the female on his own. That's kinda messed up, but onto my mounting.

I was playing with the puppy and Church Girl went into her bedroom.  From the bedroom, She said to me "It feels so good to get out of work clothes after a long day" and she comes out in just bra and panties.  Remember, that we haven't been intimate.

I'm trying to be Joe Cool, but damn any almost- naked woman at her peak of sexual attraction is just wonderful. So I am futilely trying to look without looking.  She goes into the kitchen and asks me if I am hungry and she'll make me some pasta or something. (What is it with Italian girls and feeding a man?).

I was just about to make my move when she says "I clean and cook and I know how to take care of a man. See what a good wife would be?"  and then she brings up my GF and how I have to leave my GF for her.

I played with the puppy a little more and said I was tired and went home,thinking "I am such a loser. A beautiful woman just put it in my face and I couldn't lie to her and tell her that I would leave my GF for her."  So here I am, just another loser,, sleeping all alone.

TITLE: Why is the husband called a stag and the other man called a bull?, POST BODY: I'm interested in the terminology. The stag deer is the master of the forest. Think Bambis dad. He can race through the forest with ease - try running in the forest. He routinely outwits the best hunter on the planet - me. He is graceful, strong, powerful but silent. Stags routinely fight to the death during rut.

Bulls, on the other hand, are smelly, lazy fat fucks - bullies. They push each other around, but they don't fight to the death. Heck they aren't even hurt.  They sometimes need a 2x4 between the eyes to remind them who's boss.

A stag is a much better animal than a dirty, stinking bull. , PERMALINK: /r/Hotwife/comments/9r8wym/why_is_the_husband_called_a_stag_and_the_other/

TITLE: Church Girl - So Close, POST BODY: I was down and out yesterday, but fortunately I scheduled a vacation day, so at least I was Ok with  work and it felt good to sleep-in.

At lunch time, I texted Church Girl and told her that I was home.  Coincidentally, she was home from work also and she asked me to come over because she was down in the dumps too. 

It was a beautiful Autumn day. You know the type - bright sunshine and a little nip in the air. We walked her dogs and came upon a farmers market. We bought fresh fruit and vegetables and cakes. We got back to her apartment and she offered to cook dinner. I said NO. because she was feeling down and I offered to take her out to eat. She picked the place, Roy Roger's, which was  thoughtful of my money. 

We watched TV and she sat next to me and after a while, she snuggled up to me and it felt good and right and so so nice and I knew that she had to be feeling the vibe.  She told me that she "really, really" (her words) liked me.  An hour or so later she said that she was sleepy and - here it comes - she asked me if I wanted to stay over and instantly - BOING - little jimmy was standing at attention.  Stay with me now. 

Church Girl went back into her bedroom and bathroom. I knew that girls like to "freshen up" beforehand. She came out and gave me a new tooth brush and a towel and wash clothe so I could "freshen up" too.  So this is IT, I am thinking, game on! 

And then, SHE STARTS TO MAKE-UP THE COUCH with a sheet and blanket and asked me if I like feather pillows.  NOOOOO NOOOO NOOOO. 

Then she fuc.. I mean tucked me in (her words) with a sweet and delicious FRENCH KISS. And that's it - a super sexy kiss and blue balls like I've never had before.  I left early in the morning and went to work.

Why me? Any other guy would have been balls deep, but not me. What a fucking loser and I am more depressed than ever. 

PS: This isn't an opiate story, but I thought you guys would like it anyway.

TITLE: Church Girl - Our First Big Fight, POST BODY: Two weeks ago, Church Girl asked to borrow $60 and disregarding everyone's advice I lent it to her. Now I work and so sixty bucks is no big deal, but like the man said up here - when you're broke and sick $20 is a fortune, or something like that.

Anyway, I give her the money and she promises to repay me as soon as her check clears, which should be 2-3 days. After five days,, I politely ask about the money. She says that she had to go to her credit union, which is about a 30 minute drive, to get my money. Again, no biggie and I ask her to go to the credit union in the next few days, but still, my spidey sense was tingling. Something was not right. 

Another 5 days pass and I ask again about my money,but she keeps giving me one excuse after another. Now one thing I learned from this GAME of ours is that I know when I am getting the RUN-AROUND AND CHURCH GIRL WAS GIVING IT TO ME! UNBELIEVABLE! 

Finally, she breaks down and admits that there was no check and she won't have my money until her next payday. I text her "Forget it. Keep the money, just leave me alone." She texts me "Quit being childish." I tell her goodbye and hang up. 

So tonight, 3 days later, she texts me and asks if I am still mad at her and she tells she will have my money tomorrow.  I calmed down by now and sixty bucks is still sixty bucks,, so I tell her "Great. See you at lunchtime." Then she tells me that she had to cancel her meal delivery service (I forget the company) and implied that I was taking her food money, putting the guilt trip on me. 

What I tried to explain to her was that I wasn't so much mad as DISAPPOINTED. I had thought "Finally here's a nice girl that I can trust", but. I was wrong - AGAIN. 

So my dear Opiates fam, do you think that I should renew our friendship or should I let it go.? What do you think?

TITLE: Metro How I Lost Everything to Love, Part 2, POST BODY:  If you can‚Äôt tell by now, I was so in love with my wife that I would have done anything for her. Max out my credit cards, write bad checks, take payday loans, rob a bank, anything for my bride. However, there were signs that not everything was kosher, but you know, love is blind.

For example, she would have extreme mood swings. One day she was sucking my rod and next she was throwing pots at me. And then there was the cocaine and crack. I never really liked the stuff as I‚Äôm a downer guy, but she could not get enough of it. Of course, I had to rescue her when she was in trouble with the dBoy. The worst was the verbal, psychological and emotional abuse. She would say the most cruel and hurtful things and then try to turn it around like it was all my fault, which is the biggest sign of a psychopath - GASLIGHTING. She did not physically abuse me, probably because she‚Äôs five-one and 105 pounds and I‚Äôm almost twice that, but I could see the rage in her eyes and it was frightening. I guess it‚Äôs my fault as I did not live with her before we were married and weekend sleepovers are just not sufficient to really KNOW someone. Everything is 20-20 in hindsight.

Then there was my social life. Before I was married, every weekend there would be a party at my house. I had 30 friends that would pick me up from the airport, but slowly she drove them all away so it was just her and me. Even my best friend Clyde would not come to my home because he could not stomach the way she treated me. So I became sicker and lonelier and more depressed and I was in that dark, dark place.  If you've ever been there, you know what I am talking about.

All of these things took a toll on me and like the frog in the pot, I did not realize it until I was neck-deep in boiling water. I know that some of you-are going to say that I should have gotten help and you‚Äôd be right. However, the way I was raised men don‚Äôt ask for help and certainly don‚Äôt ask for help because they can‚Äôt control their wife. My health and work productivity began to decline, but I did not understand the relationship between stress and health and well-being. Now, we all know that they are closely intertwined, but back then, I was lost.

TITLE: Metro Gets Ripped off Again, POST BODY: I am just NOT cut out for this dope game. Here's an example. 

My "friend" Robert was making a run so I asked him to please pick me up on the way to the trap. 

An hour later. Robert calls me back and says that he's with dBoy already, conveniently forgetting to pickup me, and should he get a half for me? I have good street cred, so I talked to dBoy and he hooked up Robert. I knew that Robert pinches bags, but I chalked it up to running and gas.

A couple hours later, I call Robert and he tells me that he's getting pulled over and he'll hit me after the police let him go.  Another hour elapses and still no Robert.  And then he stopped answering at all.

I'm still on paper for assault and battery, so I can't hurt him. I hate junkies and FML.

TITLE: Dinner with Church Girl, POST BODY: I got home from work at my normal 6:00 pm and settled into my sweats for a quiet evening at home when Church Girl called and asked me to come over and she would cook dinner. Not one to pass up a free meal, I said yes, called for an Uber and went to her apartment. 

Church Girl buzzed me in and, lo and behold,, she answers the door in panties and a T-shirt.  I know that you guys will beat me up, but truthfully, I am kinda shy about sex and all that "mushy stuff" .  So I gave her a peck on the cheek and - please don't down me too much - I looked away.  She's not blind, so she noticed that I was staring at the wall and she asked me "what, you never saw a woman in panties?"  I mumbled something about respecting her and asked her to please get dressed. She just shook her head and put on some sweat pants.

Church Girl cooked a delicious dinner of ribeye steak, roasted potatoes with shallots and chives and sweet peppers in a garlic sauce. After dinner, I was helping her clean up and she remarked "see what a good wife I would be?"  I was really hurt in my first marriage, so I guess I froze and she noticed that too.

We watched TV "This is us" but it was getting late since we both work so I called for an Uber home. Then she says "if you were my boyfriend, you could sleep with me and I would make you coffee in the morning."

I called Church Girl when I got home to say that I was safe and she says "Metro you are one weird guy. I don't know why I like you, but I do!"

So, what am I doing wrong?

TITLE: Church Girl Crushes Me and Her Dog, POST BODY: Church Girl and I were playing around, wrestling and joking and laughing, so I made my move with an open mouth kiss. The kiss went well so I kept going and grabbed her ample butt and she hit the brakes.  I was like WHY? And she gave me the ole "you won't respect me in the morning."  I tried my last remaining trick -  begging, but still no go and she was getting pissed off so I threw in the towel.

Not wanting to be one of those guys that pouts when they don't get their way, I suggested that we go to the living room and watch TV.  We were sitting pretty close on the couch and she looks at me and says "Why are you grabbing my ass? I told you NO." I wasn't doing anything and I didn't know what she was talking about. Again she says to me "STOP GRABBING MY ASS." and punched me in the am. So I showed her my hands.

Thing was, she had sat her big butt down on her dog and the poor thing was squirming and wriggling around trying to get from  out under her ass cheeks.

TITLE: Church Girl: The End, POST BODY: You guys warned me, but did I listen? ‚Äì NOOO.  Now I am sitting here crying (guy style crying) on a rainy Saturday with a broken heart waiting for the dBoy. 

Picking up from last time, I showed Church Girl how to crush and snort her dillies.  I warned her about those dillies. I told her that they were dangerous.  I told her that they were addictive.  I said that they could hurt her. I said that they WOULD HURT HER, but did she listen? ‚Äì NOOO.

I was driving to my sister‚Äôs house in another state on Thanksgiving Eve and Church Girl was going to her family Thanksgiving also.  Somewhere down the road, she ODed at the wheel and totaled her car, which was her first brand new car that she had just paid-off, which is a big accomplishment for a young woman just starting out, working and living on her own, and not having some creepy old Sugar Daddy.  Thanks be to God no one was injured.  Nevertheless, she was arrested and charged with DUI ‚Äì UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS.  She had to spend a night in jail and needs a $5,000+ lawyer and she still might do time.  Plus this girl, who was never in trouble in her life, now has a serious record.  And who got the blame? You guessed it muchachos and muchachas ‚Äì ME ‚Äì METRO got the blame for corrupting a shy and sweet, beautiful, innocent church girl.  I feel like Satan himself.

We had a big fight on the phone. She said that she didn‚Äôt want me the way I am. That I had to change this and I had to change that and basically she didn‚Äôt want a junky in her life and that hurt me.  In her defense, I said some pretty rotten things too. Of course, I attacked her slightly overweight body (which I really don‚Äôt mind) and that I didn‚Äôt want her funky, diseased, used-up pussy anyway.

I should‚Äôve have just gone to church to worship. Instead, I was chasing girls who were way out of my league.  I learned my lesson and I‚Äôm going back to my opiate girls. They may steal my stash, but at least they are in my league.  I would also like to try a Tweaker Girl.  If anyone knows any, please send them my way.

So that‚Äôs it. No more Church Girl stories. I am going to get high and stay in bed all day, but thanks for listening my friends.

P.S. Her lawyer told Church Girl that she might get off because the cops made a technical error and only drew one vial of blood when they were supposed to draw two: 1) for the prosecution and 2) one for the defense. Remember this if you get in trouble. 

P.P.S I texted her asking to kiss and make up and she wrote back "YOU ARE SICK AND  HAVE SOME DEEP ROOTED PROBLEMS.  I AM DONE WITH YOU".  Women say the most cruel and hurtful things.  She could've just said NO., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/a257fh/church_girl_the_end/

BODY: Thanks for the detailed explanations,  Ladies. I am very interested in biology. I agree about Viagra for women needing more funding. I heard somewhere that there was an abundance of women 65+ years old who are healthy and fit and quality of life would improve with regular sex, but as you said, woman's sexuality is complex. Also, since men die younger, there is a shortage of single men. Maybe the women can share? I can't wait for 65!

BODY: The most important difference is that Chads have that confidence that comes from repeated., positive experiences.  Some girls like short guys. Some like fat guys. Some like brainy guys. But ALL girls want a CONFIDENT guy and find lack of confidence to be a big turn-off. BUT confidence comes only from experience. It's a Catch 22.

So th is my answer.

TITLE: Why Are We The Worst?, POST BODY: This Church Girl rejection has me down in the dumps and crying and now I am spending all my money with dBoy. Funk the rent. 

Anyway I was thinking : Why are we the worst? At least we know that what we are doing is wrong. The r/incel guys think that they are RIGHT doing their thing. The alt-right guys also think that they are correct. But we are the scum of the earth?

We are not so bad. I mean there are really bad guys in every group and we are no different but on the average we are OK.

BODY: The reason I don't work with girls is because you can't do anything if she rips you off and she knows that you can't do anything hurtful. So without any negative consequences, it's only rational that she WILL RIP YOU OFF EVERYTIME. 

You might take a quantum of solace that sooner or later she'll rip off the wrong dude who has no qualms about hurting her.

Take care.

BODY: Part of the problem is that our brains tend to minimize the painful memories and maximize the pleasurable memories and not only with drugs; it happens with relationships too. I read that this is a protective mechanism. 

So after detox, you think "that was not so bad" and you're off to the races. Does anyone agree?

I texted her:   "Are you still mad at me? "

Church Girl texted back : "" Yes, I don't even know if an apology would work. You spoke very  gross and unacceptable to me. You talk like you are trailer trash and I have no respect for you".

So the next move in this crazy game is mine. Question : Does anyone else like to play this game? , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/a4ajeo/church_girl_update/

TITLE: Church Girl and Priorities, POST BODY: Church Girl called me Sunday morning to tell me that we were going to the 12:30 pm Mass. I don't like attending those late Masses because I want to watch the NFL which starts at 1:00 pm.

So I tell Church Girl that I was sick. She kept pressing me about what exactly was wrong. Finally, I got tired of her nagging so I texted :

The truth is that I don't want to go to church because I am getting high.

She texted back :

There you go excuses, excuses. Your priorities are a mess- getting high instead of going to church.

So, now she is mad at me again, BUT I am proud because I went high when she went
 low and texted back :

Have a good day

What a life. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/a5dn8c/church_girl_and_priorities/

TITLE: Church Girl Sets Me Straight on Toilet Etiquette, POST BODY: I was hanging out with Church Girl on a normal weekday night when I had to see a man about a horse. She was telling me about how her last BF never closed the bathroom door and never washed when he was finished.  OK, I got the hint. No problem.

But then I made the mistake of all bathroom mistakes that any man could make - I LEFT THE TOILET SEAT UP!

Well, you'd think that I had set off a bomb in her house.  She bitched at me for at least 15 minutes straight . I tried  to explain to her that I had not lived with a woman since March 2015 and that I was out of practice. Then, she started-up again and said that she didn't have time "to train a man".

That set me off. LAST STRAW. I am NOT A DOG AND I DON'T NEED TO BE TRAINED. So that's it guys. No more Church Girl. Probably for the best. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/a6cccu/church_girl_sets_me_straight_on_toilet_etiquette/

But there are MANY prisoners (I don't like the word Inmate) who react with extreme violence to any perceived slight. And that can turn very ugly very fast and someone gets hurt. 

What do you guys think..?

TITLE: Church Girl Got Me All Figured Out, POST BODY: Church Girl is getting into my head. She says that I am not an addict, but I am just trying to deaden the pain of childhood sexual abuse by self medicating. IF I go to therapy, the pain will magically disappear and I won't need opiates because I will be cured, so says she. 

I didn't want to fight, so I told her that I would go to the therapist. I have been to therapy before and it was a big waste of time and money.  Moreover, it took me years to bury my pain and hurt and I don't need someone digging it back up.

So fam, should I go to placate Church Girl? Should at least give it a try? I have good insurance, so the money part is mostly covered or should I just tell her NO?

TITLE: Opened Up to My FWB About Childhood Sexual Abuse and It Backfired, POST BODY: This might be the wrong subreddit, but I am trying anyway.

I (m 30s) told my friend (f 30s), who is also my FWB, about my childhood sexual abuse.  I have never told ANYONE about this, not even my now-ex-wife, nor my parents or siblings.  I came to the realization that keeping it bottle-up inside was hurting me and I thought that my FWB would be compassionate and understanding.  First and foremost, because she was my good friend and second because we had shared sexual intimacy.  It went all wrong.

The day after I told her, I texted that I was having a bad day and frankly, that I was crying and could use some TLC.  I knew that I should‚Äôve kept that mess buried.  Questions ran-around in my mind.  How could my trusted Boy Scout leader do that to me?  I was just a kid and I knew NOTHING AT ALL about sex.  And worse, what had I done to deserve it?

She texted me back that she was busy with friends and furthermore didn‚Äôt want to hear that a man she was ‚Äúwith‚Äù was crying and had been with another man.  I was hurt.  Men have feelings too and sometimes we cry.  Maybe not open weeping like a woman is allowed, but we cry inside and maybe that‚Äôs worse.  I was not ‚Äúwith‚Äù another man.  I was a victim of a serious crime of the worse kind.

I don‚Äôt think that our friendship can be salvaged at this point and I am thinking of just cutting her loose, but first I wanted to run it by this group of women.  If I am wrong, tell me what I did wrong.  Do you think that our friendship can be fixed?  

Thank you and have a good day.

TITLE: Remedies For The BIG C, POST BODY: If you do opiates, you will be plagued with the BIG  C - CONSTIPATION. Here are the remedies that I have gathered from r/opiates.

Water and a high fiber diet. This is best in the long run, but it takes time. Also this is the safest and may push you to kicking for good. 

Gentle laxatives like Metamucil and Exlax. This is second best and safe, but it does not always work and relief is not immediate. 

Harsh laxatives like FLEET and magnesium citrate.  These must only be used infrequently since they are not 100% safe but they work in minutes. The purge is violent but the relief is worth. 

WDs.  I promise you that WDs WILL CLEAN YOU OUT.  You'll also save money, but the sickness is... well you know.  Again the sickness may push you to kicking for good. 

Did I miss any remedies?

My dBoy called and said to come through. He usually meets me, but this time he said to come to the house because he had to make it up, so I go inside and down to his man cave.

There was a Spanish guy and a white girl already there just chilling. I sat next to the girl and made small talk while dBoy was making my order.

I get my order and then dBoy asked me to chill for a minute. I was doing good with the girl (or so I thought) , so I said OK. The girl said something to dBoy and he said "NO", but she kept pestering him and finally he said "YES" and he broke-out the glass dick. 

Now, I don't smoke so I was getting ready to leave while they puffed away. All the sudden, they start geeking. My dBoy wasn't too bad, but the white girl and the Spaniards guy were crawling around on the floor looking so any white pieces of crap in the rug. Then it got worse. 

Spanish starts peeking out the blinds, which really gets on my nerves, looking for the SWAT team. .  All. the sudden, the white girl, jumps up, starts screaming and runs out the house onto the front yard, still screaming all the while.

By this time, my dBoy was geeking too and he begged me to go outside and get her. I go outside and  talk her down and she did stop screaming at least. By now, my nerves are shot and I needed to go home and calm down myself. So I finally get her inside and away I went...

AND that's why I don't do hard. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/b7ujkv/why_i_dont_do_hard/

TITLE: Friend is a Jerk - Advice, POST BODY: My "friend", Carol, has been asking me to share nearly everday, but she takes methadone. First, I have heard that methadone blocks dope so you can't get high. Second, she is not going to get sick since she gets her methadone every morning at 6:00 am. Lastly, and most importantly, Carol is very stingy when she is holding. For example, about six months ago, I was down to my last $20 and I asked Carol to  please pick up from her dBoy for me. I was on my way to WDs, but she gave no mercy and she wanted $40 so she could get a dub too. I told her that I didn't have it and could she please do this one favor for me. She gave me the old "felonies at not free" and said NO, NO, NO,,, no matter how much I begged.. So I was dope sick for two days until I could get straight.

Last night when she asked to share, I reminded Carol about this and she acted like she didn't do anything wrong. Then she said that she didn't care about anything that "happened six months ago". To me,, this was the wrong answer. I just wanted a sincere apology and everything would've been OK. BUT after her "didn't do anything wrong" , I just want to tell her to get lost.

What do you guys think.?  If I am wrong, tell me I'm wrong. Thanks for reading., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bnvxzp/friend_is_a_jerk_advice/

TITLE: How Do You Handle the Trap Girls?, POST BODY: This post is mostly for guys, but maybe girls too (although I don't see anyone wanting to eat out Trap girls) . Traps always have girls that are looking to make money to feed their addictions. I feel kinda gross doing money-for-favors, so I usually just throw the girl a dub without any expectations. However then I FEEL like a sucker - I mean I didn't get nada. The black guys just say something like "get away from me you filthy Ho", but I am just NOT that type of guy. Also, they are kinda like birds, if you feed one the whole flock descends. And I feel so sorry for these poor girls.

TITLE: A Visit From dBoy and the Crew, POST BODY: So dBoy comes rolling up with his crew riding 4x4 in the whip. They asked to come in to piss. My roommate was out, so I said "sure, come on" . Now I am mostly a loner and I don't run a party house, but it was Friday night and I was up for some company.

First thing -  they put on the NBA and they are yelling and being all loud. Next into my fridge and my Mickies. Next the backwoods come out. Then they start making calls and bagging and doing business out of my house. I am starting to get a little nervous, but I knew not to show that I was scared.  Then some black chicks knocking at my door with a white guy and a Spanish guy. UGH.

Finally it's getting late and I tell them that I must work in the morning which was a lie. It took them another hour, but they finally decided to go, but they wanted food now. So they asked for my grape soda (hey. I like grape soda too NO RACIST).    Then my Tastycakes, my oranges, my bananas and my watermelon Jolly Ranchers. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

And that's my story of a visit from dBoy and the crew., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bq97kb/a_visit_from_dboy_and_the_crew/

Spanish asked if I would trade a 50 of my fentdope from the Trap for  a 50 of what he had. My Spidey-Sense was tingling and so I asked him why he wanted to trade. Get this: my stuff is too strong for me.

TITLE: REDS - Dope Girl and Sex Worker, POST BODY: You guys seem to like my dope girl stories, so here's one for a lonely Friday night.

A few years back, when Price was still alive, several sex workers hung-out at his Trap. There was one girl that I liked nicknamed Reds, but she preferred Cindy, which I think was her given name. Reds  caught  onto me and like any good sex worker, she played me, but playing will only take a girl so far and sooner or later, she's must up her game. She sent me some pics and it was game on.

Before you judge me for taking advantage of some poor sweet dope girl, try to see it my way and I hope that our sex workers will back me up. . Reds was going to get her money from some man. one way or another. With me, she was 100% safe. She knew that I was not going to rob her, rape her, beat her up,  arrest her or kill her. I didn't hate fuck her and I tried to finish ASAP, which is difficult on dope. I always gave her the full $40 and didn't try to negotiate. When  she was sick, I got her well first thing and who wants to fuck a poopy, pukey, sweaty dope girl in WDs anyway - not me. Most importantly, I respected her. 

Reds was good. She knew how to pleasure a man and I like to think she gave me a little more than the other guys - I know - delusional. Now this wasn't Pretty Woman. For example, Reds would steal anything of value - money, drugs, guns, jewelry - anything. So I had to put everything up. Also, I had to make her shower sometimes and she looked so sexy just out of the shower with her wet red hair and glistening body. I am getting hard just thinking about her. 

After Price died, l lost touch with Reds. Last I heard she was in bad shape, homeless, in and out of jail. Worse, I heard that she had AIDS and YES I got tested. Now a days, AIDS is not a death sentence IF you take care of yourself. 

If you pray, say a prayer for Reds - just one of us trying to survive another day. I will., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bsppwc/reds_dope_girl_and_sex_worker/

TITLE: Get Out of Jail FREE, POST BODY: One of my ex-dBoys, Leprechaun, got popped last summer with a distro charge. I thought that was the last I'd seen of Lep, since he was an old man (50+) and he had an arm-length rap sheet. Lo and behold, I just found out that Lep was OUT! It wasn't a miracle. It was just plain old human error.

The law states that one must be tried in a certain amount of time and if not then the charges must be dropped. In Lep's case, the drug lab was so overloaded that they could not test Lep's product within the time allowed, so they had to cut him free and he's back in the game.

But the cops don't tell you that your time period is almost up. You must have a good lawyer. In one case, the cops or prosecuter told a woman that if she plead guilty that she would be released with time served ALL THE WHILE KNOWING THAT HER TIME WAS ALMOST UP. Of course she took the guilty plea vs. chancing five years at trial. So she was released with a drug conviction on her record. I think that's dirty pool.

I'm not a lawyer and I don't know how this works, but it's worth looking into., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bswei9/get_out_of_jail_free/

TITLE: Nice Girl at the Bus Stop, POST BODY: I met a really nice girl at the bus stop. She started the conversation and asked me if this bus went to her destination. I said yes and we bitched about the bus being late. She was very cute with a page boy haircut, very little makeup, well spoken and intelligent, well dressed, gym toned and just very, very sweet.  When we were boarding the bus, a very large, smelly woman cut in front of me so I lost my chance to sit next to her, but she did say "Have a good day" as I was walking past her to the back of the bus.

I was fantasizing that maybe if I went to the bus stop at the same time tomorrow , I would be able to speak with her again. Then REALITY raised its ugly head. This girl wants nothing to do with a junky like me and I was sad.

I want to STOP. Life is passing me by., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bv34s5/nice_girl_at_the_bus_stop/

TITLE: dBoy Drama: Lep and Robert, POST BODY: I thought you guys might like a story about dBoy drama and street justice. 

Leprechaun was my ex dBoy who was jailed on a distro charge, but the judge had to set him free because the testing lab was overloaded and couldn't test Leprechaun's stuff within the time limit.  So Lep is now back in the Game. 

While he was in jail, Lep signed his car title over to Robert, who was his partner, so that he could sell it and put the money in Leprechaun's commissary account.

When he was arrested, everyone thought that that was all for Lep. He had a long rap sheet and had spent 20+ years in prison. No one, including Robert, imagined that Lep would be out in less than five years. So Robbing Robert just kept ALL the money from selling Leprechaun's car.

When he was released last month, Leprechaun tried to reason with Robert about his money. Obviously, Lep didn't need any more trouble, but Robert being the smart ass thief that he is, told Lep to fuck-off.  On the street, it's one thing to steal, but it's another thing entirely to humiliate a man. 

Lep is about the most violent man that I have ever known. He stabbed a man in the throat over a girl. He hit a man with a brick multiple times in the head because he would not let Lep crash at his crib one winter night when Lep was outdoors. .  But the worse was when Lep hit a tiny girl - a 5 foot 98 pound babygirl - repeatedly with a wine bottle because her husband was getting out of jail and she told Lep that she would not be seeing him anymore. HELL, Lep survived over 20 years in prison so he had to be hard.

Word is that Lep is running the streets telling everyone that he is going to stab Robert. Robert  is supposedly hiding out at his first wife's place until he can get some money and Lep cools down. 

So will Lep really stab Robert or at least beat him up or will Robert wiggle out of this one too?  What say you.?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/bwxnsh/dboy_drama_lep_and_robert/

TITLE: Real Estate and Buyer Access My Apartment Virginia, POST BODY: My landlord is showing my apartment so that he can sell it at the end of my lease.  I understand that it's his property and that he has every right to sell it and that I will have to move.  My question concerns access by the realtors and prospective buyers.  I live in Virginia and I read the applicable chapter in the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (VRLTA).  It was pretty straightforward, but I have questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I read that the landlord must provide *24 hour written notice* stating the people, the date and the time.  My landlord NEVER did this. People just entered using the lockbox on the door.  Is this legal?  Can I tell the people to get out? 

&amp;#x200B;

 The VRLTA said that access should be only during *reasonable* times.  My question is what is reasonable?  To me, 9:00 am Monday morning is reasonable, but 9:00 am Sunday morning is NOT.  I was butterball naked the other day and people just walked in.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am concerned about people stealing.  In my work, I prove bonds so that the customer is protected.  Can I make my landlord fully responsible if anything is stolen?

&amp;#x200B;

I am also concerned about any retaliation from the landlord if I start asking for these lawful things.  I know that he is not renewing the lease, but he can still make my life miserable with the utilities, repairs and such.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a rhetorical question, but why are landlords allowed to make things miserable for good, hard-working Americans who always pay their rent on time?

&amp;#x200B;

TITLE: My Backstabbing Friend Needs a Favor, POST BODY: Around Christmas time, my dBoy got cut-off after messing up the big man's money. I had to go through a middle, who I believed was my friend, to stay well.

My friend demanded a dub each time he middled, no exceptions. One Thursday, I was down to my last $20 until 3:00 am Friday morning. I called my friend and asked if he could please get me a dub with my last $20.  I told him that I would be payed at 3:00 am and would hook him up then.

No matter how much I pleaded, my friend /middle would NOT pickup without a dub for him too. NOW THIS FUCKER IS OUT OF DOORS and wants to stay with me. I have a mind to say NO NO NO.  What would you guys do?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/c1btat/my_backstabbing_friend_needs_a_favor/

BODY: The BIG PROBLEM is that where I live you cannot just kick a man out. You must follow the whole eviction process with courts and judges and sheriffs. He can continue it and it can take a couple months.

I hate seeing anyone outside, but I have to stand firm. I tried to talk with him about the middle thing, but he said  "I don't concern myself with things that happened six or seven months ago."

If I could kick him out easily, I might let him in, but not with this eviction thing. I am going to tell him NO..

TITLE: Grow a Backbone Metro!, POST BODY: I want to thank everyone who encouraged me to push back on the people who were pushing me around. So I decided to grow a backbone, like you said, and it's starting to pay off.

In a previous post, I complained that my dBoy's bags were light.   You guys told me to stop acting like a whiny pussy boy and take it to dBoy.

The next time I met with my dBoy, I told him that we needed to talk.  I said something like "Your halves are light. They should weight over 0.5 with the bag.  You can do that shit to these other crackers, but don't do it  to me."  I was stunned when all he said was "OK."

My next visit to the trap, dBoy called me to the back room.. I thought that he was going to unload on me, but instead he showed me how he calibrates his scale with actual calibration weights, not that penny calibration shit. Then he weighed-out my halves to 0.52.  He also explained that when he needs to re-up, he sometimes makes light bags so that everyone can at least stay well.  I still can't believe it.

So, THANKS AGAIN TO EVERYONE. Metro grew a backbone., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/cbqi92/grow_a_backbone_metro/

TITLE: Problem with New Girl Just Walking into the Bathroom, POST BODY: I have been spending time with a potential new girlfriend, but she has a very bad habit of just walking into the bathroom whenever she wants.  She hasn't caught me yet, but it's only a matter of time until she catches me mid-snort.  When I  explained to her that it was polite to knock before entering the bathroom or any room for that matter, the smart aleck replied with "What, are you ashamed of your dick?"   I tried to explain that using the bathroom is a very private thing for me and for most people and she was like "I've seen everything anyway."

Other than "get rid of the girl", I would welcome any advice. Oh, the bathroom door does have a lock, but it's one of those cheap locks that a kid could push past.  Another problem of this life style., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ccv8ot/problem_with_new_girl_just_walking_into_the/

TITLE: I Saw The Leprechaun!, POST BODY: I have been taking a tolly break, including not triggering on r/opiates.  I had been doing pretty well too!  This evening I thought that I would get some exercise and walk to the grocery store instead of driving.  BIG MISTAKE!

I was walking home from the store and, lo and behold, who do I see but LEPRECHAUN!  Now, I could have said "Hi" and just kept walking, but you know how we are.  Instead I said "Yo,you working Lep? and he said "Yeah, what you want?" and I said "Gimme three dubs" and he said "Wait right here while I go into the house and make them up".  We did the devilish dance, exchanging my hard-earned pieces of paper for three little ziplocs of the destroying brown powder. 

I ran home and locked myself in the bathroom and you all know the rest.  Lep's stuff wasn't fire, but it was OK.  So here I am, back on r/opiates. HAPPY NODS., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/cq0bkj/i_saw_the_leprechaun/

TITLE: Church Girl Gets Off Light, POST BODY:  It‚Äôs a lonely Friday night and I have a good buzz so it‚Äôs Church Girl story time. 

You may remember back around Christmas time, CG ODed on dilaudids and nodded out at the wheel. She rear-ended the car in front of her at a stop light, totaling both her car and the other car. She was so far gone the police had to smash her window to get her out. Fortunately, the EMTs were able to revive her with Narcan. The cops charged her with DWI and the magistrate gave her a PR bond and she was out.

As we all know, DWI is very serious and it‚Äôs not uncommon for even first-timers to get 10 days. Her case was even more serious because the lady in the other car was injured in the collision. I was pretty sure that CG would be exposed to the incarceration side of the criminal justice system, even for a few days. Boy was I na√Øve, because this is what she got.

The charge was reduced from DWI ‚Äì 1st to misdemeanor reckless driving so she won‚Äôt have a DWI on her record. She was given 120 days, all suspended and 12 months unsupervised probation. She was fined $1,000 plus $102 court costs. She has to attend ASAP meetings. Lastly, her driver‚Äôs license was suspended for six months except for: ‚ÄùLicense Is Restricted To Use To And From Work , License Is Restricted To Use To And From ASAP Meetings , License Is Restricted To Use During Working Hours , License Is Restricted To Use For Medically Necessary Travel , To And From Court Ordered Facility , Travel To And From A Place Of Religious Worship.‚Äù. AND THAT IS IT.

It shows how money, a great lawyer and being a pretty white Church Girl can get you out of anything., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/cxqb8k/church_girl_gets_off_light/

TITLE: Failure and Redemption, POST BODY: &amp;#x200B;

This is a story of a young, beautiful girl who was hurt, but not destroyed, by cocaine. I am NOT preaching, because the fact is that I was right behind her.

In the beginning, it was nice, may be once or twice a month.  Our use escalated to Mondays and Fridays, then Tuesdays and Thursdays, then, well you know the rest.  I could not keep pace with her because I didn't have the funds, but otherwise I'd be right with her.

Staying up all night, not eating, not pooping and not hydrating began to take it's toll.  Her silky, long, auburn hair was stringy and unwashed.  Her clothes went from Nordstrom to Goodwill. Her car was always in need of routine maintenance and she went from car dealers to backyard mechanics.  Still, nothing that she couldn't recover from.

She started "dating" men, drug dealers, who she'd not give a second look before. She ran through a series of two month "relationships" with these guys.  It seems that after they got what they wanted, these men had no more use for her. Fortunately, she was not diseased by these "affairs". Also, she pawned her things and then began to borrow and steal from family and friends.

The end came when she developed a deviated septum caused by the coke eating away at her nose. She had good insurance through her parents and the surgeons were able to fix her deviated septum.  All she had to do was to let the surgery heal, i.e. stay away from cocaine for a couple weeks. She could not stay away and the surgery failed, nearly causing permanent damage to her nose. Her doctors knew that she needed help and she accepted the chance to go to rehab.

She's married with kids and happy and healthy now.  Take care., PERMALINK: /r/cocaine/comments/d4mwb8/failure_and_redemption/

TITLE: A Love Affair, POST BODY:  I had a single AP. And it was wonderful. She had her own place where we could steal away (Bob Seager) for mid-day trysts. We quickly moved on past sex and that was my (our) mistake. We walked in the snow under the midnight full moon with her two bulldogs, holding hands and watching the dogs roll in the snow, happy as pigs in shit (both homo sapiens and canines). We shopped fresh food at farmer markets and in the evening we would cook together. I would steal kisses and butt touches in the kitchen, and she would push me away and squirm and squeal ‚Äústop‚Äù like a school girl. BTW, she was a great cook, taught by her Italian grandmother who raised her.

The affair was glorious, but she wanted more. She wanted me to ‚Äúbring my toothbrush and PJs and comfortable clothes‚Äù so I could stay with her overnight. She wanted me to take her to ball games and carnivals. She wanted me to meet her friends. Now my wife gives me a lot of freedom. If I come home at 3am reeking of gin from a night out with the boys, I would get a tongue lashing and a place on the couch. However, coming home at 8am, shaved and clean and in my comfortable clothes ‚Äì well you know that wouldn‚Äôt fly. There were other things. For instance, she bought small, but endearing, gifts that I could not take home without raising suspicion. I had to throw out these gifts that she shopped for and spent her money on and it was terrible. I bought her an Alexa (LOL).

In my defense, I was in a DB and continually rejected by my wife. My mistake was to put ‚Äúlove‚Äù before ‚Äúaffair‚Äù. I could not help myself. Here was this beautiful, intelligent woman, full of life and love and sex, who WANTED ME! How could any heterosexual male resist? It was too much.

A wise man once said, ‚Äúthe higher you go, the harder you fall‚Äù and we went very high and fell very, very hard. It ended with her screaming in the parking lot outside my apartment wanting me to come out and face her. How did I get myself in this mess? I just wanted to be loved and embraced and frankly, to be fucked. Another wise man once said, ‚Äúbe careful what you wish for, it may come true‚Äù.

I hope you liked my story. Did you shed a tear for me? What‚Äôs your story?, PERMALINK: /r/adultery/comments/d5lans/a_love_affair/

TITLE: Single vs. Married, POST BODY: I know that we've discussed this before, but maybe we can look at the pros and cons of single vs. married. I'll start.

If I was a SM, I would NEVER date a MW. First and foremost is the jealous husband thinking that his life is over and he has nothing to lose just because his wife stepped out. So he gets his gun and goes Postal - me, her, the other APs, maybe even the6 kids. AND IT DOES HAPPEN. SCARY STUFF! 

Besides that, the other big issue is being alone, especially on holidays and more especially Christmas. The fact is that the affair is a ticking time bomb. Sooner or later, a SM will no longer settle for being number 2.

Lastly, there are plenty of 40-50 years old SWs. PLENTY!  Unless the MW has a magic muff, count me out.

TITLE: Why I hate dBoys, POST BODY: So dBoy hits me Thursday night and asks if I am good.? I tell him 1) no dollars and 2) no transportation. A while later someone is banging on my front door. Three guesses and the first two don't count - it's dBoy! He took the bus to my apartment. 

So he knows that I am a working man and. the Eagle shits on Friday. He makes him self comfort able and we watch the game. Then he throws me two grams, which I didn't ask for, and says that he'll see me tomorrow.

You know the rest. That's why I hate dBoys., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/d9ujhi/why_i_hate_dboys/

BODY: Unlike you and me, no one really knows the exact time of Jesus' birth. The Bible says that Shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks in the field which happens during the spring time when lambs are born. So you are right, Christ was not born in December. BUT IF one must pick a date, then December 25 is as good as any other and it also coincides with New Year,, so the people get a whole week off work, more or less.  The exact date is of no importance. What is important is Christ's message of God's love.

BODY: Thank you. What I have against pagans is that they are worshipping false gods. My God does not need a magical hammer to call down lightning. Lightning is just a natural part of the universe that He created with just a thought. There is no Zeus or Thor. They are creations of the human mind.  My God is real and He exists every where. He is part of everything. Paganism is cute nonsense and mostly harmless except for another religion that worships a demon god that demands death, amputations and slavery. So the worship of Allah is dangerous. Don't you see?

TITLE: Dude ODs in my Bathroom, POST BODY: My dBoy stops by and brings his wife, his driver and a pizza. We were eating and laughing and joking and having a good time. dBoy asks me if he can meet a customer outside my apartment. I say OK and he goes out. 

dBoy comes back with two white guys and asks if they can take a piss. Big mistake. First white guy goes into my bathroom and was in there quite a while. I knock on the door and white dude says that he is ok. I figure that he was taking a hard dump so I leave him alone. Next I hear a big crash like a body hit the floor. I open the door and white dude is on the floor. I yelled for dBoy to get in here. It was a nightmare. I give the white dude a sternum rub and he come around but goes out again
We drag white dude out of the
barhroom and I get ready for CPR. 

I am panicking because this dude is going to die in my apartment. The chick is crying. Everyone is shouting. I call Carol and ask her where the Narcan is. I get the narcan, load it and get ready to hit white dude. Those narcan needles sure are big. So I hit the dude ane instantly he is awake.
So that was my good deed for the day. Whatdo you think., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/dwhq2i/dude_ods_in_my_bathroom/

TITLE: Good News and Some Bragging, POST BODY: I started anew job on October 3. I was fucking up like calling in when I was dope sick and being slow in general. So they finally they let me go. It wasn't because of misconduct. I was always one time,. I was just slow (guess why). The job just wasn't working out for me. So, the HR people called me in and I was ready for the bad news.
 a
I was wanted to fight for 4 weeks notice from HR instead of the regular 2 weeks. Again, I wasn't charged with misconduct. I was just slow. They didn't really have anything concrete against me.

So again, I go into the HR office ready to fight. The HR lady started talking and basically said "here is$10, 000 check if you agree not to sue and Jujust   go. AHHH.. WHERE DO I SIGN? away, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/dwkdvh/good_news_and_some_bragging/

TITLE: dBoy's Wife Popped Me Hard in the Face, POST BODY: I know you guys must think that I am making up all these stories, but I swear they are true.

I was hanging at the trap, laughing and joking around and cutting up.  I was sitting in the Barcalounger getting my nod on and generally just relaxing. Out of nowhere, dBoy's wife jumps up and punches, not slaps, me, full in the face. Needless to say, I was shocked.

I say something like "you're lucky that you're a woman." It all went down so fast. She says "my momma ODed just like that and now she's DEAD". It took all my self control to not belt that evil üòà vixen.

So that was my Saturday.   How was yours............?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/dxiwgk/dboys_wife_popped_me_hard_in_the_face/

I suggest using clean plastic straws and don't share straws. There is an urban myth that people contacted HIV and HEP C from sharing straws, not to mention the common cold.

BODY: I drink cold ice water. Even if you throw up most of it, some ice water will stay down and it's not that gross if you do puke up ice water. The alternative is to go urgent care and they will give you a saline IV and medicines to settle your  GI tract, but that costs.

From your symptoms, I am guessing that you are on Day 2 or 3. I would try to hang in there, but I am not a  doctor and this is not medical advice. Your know your body. If you think that you are in trouble call 911.

TITLE: Advice on SNITCHING, POST BODY: Before you delete my post and ban me, please hear me out. I really think you guys and girls can give me good advice because of your unique experiences. 

I know a guy who is wanted by the US MARSHALLS FOR VIOLENT RAPE. Specifically, he raped a little boy - a tiny, little, defenseless five-year old boy. Before you jump on me, I don't know where this guy lives but I do know a guy who does know where he lives or at least sleeps.
Obviously, I don‚Äôt want the cops poking around my apartment. On the other hand, I really want this child rapist brought to justice, as I am sure that you all do. On the third hand, I hate SNITCHES. They are only one step above child rapists. 
Please think on this and give me your best advice., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/e0yph7/advice_on_snitching/

TITLE: Cozy - As Tenant Can I Be Held Responsible?, POST BODY: Landlord's lease states that I must pay rent using Cozy. He is always short of money so sometimes I pay him early using Cozy, in this case I used Cozy to pay rent on the 25th.

Landlord calls me 8:45 am Monday 25th while I am at work asking  "Where is my money?" even though the first is still six days away. I tell him that Cozy has already taken the rent from my bank account and that he should call Cozy. He calls me a deadbeat and hangs up. BTW he has had three strokes in the last month, so he is very sick.

This got me to thinking and hereis my question. 

If Cozy does not forward my rent to the landlord for whatever reason (bankruptcy, thievery, etc), can I still be held responsible for the rent? 

And if I am responsible, how can I protect myself.? 

Ps Landlord will not accept certified bank check or even cash, just Cozy. Thanks in advance., PERMALINK: /r/legaladvice/comments/e1hxqg/cozy_as_tenant_can_i_be_held_responsible/

TITLE: You Guys Warned Me, POST BODY: I was walking to the Trap to stock-up for Thanksgiving since dBoy was on-track to his family. I stopped at the Dollar store and bought a box of trash bags and a candle.

I checked out and on the way to the Trap, three kids, a fat boy (like rolls and rolls of fat) and two skinny boys ran up on me and I knew what time it was. 

The fat boy stepped to me and grabbed the Dollar store bag with the trash bags. He swung on me and just grazed me, but fat boy fell down in the street. It was almost funny.. 

 I would like to say that I kicked fat boy in the head and stomped him, but NO. I let him have the Dollar store bag with the trash bags and said "You MFs, I am calling the cops" and all three kids ran away. The last laugh was on them. I still had $300 in my pocket!

It takes about 35 minutes to drive to the Trap when traffic is light and maybe 50 minutes during rush hour. I get to the Trap in 25 minutes and I just wanted to get my stuff and go.

Now I called dBoy three times during the ride asking him to please hold my order and he says that everything is peachy. I get to the Trap, call dBoy and his wife lets me in. So I pull-out my money and dBoy gives me two dubs. I politely tell him that I my order was for two hamburgers - one for me and one for my GF. dBoy says that's all he has and I could take it or leave it. He could tell that I was pissed and he said the he would re--up early tomorrow just to take care of me. Early for dBoy is about 1:00 pm and it's usually 3:00 pm before he Shits, Showers and Shaves and is ready to go. By time he re-ups it's 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm.

I told him that he should've told me and that I could've gone to Lep, but now it's too late since Lep shuts-off his phone at 8:00 pm. Then he pulls some dBoy shit and tries to give me a hit of crack "for free" knowing that I would be off to the races after taking that one hit. I pay for my shit with a C-note because I was originally getting two hamburgers and I ask him for my change. Now get this: **dBoy wants to keep my change because he doesn't have enough money to re-up.** I let him keep my change, take a piss and go.

The GAME sucks and I'm out on January 1, 2020.  Peace Out., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/eh14ez/why_i_hate_dboys/

1. They are always trying to borrow $20. BORROW? WTF? You mean GIVE. You are never going to repay me. I said NO a hundred times and you still persist. Here's two dollars. Now go away.
2. They are always peeking out the window. First there's no one out there. Second if there is someone out there, your peeking is giving them probable cause to knock on the door for a "welfare check".  And you are wrecking the blinds.
3. They are always rug surfing. There is no crack in that rug. Those while crumbs are pieces of stale bread. You did not drop any crack.
4. Burning up the pipe - You hit that empty pipe 20 times. There is no more crack in it.
5. OCD. Wash, rinse, repeat. Do you know that REPEAT means repeat ONE TIME?
6. Sucking filthy dick - Girl, that dBoy has not showered in four days. How can you let him stick that filthy cock in your mouth? Jeez, he just had it up that other girl's ass.
7. They are a general nuisance and ruin my nod. No explanation needed.

TITLE: A Christmas Story - or NOT, POST BODY: I wanted to post something special on my cake day. It's a kinda a sad story, but here it is for your enjoyment - or NOT.

A long time ago there were two beautiful little girls, Angelique and Dominique. Angelique had long jet black hair while her sister Dominque had long blonde hair. They were both so cute and happy and playful. On Christmas Eve, Mom and Dad put all of their gifts under the Christmas tree. There were tons of gifts, not only from Mom and Dad, but also from Grandmom and Granddad and Uncles and Aunts and Cousins and family friends. There were baby dolls and Barbie dolls, coloring books and crayons and games. And there were clothes, beautiful clothes for little girls. It was going to be a perfect Christmas!

Christmas Eve bedtime came and Angelique and Dominique said their prayers and snuggled into bed. They were so excited that they could hardly sleep. They literally could not wait for Christmas morning. It would be so wonderful! But sleep they did. 

During the night, a dark spirit came upon Mom and Dad. To some it was a demon; to others it was just a drug. It looked so harmless. It wasn't a gun or a knife. It was just a tiny piece of white. It had many names: base, hard, ready rock - you can Google them all, but most people just call it CRACK.

So Crack came that Christmas Eve and slowly one by one, the beautifully wrapped Christmas gifts disappeared. First the baby dolls - Angelique and Dominque were too old for them anyway. Then the Barbie dolls - hell they were sexist. And so Angelique and Dominique's Christmas gifts were taken by Crack until finally the gifts were no more.

As it has for billions of years, the earth turned and the sun rose and morning came. Angelique and Dominique jumped out of bed! They ran downstairs - their little hearts beating 160 and their tiny feet moving as fast as they could go. But something was wrong, very, very wrong. Where were the beautiful Christmas gifts? Perhaps it was a joke and Mom and Dad hid the gifts? But no, there were no Christmas gifts anywhere and like the dawn, it dawned on the the girls. As it had with the food stamps and the rent money and the new school clothes from Grandmom, Crack had taken them all. Angelique and Dominique didn't even cry. These two wonderful little girls had become hard, harder than diamonds. They could not be hurt anymore and that was the worse thing of all.

This is a true story, but, yes, I did take artistic license to embellish it some. I changed the names to protect the innocent and the guilty, or maybe I didn't. I hope your liked my cake day story., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ei8yca/a_christmas_story_or_not/

TITLE: Did dBoy Get Me Again?, POST BODY: I thought that dBoy's bags were light, so I asked for advice on r/opiates about a cheap scale. Thanks to you guys, I received a lot of replies and I bought a $10 scale from Amazon that was delivered the other day.

On NYE (today), dBoy was in my area at the clinic and he stopped by my house for a NYE drink (for once he brought his own Mickeys). I bought a half from him and only then I broke-out my new scale. I put dBoy's half on my scale and it registered 0.50 g, which is light considering the ziploc bag's weight. dBoy said "Your scale is wrong. I know my shit is right".  I asked him to Google the weight of a quarter, I hit my coin jar and I put a quarter on my new scale. Lo and behold, my scale registers 0.57 g, while the internet said that a quarter = 0.567 g ([https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f)), which is good enough for government work.

I'm like "what's up with that?" and dBoy starts stammering and stuttering because he knows that he was WRONG ALL ALONG and I just caught him red-handed. dBoy takes his half back and adds to it until it registers 0.6 g with the bag, which is OK (but not cool, I mean, never-mind the rip-offs for the last two years).

So it's time for him to go and dBoy asks if he can buy my $10 scale for a dub, since he needs a new one. Now, it sounded like a great deal at the time because I only paid $8.78 taxed and shipped from Amazon.

 After dBoy left, I started to think about it. Maybe dBoy got me again! Here's my question to all my r/opiates bros and gals: Did dBoy buy my scale because he needed a new one OR did he buy my scale because he wanted to get that scale out of my hands so that I couldn't check him?  What do you guys think?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/eibqb8/did_dboy_get_me_again/

I hurry-up and call him and DAMN HIM TO HELL - he's out of dope. I suspect he was ALWAYS out and just wanted to sell his shitty coke.

I'm not against coke and I sometimes buy a dub when I want to stay-up, like on Friday nights, but I don't buy it from him because his coke sucks. So tell me people, now what I am going to do?

Now, you guys know me by now and I'll be the first to admit that I can be a jerk and that I sometimes push people's buttons. I don't try to be a jerk; it's just the way I am and I am working on it.

So I call Lep around 3:00pm and ask for a dub because that was all my cash that I had on hand and I was getting sick. Lep and I do the deed and I headed-off for cigs and ice cream and $10 cash back, which gave me $20 cash. So, I hit Lep once again about 4:00pm and order another dub. 

I meet Lep and he says something like "You stupid cracker! Why didn't you did do this all at once? Don't call me no more." Nevertheless, he took my money and I head home thinking about how Lep spoke to me and it's time for a new dBoy.

Anywho, I know that I am not completely right and if I had had the cash the first time and was not getting sick, then, yes, I would've done it all at once. 

Thanks for staying with me so far, but I have two questions: 1) did Lep mean don't call him again today or forever? and 2) was I completely wrong?

TITLE: Sunday Funday - OR NOT, POST BODY: Saturday night, I was planning my Sunday: visit family and friends, go to church, watch NBA, get some exercise, have a nice Italian dinner and then a good night's sleep. This is how it really went.

5 AM on Sunday wake-up sick, down some Lope and Pepto Bismal. 

Flop-around in bed until dBoy decides to get his fat ass out of bed at noon so I can get a dub

See that I only have $15 and ask girl for $5. She gives me $2 in return for HALF MY DUB. The worse thing is that I have to put up with her mouth for the next 20 minutes until dBoy is ready.

Hit the dBoy and tell him "I'm a couple bucks short." He complains "You're more than a couple bucks short. I better get my money", but gives me a dub anyway. Besides the money that I spent with him, I helped him big time when he was on the streets. Short memory, I guess.

Get home and girl follows me into the bathroom, making sure that she gets her half. She complains "This dub is big. You're pinching my bags." I tell her that I have to take a line or two for testing purposes. I don't want to give her anything that would hurt her. She says "Don't give me that BS" and takes her half and goes away.

Finally I get well and drop a line to my friends on r/opiates.

TITLE: My dBoy is the Worse, POST BODY: My dBoy is going to get us both in trouble all because his Op Sec is very, very sloppy. Here's what I mean.

One of his customers ODed and nearly died from his pinkish-purple fenta-dope. Now I know that the dope game is rough and I'm not blaming my dBoy, but still, one would think that a dBoy with half a brain would shut-down the store for a week to let things cool-off. Not my dBoy. He was BAU (business as usual) the very next day while the cops were hunting the source of his fent. I don't know if that's big cojones or little brains. You tell me.

Anywho, I'm starting to feel sick, so I ring dBoy on a chance and, surprise, surprise, he answers and tells me to come through. I get to the spot, call him again, and he tells me that he'll call me back in 15 minutes. Now,15 minutes usually means 3 hours, but surprise number 3, he calls me back in 20 minutes and says come-on. 

I park the car and walk around the corner and what do I see ... my enterprising dBoy had a queue of fiends waiting patiently (well as patient as sick fiends can be) for his product. I guess it's true that fiends run to the OD, but nevertheless, I pick-up and head home, thanking Junky Jesus all the way.

So it's just a matter of time before dBoy gets us both in trouble. He's the worst. SMH., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/fjrnfq/my_dboy_is_the_worse/

TITLE: What Do You Eat and Drink for WDs?, POST BODY: When I'm in WDs, I try to stay hydrated and eat a little something. I drink Gatorade or just plain ice water. I believe that the Gatorade replaces lost electrolytes. For food, I eat Saltines or just plain, dry toast just a little bit below burnt.

TITLE: Games While Stay-At-Home, POST BODY: I was trying to think of an opiate game that we could all play while under Stay-At-Home. Here's one.

**The Stages of WDs**

The player tries to list in correct order all the Stages of WDs from initial to final. They player with the most stages in the correct order without dupes wins. For example, if the game was to drive your automobile to the liquor store, the stages would be

1. Get in automobile
2. Check gas
3. Adjust seat
4. Adjust mirrors
5. Set radio
6. Insert key
7. Turn key
8. etc., etc., etc
9. ....

For **The Stages of WDs**, the first three stages MIGHT be (this is just an example and is not correct)

1. Runny nose
2. Puking
3. Pooping

You get the idea. So who is a PLAYER in the GAME?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/fvohfh/games_while_stayathome/

TITLE: I think that I finally hit Rock Botton, POST BODY: Everyone warned me that Rock Bottom was coming, but did I listen NOOOOO! BTW, I did not have to give a blow job, at least not yet, but looking back, a BJ might've been preferable to what I did.  Here's the story.

I finally got a good job, $25/hour with 40 hours guaranteed and full benefits. I know that's nothing to some people, but it's good money to me. Before landing my job, I was drawing unemployment, which is $450/week - not so good, but better than nothing. However the stupid rule is that one cannot draw unemployment pay while working a full time job, even though I will not be paid for three weeks. So I have absolutely no money coming in except for my family's charity of $50 here and there. I don't know how Unemployment expects one to live until the first check, but that's the rule and I can't chance a federal fraud charge.

I was on my way to dope sickness and I absolutely had to be well to go to work on Monday, so I needed at least one dub, but I only had $5 and change. I asked around for a $20 loan, but with COVID everyone is broke. With no other options, I swallowed my pride (I guess that I had to swallow something) and I called my ex-wife. 

Our divorce was very, very messy; heck our marriage was very, very messy. We were both cheating and there are still a lot of hard feelings. I went to "my" house and visited with my ex-wife for an hour, dope-sick the whole time, when I finally asked her for $20. To my surprise, she said "sure" and gave me the money. 

Having to ask my ex-wife for money was my Rock Bottom. What was your Rock Bottom?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/g04wk4/i_think_that_i_finally_hit_rock_botton/

2. On the other hand, the drugs **ARE ACTUALLY INCREASING** the worker's productivity. There is scientific evidence that some drugs **DO INCREASE** human performance. both physical and mental.

TITLE: A Day at the Trap in the Time of COVID, POST BODY: I just had to get out of the house. It was a beautiful Saturday morning and I could not stay cooped-up one more day. The old-time mountain men talked about winter-time cabin fever; well I had cabin fever. So what do you do when everything - bars, movies, churches, libraries - is closed? Well, you head to the one place that you know will be open -- THE TRAP. So I hit the ATM, called Uber and off I went.

Business was brisk at the Trap. Dealers and fiends were coming and going and all that traffic was making me nervous. The guys were literally raking in the dough with the welfare checks, the SSI checks, the Friday paychecks and the COVID stimulus checks all hitting at once. I bought one and one  and tried to relax at the kitchen table.

As I said, I was getting nervous, so I moved to the basement where the crack people are. Like, somehow when the house gets raided the popo won't find us down there - the dumb shit we think. Coke always makes me have a bowel movement, which is, as we all know, a good thing in r/opiates and hell, it's actually a good thing period. The basement bathroom is mostly not so busy (but filthy), so I sat down to "do my duty" as my mother used to say.

Things were just about to come to a conclusion when some crack girl started banging on the bathroom door. She had to TALK to me and she had to TALK to me RIGHT NOW. So that was the end of that. Talk about disappointment! Fortunately my plug/friend was making a delivery near my home. I had to give him $3 for gas (why do these guys never have any gas), but that was a lot better than Uber's $30. I stopped at the liquor store and bought 3 of those miniature margaritas, took a shit and a shower, and had a great Saturday afternoon.

How was your Saturday?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/gcsox3/a_day_at_the_trap_in_the_time_of_covid/

My H was moist and clumpy, which makes it hard to snort, so I thought that I'd Hot Plate it like with C. I scraped a couple lines onto a "microwave safe" plate and took it into the kitchen.

I put my plate inside the microwave oven, punched in 22 seconds,  hit Start and watched my plate go round-and-round as invisible energy dried out my H.

Right then my whatever-she-is starts screaming at me. Thinking that I was warming up last night's left-overs, she bitched: "Did you cover that plate? I'm the only one who cleans splattered food in that microwave". I replied: "Yes honey bunny" and again I lied "yes, I covered it with Saran wrap."

TITLE: This Dangerous Game We Play, POST BODY: Posts are the life blood of any subreddit and since I haven‚Äôt posted in while, I suppose that it‚Äôs my turn to contribute.

I was kicking for about the 20th time and had made it through four hellish days. I was so proud of myself! I had even made it past payday without copping, but as some famous guy once said ‚ÄúPride goeth before the fall.‚Äù 

The fifth day was a Saturday and I was starting to feel pretty good, like 80 percent. I started moving around, doing light exercise, showering and shaving and even some Saturday morning chores such as laundry. I had all intentions of ‚Äúbeing good‚Äù ‚Äì really. Then dboy called.

dBoy said ‚ÄúI have that pink stuff that you like. Do you want me to stop-by?‚Äù I wanted to say ‚ÄúNO, NO, A THOUSAND TIMES NO!‚Äù, but I proceeded to tell myself the usual lies ‚Äì ‚Äújust get one dub and stop, you‚Äôre stronger than that drug, it‚Äôs not that dangerous, etc., etc., etc.‚Äù The lies we tell ourselves are the worse. I said YES.

I got three caps of that pink stuff - fentanyl, U47700 or Benita or whatever the heck it is - and proceeded to ram that poison up my poor, abused nostrils. I was looking forward to an excellent Saturday relaxing in my Barca Lounger with good movies and pizza and beer and just a little dope. Man, that still sounds so delicious. Lastly, I ordered my pizza and sat down to await the pizza guy.

Now maybe it was dehydration or mal-nourishment from pooping and puking for four days. Maybe my blood pressure was low. Maybe it was just exhaustion from lack of sleep or maybe it was just a hot spot. Heck, maybe my tolerance had decreased in just four days. Or maybe it was all of those. In any case, I stood up and went DOWN! No warning, just straight down. On the way down, I smashed my chin into the bookshelf and bit my tongue pretty good and that hurts. 

Remember that pizza I ordered? That‚Äôs what saved me. The pizza guy was banging on my door and my GF wanted me to ‚Äúget my own door‚Äù even though she‚Äôs always first to gobble down the pizza. Finally, she came down to my man cave and saw what was happening. **The Lord had mercy** and GF was able to revive me without Narcan. So close to death was I. So, so close.

So just a word of advice from your friend Metro. Do a tiny shot or a key bump. Fix with a friend. Really, truly, you never know. Thanks for reading., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ikd4uw/this_dangerous_game_we_play/

TITLE: SHAME, POST BODY: I know that addiction is a disease and one shouldn't be ashamed like no one should be ashamed because they have leukemia. Still I am ashamed of my opiate addiction. I don't mean ashamed of the crimes that I've committed to get opiates;  I am ashamed that I can't control myself to stay off opiates. Is it just me or does anyone else feel this way too?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/j51hou/shame/

TITLE: Am I a BIG BIG FOOL for letting the driver double-dip?, POST BODY: When dBoy can't deliver, I bless his driver with either $10 - -$20 in cash or a couple big lines if they get high.

So last night the driver was this very large muslim girl wearing the whole muslim girl get-up, burka and all and three little girls in the back seat. Not that I cared; I just wanted my stuff.

All I had left was a sawbuck, so I apologized and gave it to her. She didn't seem to mind and so we went our separate ways:  me to opium dream land and her to wherever muslim girls go.

I call dBoy and tell him that it's all good and that I blessed the driver. He says that he ALREADY BLESSED THE DRIVER at pickup time and that I was a big fool letting that muslim girl rip me off.

So here's my question: was I a BIG BIG FOOL?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/je3bh1/am_i_a_big_big_fool_for_letting_the_driver/

TITLE: Need Some Advice, POST BODY: Hey guys this is Metro asking for advice. So I am on day 5 of a brutal heroin/fent CT kick. I was just sick and tired of giving up all my money and I was just pissed off at myself for getting hooked. Finally the daily grind of getting heroin was too much. So I think I now have my mind right.

My problem is GF is hooked too and she doesn't want to kick. Thankfully she slept on the couch and gave me the whole bed while I was kicking. I was too stinky anyway. She said that she needs pain medicine meaning opiates for pain.

So here's the jist of it. I want to just jet and get away from drugs.. I know that I will not stay clean if I stick around her getting high, but I can't just abandon the girl with no income and hooked. She being nice to me lately (which is saying a lot for two codependent addicts) so she might know that I am thinking of leaving her. The people on r/adultery are like "50 ways to leave your lover", but I can't just do that. But also I need to think of myself. 

I don't see an easy way out and I am disgusted with myself for being so weak. You'd think I should be strong enough to just say NO, but heroin is so so addictive. So what do you think I should do?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/jk21ji/need_some_advice/

TITLE: Meth Girl, POST BODY: This isn't exactly an opiate story, so down vote or up vote as you see fit.

I met Lisa at the crack house. She was way strung out on meth and crack. Like full on bat poop crazy, cut on herself, paranoid schizophrenic who heard voices and would bang her head against the wall until the cops came to take her to the hospital. But she was cute and had this full head of wild blonde hair and needed a friend. 

I'd take her to Taco Bell or the park or any other cheap date. She'd try to act normal, but I could never be sure that she wouldn't plunge a blade into my chest. I was kinda scared, but I liked the adrenaline rush.

I used to sneak Lisa into the mainframe room at work to fool around since I was married at the time and couldn't take her home. I know, DON'T mess with crazy, but for some strange reason I liked it. It was exciting in that weird way. 

So where is this going? One day when I was at work, Lisa knocked on my door. My wife answered and Lisa asked her "Is it alright if I Fu and Su your husband?" When I got home, it was bing, bang, boom. I couldn't take another domestic violence charge, so I just covered up and had to be good and stay home after that. true story., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k2ubn0/meth_girl/

TITLE: Visiting the Jail High, POST BODY: I thought you guys might like another opiate story. So here goes.

Michelle, my sometimes GF, was hanging with some guy, John, to smoke his crack and drink his vodka. One thing lead to another and somehow Michelle ended up stabbing John, very seriously, close to his heart. Michelle said that John tried to rape her, but I never believed that lie.

The cops came, but Michelle was already gone and on the lam. Her arrest warrant was for felony aggravated assault which comes with 5-20 and not months.

I gave Michelle my car and told her to sleep in it and keep moving around. The cops started hassling me to tell them where was Michelle. I was still on probation and the cops threat was to call my PO and send me back to jail, but I gave those pricks nothing. I convinced Michelle to turn herself in and I drove her to the PD to get the heat off me. The DA let Michelle plead to misdemeanor assault and battery and she got 60 days.

I visited Michelle in jail every Saturday and on one visit I was really high. I don't know if you ever visited someone in jail, but it's not a pleasant experience. Somehow. Michelle knew that I was high. She started screaming at me through the plexiglass, "You're high you MF. You come here to visit me high? WTF?" and on and on.

The deputies started to notice and I was worried that I would no longer be just a visitor. Finally the deputies took Michelle back to her cell for all that screaming. They looked at me funny, but they let me go. I was pissed. I stopped visiting Michelle and stopped sending her money. They let her go after 21 days. I always wondered who she gave up to get that deal.

The moral of the story - don't visit crazy people in jail when you're high.

tldr; Almost ended up in jail while visiting high., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k3ypfy/visiting_the_jail_high/

TITLE: Girlz in the Hood - Part 1, POST BODY: This is one of my best stories and I've been saving it. I parted it out because it's a long story and I didn't want the wall of text. Buckle up boys and girls. 

Domestic Bliss
I was separated from my wife (no surprise there) and living in a run down trailer in a run down trailer park - like low income housing. Although my place was a dump, the freedom was exhilarating. No one to bitch at me about the unwashed dishes or the trash or where I was going or when I'd be back. I had never really lived alone and I liked it.

Ok, so even a trailer park has gossipy neighbors and as a man living the bachelor life style, I was either 1) gay or 2) fucked up. I don't think I'm 1, but I'm definitely 2. I had a couple visitors such as the "mayor" of the trailer park and a few other nosey fucks.

I was settling in one evening when there was a knock on the door. Lo and behold, it was two young girls: Brandy (16) and Angelique (16). Before you go pedo bashing. on me, these where BAD GIRLS. They had been having sex since they were 10 with both boys and girls. They were drinking and drugging at 12 and tricking at 13. They knew what time it was and they knew a sucker when they saw one. And there was mistake number 1, letting their corrupt asses into my domicile.

TITLE: Girlz in the Hood - Part 2, POST BODY:  I really wasn't up for company, but  Brandy and Angelique kinda sorta bull rushed their way in. And ngl I liked the female attention. 
. 
 I said, these girls were bad ( no quotes needed). They wanted to party and I had a bottle of chilled cherry vodka which suited their young palates. I didn't have any drugs, but those girls knew where to get them. All I had to do was provide the money. So I gave them the money to get pills for me and crack for them. They went on a run and I really didn't expect that they would return, but return they did.

At this point, I had made mistake number 2 - providing  two underage girls with drugs and alcohol and that's a serious crime . They actually provided me, but the law wouldn't see it that way.

So we were partying and having a good time watching TV in my living room. Now, I knew that having sex with these girls was wrong, but they started to get friendly and there was mistake number 3., PERMALINK: /r/opiateswriters/comments/k4zjk4/girlz_in_the_hood_part_2/

TITLE: Girlz in the Hood - part 3, POST BODY: Did I say that these girls were bad? Now I'm repeating myself.

Picture in your mind that I'm laying on my couch with two nubile girls. Next thing I know, Angelique starts playing with little Jimmy. 

Now I've done some terrible things as we all have on this junky subreddit, but my conscience got the better of me (stupid conscience) so I flipped over onto my stomach. I thought that was good enough. Mistake number 4 - thinking

But Angelique wasn't having it. She pulled down my pants and and and ... goosed me. I don't mean a high school goose, but a full on porno scene goose.

I jumped up and knew that I had to get these bad girls out of my house. Then Angelique starts crying. Most men begged her for it, but she couldn't give it away to me, she sobbed. Lord have mercy.

Brandy who seemed the smarter of the two, spoke up and said that they wanted $20 each and ride to 711 to leave. I gladly agreed and dumped those bad girls off at 711.

Over the years that I lived in that trailer, I became good friends with Brandy and Angelique and watched them grow up. I always had a spare $20 for them when they were cracked out at 3am. In the end, I genuinely liked them.

So that's the story. Whaddya think?, PERMALINK: /r/opiateswriters/comments/k4zklt/girlz_in_the_hood_part_3/

Second they are cracked up like there is no tommorow. I mean like a 20 rock in one hit. Should I tell them: stop cracking up, stop tricking with the Mexicans, stop stealing from every store around? Right. Third they get ME drugs and I'm sure that they steal half before it gets to me. This is not fun and games. It's real life at it's finest or worst, either one. I give you a good LOLITA story and you all entirely missed the connection. BTW Lolita was only 12. Unlike you, their parents don't give a damn. Angelique's mother used to tie her up so mommy could go out. Brandy's mother tricked her out for crack. Sorry to bust you bubble sister, but I speak the truth.

TITLE: How I Got Shot, POST BODY: You guys seem to want to know how I got shot. Well here is the story. The common denominator is, of course, drugs.

I met Christine in the Elks Lodge of all places. She was on xanax and crack and she was a top shelf alcoholic, like 6 pack in the morning alcoholic. I found out later that she was a biker chick and her old man rode with the Outlaws MC. I don't think that he was a patched in member though.A wimpy ass like me should have never gotten near her, but you know, the moth and the flame.

Christine was fairly attractive although her face was rough. She had long blonde hair, nice boobs, thin waist and a fat ass. She also had a Tonka Toy yellow Hemi Ram pickup with "It's 5 o"clock somewhere" on the tailgate. Best of all she had a SS custom chopper that she rode like a demon.

One Saturday, Christine on her chopper roared into my driveway and came to my door dressed in her biker nymph outfit. My Oh My. We were talking and she just climbed into my lap. And BOING, it was on. This was not my fault. No man could resist. No man.

We settled into some type of relationship with me on heroin and her on alcohol, crack and xanax - like 5 footballs a day, half a bottle of Crown and a rock of crack.

She talked me into buying her a handgun, since she was a felon and she needed a straw man. She was afraid that the Outlaws would come to get her. She wanted this $590 Glock .40 caliber, but no way I was buying her that. I bought her this $125 .22 revolver made By Charter Arms or Raven Arms or Phoenix Arms - one of those cheap gun manufacturers. The gun was a POS. Sometimes it fired. Sometimes it didn't.. A gun guy told me that it had weak hammer pull or something. You gun guys here might know what that means. Anyway a true Saturday Night Special.

One night, Christine was cracked out of her mind and swore that there was someone outside her house. I looked out. It was 3am and nothing was moving - not even the rats.But she runs out, gun locked and loaded. 

After a while, I decided to go out too. Bad move. I don't what Christine was thinking, but she shot me in the arm. Thank God it was a 22. The bullet took off some skin and meat from my bicep.  I wrapped up my wound and it healed OK. And that's it. No big firefight in the street. Sorry to disappoint you., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k5l4dn/how_i_got_shot/

TITLE: Girlz in the Hood - Postface, POST BODY: Some of you are all worked up about my story "Girlz in the Hood" - calling me chomo, deleting my story, etc. What you don't realize is that I manipulated your minds into believing that something happened that didn't.  Here's how I did it.

I deliberately broke the story into three parts like a serial movie. I told you that I didn't want a wall of text, but that was not the real reason.

I set the scene to further the plot. A lonely man living alone, add forbidden love and drugs and one has a damn good plot. If I made the girls 20 and 22, I mean, who would care?

I teased you and led you on at evey step. I built to the climax. And then I dropped you down the elevator shaft- no sex, not even kissing.

I was surprised that so many of you fell for my simple storytelling tricks. Hell, I'm just a hack writer on a Reddit sub. Nabokov I'm not.

What does it say about you being so easily fooled? Maybe on some level, it was you that wanted me to have sex with those young girls. Think about that homie.

In the end, "Girlz in the Hood" is just a story. You don't know if it's true or not and I'm not telling., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k5uwo8/girlz_in_the_hood_postface/

BODY: This whole 18 thing came out of the Vietnam War. The argument, which is hard to beat, was that if one is old enough to be drafted at 18 and kill and die, then why can't we vote? Why can't we drink? Now the voting part turned out ok, but the drinking part was a total disaster. I mean, one just cannot have 18 year old kids drinking and driving and dying. So the states returned to 21 for drinking (except for some near beer states) and the law was changed and now ruled that in everything else, 18 was an adult and totally responsible for their own actions. That's the way it is presently.

TITLE: Dope Dck, POST BODY: I know that I'm a cnt hair from being banned, but I thought you might like a dope dck story.

I was hanging out at this crack house just enjoying my nod and watching the crackheads carpet surfing. I forget how I even got there, but everyone must be some place and there I was. It goes like that with our life style.

After a while, everyone left and it was only me, the brother who owned the place and his white GF/wife. When you are nodding, time slips away like sands through an hourglass (some soap opera).

Anyway, the couple asked me if I wanted to go back to the bedroom. I guess I looked clean enough and attractive enough to deserve this honor. I didn't want to insult my hosts, so I said sure.

Now I should've explained about dope dck. I just can't cum. I tried and tried. I beat off furiously time and time again until my dck was chafed and my arm ached and still nothing.

So, the husband had this fetish (maybe I should post in fetlife?) where he liked to watch his wife suck dck while he ate her out and watched. So we get down to it and she's sucking and he's eating and I'm praying "Please sweet Jesus, just this one time let me cum. I promise that I'll be good".

Well I don't know where Jesus was, but it was not to be. Next thing the girl starts sobbing because she couldn't get me off. It was not a big deal to me, but some girls take that sht seriously.  I tried to explain that it was me, not her, but they weren't having it. Like I said, the wife is crying and the husband shoots me the LOOK like "you made my wife cry and now I'm going to make you cry". I said "Thanky thanky" and got the hell out of there.

I'd like to say that I performed like a porn star, but this is real life and that sht don't happen in real life. End of story., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k6kw79/dope_dck/

TITLE: Partners in Crime, POST BODY: This Covid lockdown is going to use up all my good dope stories. I wanted to save this one, but here it is. Oh, don't ask me if it's a true story. Decide for yourself.

We return to my favorite partners in crime, Brandy and Angelique. One night/early morning they are banging at my door saying "Metro, let us in. Lets us in." I let them in and tell them that I don't have any money for them tonight, so sorry. They say "We have money, but this Mexican guy is after us and we're scared". My fatherly instincts kicked-in and I told them to stay in the back room and keep quiet. If I had to fight, I didn't want to have to worry about them.

The Mexican, let's call him Taco, must've seen those two delinquents run into my house. So Tac nnno comes knocking at my door. It seems that Brandy and Angelique were selling demos by cutting up Ivory Snow soap and selling it to those Mexicans as dope or crack.
I told you those girls were bad.

I lied to Taco and told them that the girls were not at my house and to get away from my door. Don't you know it, but Taco banged on my door for the next 45 minutes. He unscrewed my porch light and then I knew I had to call the cops. The cops pulled up and I told Taco "I asked you nicely to leave. Now you can't leave".

The cops told Taco to go home. Brandy and Angelique were smoking crack in my bedroom and I laid down on the couch. What a night. End of story., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k6udnl/partners_in_crime/

TITLE: Conspiracy Theory, POST BODY: I love conspiracies, but they are usually just so wrong. If I was smart, I'd sit back and grin like the Cheshire Cat, but I'm not. So let me address the conspiracies.

Attention Seeking: Confirmed. Fuck we're on lockdown. No movies, no bars or restaurants. Cold Uber food. Afraid to go anywhere due to Covid. Bored out of my mind. Of course I want to interact with my fellow Redditors and you know that I love all of you. I think of you as my friends. You like attention too. Don't deny it.

Fake Stories: Plausible, but I'm not telling. I've dropped plenty of hints, but you decide.

Underage Girls: Busted. I never said that I had sex with either Brandy or Angelique when they were under 18. In fact, I said the opposite numerous times. But if you are still questioning, let me give you the back story.

These girls are NOT children. They are very sexually experienced with both boys and girls since 10. Second they are cracked up like there is no tommorow. I mean like a 20 rock in one hit. Should I tell them: stop cracking up, stop tricking with the Mexicans, stop stealing from every store around? Right. Third they get ME drugs and I'm sure that they steal half before it gets to me. This is not fun and games. It's real life at it's finest or worst, either one, Their parents don't give a damn. Angelique's mother used to tie her up so mommy could go out. Brandy's mother tricked her out for crack. Sorry to bust your bubble, but that's the truth. I take care of these girls. I give them money, food and a safe place to crash. You just assumed that I took advantage of them. 

Poor Writing: Plausible. It's hard to write on a phone.

Dichotomy on Meth Girls: Confirmed. Love/hate is what that's all about. I can't wait to get a meth girl. Please, please DM me.

The forbidden fruit is a metaphor for us gaining our independence from God.The angels or watchers wanted to keep us in a dream state. Treating us like infants and keeping knowledge of good and evil and our own mortality away from us.

We humans stepped up and said "NO"! God gave us free will and we'll take our chances on our own. So we were kicked out of the Garden of Eden which is also a metaphor for the dream state. Now we must earn our bread by the sweat of our brow. Which is the road we chose.

TITLE: You Guys Warned Me Not To Gamble at the Trap, POST BODY: I should've listened to you guys about gambling at the trap. So a couple weeks ago, I was having a good night and I was up a few hundred. Now this one dBoy was out of cash, but he still wanted to gamble, so I took his marker (just a Post-It note, not a real Casino marker) for $200. To quote Tony Soprano "He wagered and he lost and he wagered and lost again." 

Now dBoy avoids me and seems to not want to honor his marker. I'd like to have my $200, but I won't starve if he doesn't pay up. I refused product on principle because this was gambling, not dope and he would likely give me some cut to hell BS anyway. I don't want to embarrass the guy, but he needs to stand up and pay his debt. Whaddya you think?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k722sf/you_guys_warned_me_not_to_gamble_at_the_trap/

TITLE: I was raised to hate Nazis, POST BODY: I was raised to hate Nazis. How they started a world war that killed over 50 million. How they slaughtered the Jewish people and enslaved everyone else. The first time I saw a Nazi concentration camp number tattoo on an old polish catholic priest, I was enraged. My grandfather killed every Nazi he could. It's just the way I was raised.

My confession is that this hatred spills over to present day Germans who had nothing to do with Nazis.  I know it's wrong, but I can't help myself. And no, I'm not a Jew., PERMALINK: /r/confessions/comments/k72zmy/i_was_raised_to_hate_nazis/

BODY: Philia = ancient greek word for brotherly love as in Philadelphia? Is that correct?

 The problem I'm having with your argument is that you are missing the role of taxes and tariffs. As in, Mr. Billionaire, you made $500 million passively? We the people are taxing half of that with capital gains. Globalization company you want to outsource jobs? Fine, we can't stop that. It's a free country. But we'll put a 50% tariff when your products are imported. And guess what, the government is banned from buying any of your products made overseas.

TITLE: Are My Stories Fiction?, POST BODY: Conspiracy says that all my stories are a complete fabrication. I'm going to give you the answer  this one time and one time only.

In "Dope Dck", I tell the story of a couple inviting me into their bedroom for fun and games. Now that much is completely and honestly true and frankly not all that hard to believe.

Then I write "and I was praying 'Sweet Jesus let me cum'". I was getting my dck sucked! Did I actually pray to Jesus? I know that I was concentrating as hard as I could, but praying? Probably not, but the sentence worked and added a little humor into the situation, so I took artistic license. The thing is, you already knew that. 

Nevertheless, the story is true. Do you see that now? This is the last time I'll respond to fact or fiction., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/k74xip/are_my_stories_fiction/

"He pulled out (whatever words they use for tube). Do you want me to put it back in?". The surgeon replied "No, I'm almost done down here. Leave it out" The surgeon closed and the nurse wheeled me into recovery. What surprised the nurses was that I was able to remember the conversation between the doctors. You're not supposed to remember anything on the benzos they give you, but I guess that my tolerance was too high from years of drug abuse. I just wanted to encourage OP to tell his doctors about his drug abuse. That's all.

Oh interrogatory: why was Riley a hero, when he had real violence and crime in his stories, but I'm a POS? Anyway, here goes.

I was working as a programmer for a Federal law enforcement agency. It has a three letter acronym that I can't say, but you can probably guess. You thought from the title that I was working as a snitch?

After a couple months on the job reading software documentation, my clearance came back good (I still don't know how that got through) and I could start working on real projects.

I was assigned to the confidential informant (CI) team and I got down to coding. Now the CI database (db) had all the personally identifiable information (PII) for all the CIs working for the bureau - names, addresses, phones, employment, crimes, cases amount of money they were paid (did you know that one can get paid for snitching?

After a couple months on the job reading software documentation, my clearance came back good (I still don't know how that got through) and I could start working on real projects.

I was assigned to the confidential informant (CI) team and I got down to coding. I was deep into my heroin addiction and dBoy would meet me outside the building and I would get high at work. Don't bust on me John Dough. I know that it was stupid - getting high in a federal building. I guess I should add that to my list of reckless and dangerous choices. SMH

Now the CI database (db) had all the personally identifiable information (PII) for all the CIs working for the bureau - names, addresses, phones, employment, crimes, cases, amount of money they were paid (did you know that one can get paid for snitching? I didn't). Literally a treasure of info in the wrong hands. I cracked the encryption (ok the password was in the original code, sloppy coding) and downloaded the db to a USB drive.

I took the USB drive to my old head friend, Hippie, and asked him if anyone (bikers, mafia, etc.) might want to know the snitches in their organizations. Hippie said "You need to smash that thing right now. Those criminals will just kill you and take it or else your looking at 20 to life in Federal. Supermax." I hit the USB with the hammer.

I worked that job for the next two years and I never got in any trouble.

BODY: Heroin is a weird and wonderful drug and, like any drug, the side effects can vary between people. Now a common side affect is inability to ejaculate while high. In WDs a common side effect is premature ejaculation as the dulled senses return. Does not make any sense?.

Your question was is he fuck boy material. Sorry for your friend, but heroin addicts are not fuck boys. He may use her for money, rides or just a warm bed, but he's not going to use her for sex. And heroin addicts aren't really cheaters. Sure there are plenty of willing girls in the game, but they are mostly ignored.

You/your friend should continue the relationship, but buckle up. It's a wild ride.

BODY: We rebelled against God because He wanted to keep us in the dream-like, infantile state that was the Garden of Eden. Then He put us out and we were on our own and we learned to take care of ourselves. We built great cities with churches and schools and hospitals. We are progressing to the stars. Knowledge is a good thing, even the knowledge of good and evil. God wanted to keep us down, in blissful ignorance, like the animals. Maybe He forgot, but He made us in his image and likeness. So we took a chance and I think we won.

BODY: Do you meant drug debts? A lot of times, nothing happens. The debtor is just cutoff and even that's not permanent. Mostly a person is hit several times and given a chance to pay up. Very rarely a gun or knife is used for big debts, like over $1000. Very, very rarely the debtor' s kids and family are hurt like with the cartels.

It depends on the viciousness of the dBoy and some are very, very vicious.

TITLE: What Does 420 Friendly Really Mean?, POST BODY: Covid lockdown and curfew has me bored and lonely, so I've been scanning dating sites. Some posts say "420 friendly" and I'm not really sure what that means.

Does it mean don't be surprised if your date fires one up? I'm not opposed to weed, but I don't partake because of the paranoia. However, If someone wants to toke, I'm cool.

Or does it mean that I'm supposed to toke too? Because I'm not going there. 

Or does it mean that I'm supposed to bring weed? Weed is hard for me to get. I have to go to the trap house and put in my order and wait a day. Sometimes I can beg dBoy to sell some of his private stock. And there are so many different kinds of weed - OG Kush, Fruity Pebbles, Haze, Sour Diesel, etc. I really don't know what I'm doing when buying weed.

Can someone set me straight?, PERMALINK: /r/dating_advice/comments/kcdbik/what_does_420_friendly_really_mean/

TITLE: Finding a Connect - Get Creative and Be Patient, POST BODY: It seems that some us on r/opiates are having problems finding a connect or dBoy.  Here's a story about the best pill connection that I ever had.

I used to pickup my frenemy, Carol, after work and drive her home to an apartment that she shared with her mom. Now in the apartment's parking lot, I would always see this old black man scooting around in his motorized wheel chair. My addict mind kicked into gear and I thought to myself "He must get good pain pills just like my cancer girls."

One day, I started a conversation with him and we talked about everything but pills.  His name was Linford and we continued to speak nearly everyday. Linford's refill day came and he asked me to pickup his prescriptions. I, being the nice guy that I am, said OK and retrieved his pills. Then I, being the addict that I am, looked at his pills and Holy Virgin, he was getting 180 OC80s per month. That's six OC80s per day!
 
Nobody can take that many OC80s a day and I politely asked if I could buy some pills. Linford didn't know the price and I didn't want to cheat him, so I gave him $100 for three OC80s. By thinking outside the dBoy box, I was able to find a great pill connect.

End. Of story, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/kcp79n/finding_a_connect_get_creative_and_be_patient/

We learned in DV class that the law (Federal Violence Against Women Act) states that the man has a duty to retreat unless the woman has a deadly weapon.

BODY: Fent is a clumpy white powder, but it's can also be pink or purple. If you are opiate naive and you hit a fent hot spot, you will OD. Not might, not maybe, you will go down. A couple things you can do is 1) fix with a friend that will call 911 before you take your shot  2) have narcan on hand. Take care. Drugs are a dangerous game.

BODY: First thank you all for a great story. Perhaps you can help me calm down my female cat, Happy.

She always has what I'd call in humans, an ATTITUDE. She struts with her tail held up like she's the Queen of Sheba. And she's obnoxious as hell. I will be in the bathroom taking some private time and she's meowing and putting her little paws under the door. She jumps out and bites my ankles and runs away before I can catch her little heathen butt. She runs and jumps all over my place - on the furniture, on the table, upstairs, downstairs. It's like she's on meth, running every which way in my apartment. She's over 5 years old so she's not a kitten. I had a big male cat and he was so chill, but this little vixen needs calmed down. SMH

I want to use so bad even though with my low tolerance my next shot might kill. My life is great and at the same time it's incredibly boring. Like Ground Hog day boring, over and over.

Now I don't know about meth WDs, but heroin WDs are very difficult. Meth WDs might be worse though, so I understand that.

Is it fear that you don't reach out for help or shame? There's no shame. People a lot better and stronger than you or me have gotten hooked. 

Take care.

TITLE: How Do You Hide Addiction from Normies?, POST BODY: I was never really concerned about hiding my drug use from people, excluding my family or work, because I was always around other drug people - opiates, coke/crack, meth, even weed.

I am considering jumping back into the normie pool (yes like Church Girl - I'll never live that one down), but they ask so many questions. For example:

Why do you have to run home at 4am or why do we have to stop at your house?

Who are you talking to and why do you go outside to talk?

Where are you going?

Why are you always ripping and running?

Who are you meeting?

Are you sure you're not married?

Why are you falling asleep at 7pm?

Etc ad infinitum.

This pushes me into lie after lie which eventually leads to "You're nothing but a big liar. My ex lied all the time too ... bitch, bitch, bitch."  The fact is, you forced me to lie with your interrogations.

PA - you can't leave the state and if you're a server or bartender you can't even make an honest living

VA - curfew. Everyone in their houses by 12am. No more than 10 people in your house. What's next? Curfew breakers will be shot on sight?

FL - Gestapo raids a house with a woman and children with guns drawn all because she told the truth when they could have sent two detectives in suits to politely knock on her door.

CA - stay at home order and don't dare go outside without your mask. 

Next they will be forcing people to get the vaccine, dragging them kicking and screaming if they have to. It's like we are living in a communist country.

Even r/rant which houses the most ridiculous nonsense tries to silence those of us who dare to speak out. SMH.

BODY: To answer your question, he'll be charged with misdemeanor assault with DV and booked into the local jail. He will be brought before the magistrate or judge likely on Monday for arraignment. This means that his charges will be read to him and he will be asked if he understands. The magistrate/judge will ask how he pleads and he will be allowed to enter a "not guilty"  plea.

Next a court date will be set and he will likely get bail or even a PR bond after he promises to appear in court.

You will be served a subpoena to testify against him in open court. His lawyer will subject you to brutal cross-examination and try to prove that you provoked him. 

If he's found not guilty by the judge, he will be set free immediately. If he's convicted, he will likely receive jail time, supervised probation and ordered to attend DV classes.

I hope that helps.

TITLE: OPs Asking if It's Safe., POST BODY: I frequently see posts where the OP asks if a drug or dose or combination is safe. Evil Metro wants to reply "Hell yeah it's safe. Bang it, smoke it, snort it or ram it up your ass. It's all good."

Here is the truth: nobody on r/opiates can tell you that it's safe. Drugs, especially opiates are inherently dangerous. Hundreds die every day from ODs. Second, we don't know you or your drugs. What is a good nod for us may kill you. We don't know if your drugs are H, fentadope or rat poison and forget about purity. Lastly, do you really want to risk your life based on what a Reddit stranger says? This is the real question that you should be asking.

What is your sin?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/khsk0o/ops_asking_if_its_safe/

She always has what I'd call in humans, an ATTITUDE. She struts with her tail held up like she's the Queen of Sheba. And she's obnoxious as hell. I will be in the bathroom taking some private time and she's meowing and putting her little paws under the door. She jumps out and bites my ankles and runs away before I can catch her little heathen butt. She runs and jumps all over my place - on the furniture, on the table, upstairs, downstairs. It's like she's on meth, running every which way in my apartment. She's over 5 years old so she's not a kitten.

One normie girl called the cops on me and let them in while I was taking a hit of crack. It's no fun having 5 cops tearing up your house while you're high on crack.

Second, a lot of "gun guys" (25%) are mental and they are strongly prohibited.

Thirdly, if you think a downer drug user is going to get up the energy for mass shooting of innocent people, you are sadly mistaken.

Next, you're wrong if you think having all these expensive guns makes you safer. In fact, you are less safe because you now are a target. Unless you have a pocket gun in your bathrobe, you won't stand a chance when they blast through your front door. No one is going to break into my house for a little 25. 

Lastly, I have a God given, not ATF, right to defend myself and my household.

Next, when normie chick arrives, put ice or steak (I heard of the steak cure) over your eyes. She will not even notice the pin points. If she asks to look at your shiner, just tell her "no it hurts too much."

If she asks how you got the black eye, it's best to just lie to your normie girl and tell her that you had to "teach some manners" to  sone white bikers who were harassing some girls.

Now stop Redditting and go ahead and bash your eye..

TITLE: Dodging the MRSA Bullet, POST BODY: This story is how I nearly caught MRSA.

I was living with this white dboy , Clyde , in his studio apartment. I was sleeping on the floor, which was ok, except for his big male cat that licked the top of my head everyday at 4am. That animal was a nuisance.

One day after work, Clyde asked me to deliver a bag to his FWB, Jacky, who was in the hospital. Jacky also wanted a burger and fries from Five Guys, which is the local homemade burger joint. I changed from my work clothes and I picked up the burger and fries and drove to the hospital.

So I find Jacky's room and headed in for a visit and gave her the dope and burger. She was looking kinda cute in her hospital gown and I gave her the once over. She caught me looking and gave me one of those womanly sly smiles like "I know you want to fuck me" and she re-positioned herself in the bed with her legs invitingly open. I was ready to drop trowel when out of nowhere a nurse came running into the room waving her hands and shouting "No no no".

Now I didn't know if it was the dope or the burger or the coitus interruptus, but it was none of those. What I didn't know was that Jacky had MRSA and I was supposed to put on the hazmat suit before entering her room. So I too was headed to MRSA city, but the Lord had mercy.

Delivering dope to a sick woman in the hospital and then trying to fuck her. GD, I'm a POS., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/kn3mnx/dodging_the_mrsa_bullet/

TITLE: How I Got Shot by GF in Psychosis, POST BODY: You guys seem to want to know how I got shot. Well here is the story.

I met Christine in the Elks Lodge of all places. She was on xanax and crack and she was a top shelf alcoholic, like 6 pack in the morning alcoholic. I found out later that she was a biker chick and her old man rode with the Outlaws MC. I don't think that he was a patched in member though.A wimpy ass like me should have never gotten near her, but you know, the moth and the flame.

Christine was fairly attractive although her face was rough. She had long blonde hair, nice boobs, thin waist and a fat ass. She also had a Tonka Toy yellow Hemi Ram pickup with "It's 5 o"clock somewhere" on the tailgate. Best of all she had a SS custom chopper that she rode like a demon.

One Saturday, Christine on her chopper roared into my driveway and came to my door dressed in her biker nymph outfit. My Oh My. We were talking and she just climbed into my lap. And BOING, it was on. This was not my fault. No man could resist. No man.

We settled into some type of relationship with me on heroin and her on alcohol, crack and xanax - like 5 footballs a day, half a bottle of Crown and a rock of crack.

She talked me into buying her a handgun, since she was a felon and she needed a straw man. She was afraid that the Outlaws would come to get her. She wanted this $590 Glock .40 caliber, but no way I was buying her that. I bought her this $125 .22 revolver made By Charter Arms or Raven Arms or Taurus Arms - one of those cheap gun manufacturers. The gun was a POS. Sometimes it fired. Sometimes it didn't.. A gun guy told me that it had weak pull or something. You gun guys here might know what that means. Anyway a true Saturday Night Special.

One night, Christine was cracked out of her mind and swore that there was someone outside her house. I looked out. It was 3am and nothing was moving - not even the rats.But out she runs,  gun locked and loaded. 

After a while, I decided to go out too. Bad move. I don't what Christine was thinking, but she shot me in the arm. Thank God it was a 22. The bullet took off some skin and meat from my bicep.  I wrapped up my wound and it healed OK. And that's it. No big firefight in the street. Sorry to disappoint you., PERMALINK: /r/meth/comments/kpah6h/how_i_got_shot_by_gf_in_psychosis/

TITLE: Rules for Street Deals, POST BODY: What are your rules for street deals? I'll go first.

Here are my rules for street deals.

If it feels wrong, it is wrong. Trust your gut feelings.

Beware of smiling faces. Grumpy dealers (think Biggie) are the best.

Don't get out of the car.

Don't let anyone in the car especially chicks.

Only bring as much money as you are prepared to lose.

And the number one rule is never, ever let your money walk., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/kpm6ut/rules_for_street_deals/

I'd like to point out that even normies see visual distortions (shadows), especially at night at the periphery of their vision. In my town, everyone thought they saw a cougar and overreacted - get the gun and hide your pets and your kids. Finally a security camera got a good pic of the cougar and it was only some lady's big Maine Coon cat prowling around. Now this was a fat cat, maybe 25 lbs, but it was no cougar.

So weigh in people - Shadow People: Fact or Fiction. I'll keep score and please do not reply "maybe yes, maybe no" because I don't know how to score that., PERMALINK: /r/meth/comments/kq8loy/shadow_people_fact_or_fiction/

I keep hearing about good girls wanting bad boys. That's cool. To each their own. But don't be crying when he's ripping and running the streets or when he's robbing and drinking and drugging and gambling and fighting and stood you up. That's what bad boys do. But the absolute worse is girls making him their "project" and wanting to tame bad boy. SMH. I think what you really want is a church boy with a Harley and some ink.

On the other hand, these good boys want a wild chick and then don't know what to do with her. She's got a Saturday Night Special and a ball gag in her purse and you freak. Then you guys get butt hurt when she's banging her ex, her FWB, some randos and her girl friend. She sends you a sexy vid of her blowing clouds in her underwear and you get all worked up. Dude, just be satisfied with what you get. What you really want is a church girl with a short skirt and a tramp stamp.

TITLE: No Good Deed Goes Unpunished, POST BODY: 
No Good Deed Goes Unpunished or Clean-Up that Mess by Metro

Linford the Quadriplegic

I was deep into my opiate addiction, but I was still working. I suppose that made me a high functioning addict. I would pick-up my frenemy, Carol, after work and drive her home to an apartment that she shared with her mom. Now in the apartment's parking lot, I would always see this old black man scooting around in his motorized wheelchair. My addict brain kicked into gear and I thought to myself "He must get good pain pills.‚Äù

One day, I started a conversation with him, and we talked about everything but pills.  His name was Linford and we continued to speak nearly every day. Linford's refill day came, and he asked me to pick up his prescriptions. I, being the nice guy that I am, said OK and retrieved his pills. Then I, being the addict that I am, looked at his pills and Holy Virgin, he was getting 180 OC80s per month. That's six OC80s per day! Nobody can take that many OC80s a day and I asked if I could buy some pills. Linford didn't know the price and I didn't want to cheat him, so I gave him $100 for three OC80s. Over time, we became friends. I would watch the games with him, help him with his paperwork, feed him ice cream and other things one would do for your quadriplegic friend. 

Reds the Sex Worker

Her name was Cindy, but everyone called her Reds on account of her long red hair and I met her at the trap house. Reds was a crack and heroin addict, which she supported by selling her body. Now, I‚Äôm not going to tell you that Reds was the Hooker with the Heart of Gold. She wasn‚Äôt. Reds ripped me off hundreds of times, but it was never personal; she was sick. Lots of people hated Reds, but not me. There was something about her. I can only explain it by quoting a song ‚ÄúShe had the music in her‚Äù. (Kind of like my friend, Kassy) and she cast a spell on me. When she was sick, I would throw her a dub. The dope boys said that I was a fool, but hell, that‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs in my blood.

The Deal

I wanted to do something nice for Linford and I was pretty sure that he hadn‚Äôt had a woman in a long time. Linford was not ‚Äúfully functional‚Äù, but there was nothing wrong with his mouth. I explained the deal to Reds. I would pay her $50 to let Linford eat her out. Since Linford was a quadriplegic, Reds needed to be gentle and respectful.  I wouldn‚Äôt touch her, but I wanted to watch. (Another one of my many sins ‚Äì voyeurism).  And I would hunt her down if she fucked-up. Now, I don‚Äôt know if it was the money or the pussy licking or the quadriplegic thing, but Reds was stoked. She wanted to go like right now!

We get to Linford‚Äôs apartment and I explained the deal to him. He was less enthusiastic than I had hoped, but he didn‚Äôt say no. I helped him into his bed and went to get a chair from the kitchen so that I could watch in comfort. By this time, Reds had already taken off her clothes and I was a little pissed off because I didn‚Äôt want her to rush things.

The Deed

Reds lowered herself down onto Linford‚Äôs face and God only knows how, but that negro knew what he was doing. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever watched sex IRL, but it‚Äôs not the same as porn because you don‚Äôt have the camera‚Äôs POV, so you can‚Äôt really see everything if you know what I mean. It's comparable to watching a game or concert on TV vs. watching it live. 

Reds began to rock back and forth fucking his face. She shivered in delight every time his tongue touched her clit. I was concerned that she was getting too rough, but no one was complaining. Finally, Reds threw back her head and arched her back and it was Niagara Falls. Linford‚Äôs face looked like a glazed chocolate donut and his bed was soaked. 

The Punishment

I should've told Reds "Don't have an orgasm." Again, unlike porn, someone (me) had to clean-up that mess. Remember I told you that no good deed goes unpunished. 

Was she acting? Who knows? Who cares? All I know is that I got my money‚Äôs worth., PERMALINK: /r/opiateswriters/comments/l1q4hg/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished/

The pseudo Russian arms expert commented "You put cheap flashlight made in Chinese slave factory so enemy know where to shoot. What next? You put sex dildo on top to fuck your ass?"

TITLE: Falling Out, POST BODY: I've been clean for over 80 days, but the cravings got to be too much and I got a half G. I snorted a tiny line about a half inch long and medium fatness. Five minutes later, I went down. On the way down, I bashed my face into the heating radiator. I woke up on the floor three hours later. I looked like I just had my ass kicked with a black eye and a gash over my eyebrow and blood everywhere. I was surprised that such a small amount of heroin snorted, not banged, could put me down.

What's up with that?, PERMALINK: /r/OpiateChurch/comments/l3wn1c/falling_out/

TITLE: Hospital Pain Killer, POST BODY: I've been in hospital for the last four days for kidney stones and they have been giving me their good drugs. I get a shot of dilaudid every four hours and then a 30 of pharma oxycodone as needed. At bedtime, I can ask for a sleeping pill. AlI I need is a fat shot of heroin to top off, but the dboy won't deliver to my hospital room. Alternatively, to get a good nod, I can save the 30s until I get three and then snort 90mg of oxycodone, but the nurse watches to make sure that I swallow., PERMALINK: /r/OpiateChurch/comments/l62vqo/hospital_pain_killer/

Ok weird fetish.So I posted on r/meth and promptly got banned, but I did meet 3 meth girls and I did get some vids. So it was worth it. What happened next refreshed my belief in God.

I was lusting after a meth girl (Satan), but I met a remarkable woman with a kind and caring heart, a radiant soul and a creative spirit. The Lord turned my sin into a blessing.

TITLE: Falling Out on the Bus was a Good Thing, POST BODY: I was clean for 40 days and I had some Christmas money so I figured why not? I met my dope boy and snorted a couple lines in his car and it felt so good. I called my meth girl and let dope boy talk to her (I don't know much about meth girls; maybe someone can get me up to speed) and then I hopped the bus for a short 3 mile ride home. 

Next thing I know I'm waking up on the bus with 3 bus drivers yelling at me to get off the bus because it was the end of the line. Fuck I could barely see. They helped off the bus and let me sit my ass down. Then came the firemen asking me what I took and wanting to take me to the hospital. I said "No hospital" and they said "Either you go to the hospital or we're calling the cops because you're not cooperating." I had two grams in my pocket and the hospital sounded better than jail. The firemen went through my pockets and took my blade. They found my dope and one dick still wanted to call the cops.

I woke up in the hospital and of course they found opiates in my system and gave me the lecture about drinking and opiates. Then came the bad news - I had sepsis and I could've died. Mother of Christ I knew that I shouldn't have shared needles with that filthy dope girl. God only knows how many dirty dicks were rammed up her.

Anyway the Lord had mercy and the sepsis cleared up with some antibiotics. And the best thing was the dope was still in my pocket. True story., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/lymydc/falling_out_on_the_bus_was_a_good_thing/

TITLE: Only a Meth Girl Would Want a Dope Boy, POST BODY: I was always intrigued by meth people, especially meth girls. I liked the meth stories about marathon sexcapes and I liked to watch cloud blowing.

I posted on r/meth that I had an obsession for meth girls and five girls responded, but I only really clicked with one. Ok then game on. BTW, I was banned from r/meth for that post because it's not r/LoveConnection.

At first we were just feeling each other out like any new relationship, but things heated up quickly. She was perfect. She was a real meth girl and not like the r/FuckingTweakers girls. We talked for hours which is a lot for a dope boy. She talked so fast that I could barely understand her and she switched to French sometimes which I couldn't understand at all (Tish you spoke French).

One day we were ready to "consummate" our relationship on Snap when I heard people speaking French. I could tell by the tone of their voices that something was wrong. My poor, sweet meth girl was being arrested by French talking cops. Hey just my luck. So close.

My meth girl was released on a PR bond, but the mood was lost. Now I'm trying to kick and save some money so that I can go see my meth girl IRL. WISH ME LUCK ON KICKING., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/lzfkty/only_a_meth_girl_would_want_a_dope_boy/

TITLE: Trap House Drama, POST BODY: My friend, Spanish, swung by and said "Yo Holmes, I'm making a run. You want to come?" So I jumped in his Honda Civic (why do Spanish people always have Hondas or Toyotas?) and off we went to ye ole trap house.

We pull up and I told Spanish that I was staying in the car because I didn't want to deal with the crack bitches that are always hanging around ready to take my money. So dboy comes out to the car and serves me and I get well and I continue to wait for Spanish who was smoking crack inside.

Dboy's old lady, who I've feuding with,  comes to the car and offers me an orange and a water bottle. She was drunk and cracked-up, but always a practical man, I ate the orange and drank the water. Then she asked me to come sit next to her.

She said "I care about you, but last time it took me 20 minutes and all my narcan to bring you back. I can't have you dying in the house. You need to tune back on your shots." So we were talking and she was drinking and smoking and everyone was having a good time.

My meth girl called and I went outside to take her call. (Sorry I nodded out right here). I was talking to meth girl and I said "she went too far. "

Somehow, dboy's girl thinks that I'm talking about her. She starts screaming at me that I'm a snitch and I'm going to get a bullet in my brain and they'll take me down easy. JFC, I was staying in the car to avoid this shit. I was about to tell her to shut her friggin mouth, but Spanish grabbed me and hustled me to the car.

Now tell me how I made this up., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/m3uyie/trap_house_drama/

Clyde and Jimmy went to the fence with some stolen electronics. While there, they decided to rob the fence when he opened his safe to pay them. Clyde hits the fence and he goes down. Jimmy starts loading up the cash while Clyde goes into the bedroom.

The fence's GF was in bed and Clyde decided he was going to take some white pussy too. Jimmy was like "let's go man. We made a lot of noise", but he only hears some grunting in the bedroom. Jimmy goes into the bedroom and says "Quit playing with that girl. That's not what we're here for. Get the fuck off her. Fuck you I'm gone." Clyde pulls up his pants and off they went.

TITLE: Caveat Emptor: Scammers, POST BODY: This topic has been beaten to death, but I hate scammers (yes, I know it's a sin to hate). My GF was just scammed. If I was a real man, I would hunt down the motherfucker and ahh .. (Mods I am being good) remind him that it's wrong to scam. Mods: I am not inciting violence.

While I'm on a rant, I want to call out these keyboard warriors, one of which wrote to me "I am going to ram my BBC up your mama's ass". Mods: I am only quoting what he posted on r/opiates. I usually do not let these keyboard warriors bother me, but this cocksucker went too far. My mother has been dead for several years so it really bothered me.

Now, if he had said something like that IRL, I would have had to remind him that it's not nice to say those sort of things about someone's mother. In fact there is no way that he would say that IRL because of the consequences, but these cowardly motherfuckers are nice and secure in mommy's basement protected from my wrath.

The bottom line is that anyone dealing on the internet is a scammer. The end.

That makes two deaths in three weeks. They tried to revive the dead guy, but they couldn't bring him back. Part of the reason is that they used their last Narcan bringing back yours truly.

This guy had a wife and a family to support. He was a better man than me.  I feel like a POS that I'm alive and he's dead. They should've let me go and saved that Narcan for him.

TITLE: My Friend Ripped-Off the Dboys and They are Pissed, POST BODY: My friend, let's call him Spanish, ripped-off the dboys. They gave him a package that he was supposed to turn over, but he did it all up instead. Now the dBoys want their money, but Spanish doesn't have it.

I called the main dBoy and asked him if Spanish could repay his debt on an installment plan, but the answer was NO! The dBoy said that he wanted to make an example out of Spanish to send a message and that frankly he didn't care about the money.

My problem is that Spanish asked me if he could hide-out at my place. I ran this by my girl and she said "FUCK NO!" I want to be a good friend to Spanish, but these dBoys don't play. 

What do you guys think I should do?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/mg81w6/my_friend_rippedoff_the_dboys_and_they_are_pissed/

TITLE: I'm Kicking for GOOD this Time, POST BODY: I'm sick of giving the dBoy all my money. I want to save my money for good things like vacations, seeing my family, new clothes and shoes and better, fresh food than the processed, canned food from the food Bank.

I have gaba, lope, pepto, tylenol, Gatorade and soup and crackers. The only thing that I don't have is benzos. I'm doing it this time. Other people here have kicked for good and I can do it too.

Edit 1: I know that I joke around a lot on r/opiates, but I am truly overwhelmed by all the support.

Edit 2: I failed. In typical junkie fashion, I'm going to rationalize that is was not my fault. It was the fault of the IRS. I woke up this morning to an email that the IRS had deposited my income tax refund. So here I was, dope sick and with a stack in my bank account. No junkie could has resisted. No junkie.

I am ashamed that I let everyone down, but the worse shame is that I let myself down.  r/opiates is a real community and not simply a subreddit. There is nothing more to say except that I'm a big pussy with no self discipline. Thanks again., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/mhzjke/im_kicking_for_good_this_time/

TITLE: The pressure from Social Media is ruining girl's self esteem, POST BODY: I saw this title on another post and it's absolutely true. I (M 57) am dating a super girl (F 27) and she thinks that she is not pretty or too fat or has some other minor flaw, but the truth is she is a beautiful girl with a good heart full of love and a soaring, creative spirit.

I grew-up before social media, so I see it for what it is - just more propaganda to get your money. I try to explain that these girls on r/gonewild have had multiple plastic surgeries, sometimes to the point of hurting their health. They starve themselves and damage their internal organs and alimentary canal all in pursuit of some wrong-headed realization of feminine beauty. Frankly, I don't find these girls particularly attractive. They are too skinny for me.

TITLE: Everyday I (57 M) become older and uglier while she (F 27) grows in beauty and grace, POST BODY: I know it's childish, but I'm jealous of my GF. She's at the age where a woman grows in beauty and grace and sexiness, while I'm at the age where a person begins to breakdown. She was pretty to start with and now she's absolutely stunning. I'm sure that she could be a model if she was taller. 

Our relationship has progressed.to the point that I'd love her if she was 300 lbs and butt-face ugly.  Frankly, I'd prefer that. I don't want her to be so pretty because I won't be able to keep her. I know that sounds sexist, but please don't blast me. She reassures me that she's "not going anywhere" and my heart swells with love for her, but still that little devil whispers in my ear.

I thought it would be a good time to kick or at least detox. You guys know the Hell, but I was feeling better on Day 3 and could finally eat. I was thrashing around in bed after not sleeping for 3 nights when there was a knock on my door.  Guess who - dBoy

You know the drill. I was thanking God when he put out a "taste" and I immediately felt so much better. So now I'm back on the crazy train and scheming how to generate some quick cash.

TITLE: INVASION OF THE CICADAS - Satan's Pet, POST BODY: ECP people know about the current invasion of the cicadas. Cicadas are large bugs about the size of a man's thumb. They are harmless: they don't bite, they don't sting, they don't eat your food or any food at all and some people eat them dipped in chocolate. I know you are asking "why is that crazy Metro posting about bugs on r/opiates?", but stay with me now.

Interestingly, cicadas only emerge from the ground every 17 years to mate. Again, not so bad as bugs go. The problem is that they somehow time it so that all the cicadas emerge at once. That's right - all 10 billion cicadas dig their way out every 17 years. This causes two problems. First they can fly and they are EVERYWHERE - on your clothes, in your bed, swimming in your toilet and crawling up your ass. Second, they make a mating call by rubbing their "parts" together. Again, not so bad until all 10 trillion sound-off at once. It's a sound that is hard to describe. I would liken it to the the "band of demons" on that song "The Devil Went Down to Georgia - They made an evil hiss and it sounded something like this..." Almost done now.

Ok, Metro you silly fuck, you can live with it for a month, but this time the cicadas went too far. I have a glass plate that I use to hot plate like the coke people do. I remove my plate from the microwave and GD but two horny cicadas were fucking and sucking (do cicadas suck?) and getting high right on my dope plate. I was so pissed-off that I neglected to snap a pic of their horny asses. 

It must've been a sign from God.  I'm kicking in the AM., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/nlbcj5/invasion_of_the_cicadas_satans_pet/

TITLE: Ghosted by my sexting partner, POST BODY: I, an American man, have been sexting with a Canadian woman for the last five months. I enjoyed it and she said that she enjoyed sexting too. She especially liked making a man cum. She also liked being called pretty and sexy during our very hot sessions. Everything seemed hunky-dory or so I thought. Then last week she just ghosted me out of nowhere. JUST GONE, GONE, GONE.

At first, I thought that she was just very busy with work or family matters. Then came the serious worrying about hospital or jail. Finally, I was simply bewildered. The only reasonable explanation was that her SO (she told me that she didn't have a SO) had caught her in "flagrante delicto" so to speak.

At this point, I will just stop texting her. She knows where I live if she wants to contact me. If not, then I'll just pick-up my pieces and go home. This ghosting is extremely rude; even a simple "fuck-off" is preferable.

TITLE: Everyone That I Meet is Somehow Connected to Drugs and It's Getting Me Down, POST BODY: Every new friend or acquaintance I meet is somehow connected to drugs. My ex wife, sexting GF, ex GF, ex ex GF, drinking buddy, workout buddy, etc., I've met through drugs, except for Church Girl, and you how that went.

My question: how do you meet new people? I'm not looking for "poor, poor, pitiful me" or maybe I am., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ocm1t9/everyone_that_i_meet_is_somehow_connected_to/

BODY: I went the "drinking and bars route" some years back and it was OK until I ended up in rehab to stay out of prison, which was entirely my fault. With all the taxis and Ubers and Lyfts these days, there is absolutely no reason to drive drunk. I might try that route again, though. I mean, it was kinda fun.

 I tried online dating, but a local guy able to make a booty call at 3AM will always beat-out an online guy like me who is 500 miles away.

I tried "being setup" through friends or family, but that's always sticky if things don't work-out. Heck, even my ex-wife tried to set me up with one of her friends. 

Thanks for your reply. These are all good ideas. It MUST be my sorry ass.

What's even worse is that the mods are then open to the idea that not only are you as good as them, you might be even better than them. So, do you see their dilemma?

TITLE: Ghoster Contacted Me After 40 Days, POST BODY: After 40 days of no contact, my online GF contacted me and, fool that I am, I accepted her DM. She apologized for ghosting me and explained that she had fallen in love with her roommate.

To her credit, she didn't string me along (much); she was a stand-up woman and this wasn't really a surprise. Frankly, an online guy can't compete with a local guy, especially if his bed is just on the other side of the wall.  Nevertheless, she could've handled it better and NOT ghosted me for 40 days to "sort out her feelings."

My question: what did you take away from being ghosted? Maybe that will help me., PERMALINK: /r/ghosting/comments/ocoh4u/ghoster_contacted_me_after_40_days/

BODY: Princess, first thank you for replying. You always have good advice.

AA/NA - I did AA/NA and I liked it, but SOME PEOPLE turned me off after 6 months or so. I felt that guys just wanted to get their attendance cards signed and were not serious about recovery.  Also this 13th step business was - ah inappropriate. These poor women just want to get well to get their kids back and asshole is trying to trick her in love at her most vulnerable point. It makes me ashamed to be a man. SMH. 

RELIGION - I am Catholic and I love the church, but, again, these pervo priests turned me off. There was one priest that taught me religion in Catholic high school who sucked-off 15 year old boys (not me, I guess that I was too ugly). Anyway, one poor kid burned-off his dick because of guilt and shame and fire and brimstone. You can Google the priest: Father Gilberti.

Nature - Hey I was a Boy Scout and the Scout Leader got me too, so that's ruined.

Online Dating - yeah another big mess. I'm not ready to share that one yet.

You might have discerned a pattern: I'm letting other people ruin things for me. The therapists say this a thousand times and in my case it's true:  I need to work on myself first. 

So that's my plan. What do you think?

BODY: I like the ‚ìÇÔ∏èetro. I think I'll use it.

You're right about the money consequences. For example, I rent my house and stay in the garage so I can buy fentadope. It's not that bad. My garage has small bathroom including a shower so I don't disturb my tenants.  I have internet, AC and heat, but it's not properly insulated. The drug people like my garage because we can get high in peace, but no way I can entertain normies. Also I still don't have a car since I lost it in divorce, but I'm blowing a couple stacks a month.

There are also health consequences from low testosterone. I'm especially worried about bone and muscle loss, among other things. It's just that I love, and I'm using love literally, that sweet, sweet opiate high. "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

BODY: Good post. The problem and the solution will come from big pharma.  Hear me out before down voting me.

Pharma must find a drug (medicines are drugs too) that alleviates pain like opiates, but does not have the negative side effects.


My question to all the chronic pain sufferers is will you miss the opiate high? Will you still crave that sweet relaxation of the mind, body and dare I say, spirit?

So dig deep before you answer.

TITLE: I Live in the Garage and Rent Out my House, POST BODY: When my mom passed, I bought a house with my inheritance, which was one of my smarter moves. The house has a detached garage and I put a small bathroom and kitchen in the garage. Now I live in the garage and rent out my house so that I have more money for you know what.

The problem is that my normie friends and family ask 1) why do I live in the garage and 2) why do I still have no money? Also normie girls don't like my garage bedroom, although party girls don't seem to mind.

Should I not renew the lease and move into my house or should I just say "fuck it" and stay high in my garage?

Also why are normie girls so judgemental?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ouzykc/i_live_in_the_garage_and_rent_out_my_house/

Now that I'm on opiates, the grass can grow like corn stalks, the painting can wait and I no longer hear the wife's incessant bitching and blabbering about only God knows what. Best of all, I no longer fear the reaper. It's like that song: the water changed into cherry wine.

TITLE: The Shah, Spanish and Me: Broke and Sick on a Saturday Night and Politics, POST BODY: I thought r/opiates would like an interesting story so here goes nothing and no, I did not make this up. I'm sorry this is so long, but maybe someone will like it.

My friend, Spanish, called me late on a Saturday night. We were both broke and sick and getting desperate, but Spanish had a car and I managed to scrape-up $10 gas money.

Spanish knows a ton of drug people so he was working his phone trying to scare-up a front for at least a dub - just something that we could both get well. Finally, a guy nicknamed "The Shah" (as in the Shah of Iran) answered and said that he was gambling at the MGM and to pick him up. If he's gambling, then he must have money. COOL BEANS.

Spanish tells Shah to meet us at the MGM's main entrance. So we're waiting there for 20 minutes, but for some reason, Shah couldn't find it. Think about that; Shah couldn't even find the MGM main entrance. I was beginning to think that Shah was an asshole, but nevermind, he had money.

God only knows how or why, but Shah somehow winds up in the parking garage. No problem. We drive into the parking garage on level 4, but Shah was on level 3. Spanish tells Shah to take the elevator to level 4 and we'd meet him at the elevators. Now one would think easy-peasy, but NOOO, again Shah couldn't even go up one story. 

This fiasco was going on over an hour and we were both becoming increasingly desperate.  Finally, Spanish tells Shah to go out to the street and meet us where the security guard was sleeping in his truck, but with his big yellow strobe light flashing. At last we pick-up Shah and off we go to dboy's apartment to score with Shah's money. We looked like a pack of hungry jackals at 2:00 am, so only Spanish went in.

While waiting for Spanish, Shah and I made small talk and he told me that was from Afghanistan. Then he brags how proud he was that the Taliban defeated America and how Americans were weak and cowardly. I asked him to change the subject, but he kept on with his bull shit.

Ok, I get it. A better man would've punched him right in the back of his big, fat head (I was sitting in the back seat), but I wanted to get well and it was his money after all, so I just shut-up. So tell me AITA?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/p2u37o/the_shah_spanish_and_me_broke_and_sick_on_a/

TITLE: She Said "No Because You Drive Me Crazy", POST BODY: Ladies and Gentlemen, perhaps you could help me with advice and shed some light on my situation.

 There is a girl, let's call her Jane, who is more than a FWB but less than a GF. Being Friday the 13th, I thought that this is a good night for a date. So I called Jane and asked her out for a drink or maybe just Starbucks and she said NO! Note: I'm jealous of all these guys where the girl says YES!

I asked her why and, this is a quote: "Because you drive me crazy" and I don't think she meant it in a good way. I mean, I was ready to take her out, pick her up and pay for everything all with no expectations other than a kiss and a hug and a butt touch.

So my dear girls and boys, WTF am I doing wrong?

Edit 1: Jane just called me back and said that she would think about it. The games people play.

Edit 2: I spoke with Jane again and I think she's going to give me a chance. The conversatione went like this:

Jane: "You live in a garage"

Me: "That's only temporary"

Jane: "You don't have a car"

Me: "I am buying one next week"

Jane: "You're lazy in bed"

Me: "I've been working out and losing weight"

Jane: "You stand me up"

Me: "I have dope"

Jane: "Maybe" which means yes, PERMALINK: /r/dating_advice/comments/p3nn2u/she_said_no_because_you_drive_me_crazy/

Me: "I'll be good"

Jane: "You live in a garage"

Jane: "You don't have a car"

Me: "I am buying one next week"

Jane: "You're lazy in bed"

Me: "I've been working out and losing weight"

Jane: "You stand me up after I get ready"

Jane: "You have a little dick"

TITLE: Druggie Girls are Meaner than Normie Girls, POST BODY: I know that I'll be down voted to infinity, but druggie girls are meaner than normie girls. I'll give you an example.

Last night about 2:00 am, I got a call from a druggie girl, let's call her Michelle. Michelle asked me if I had any stuff and I said "I have a little." Then she said "I have the house to myself. Why don't you come over and spend some time with me?" Well, I was already nodding and really didn't want to get cleaned-up and dressed, so I very politely declined.

Oh man, you'd think that I had stabbed her in the back. She was screaming and cussing at me like I was the spawn of Satan. All that didn't really bother me, but then she said "If you were a real man, you'd come over and lick the jelly." No wonder guys turn into incels! I mean that really hurt. 

Back to my original point, a normie girl would've never said something so mean and hurtful, but a druggie girl jumped right into the pool. Also, the druggie girls don't give a damn about me. They just want my stuff. So I stand by my statement: Druggie girls are meaner than normie girls.

Edit 1: Now I'm crying my eyes out. Thanks a lot r/opiates for heaping it on me. Boo-hoo.

Edit 2: Guys, sorry for my miscommunication.  This post is not about "jelly". It's about me being used. My statement is that a normie girl would've never used me for "sharing" and then attacked me for not being a "real man." I agree that druggies are meaner than normies and I stand by that fact.

TITLE: Physical Addiction vs. Mental Addiction is Bunkum and Balderdash, POST BODY: People keep spouting that there is a solid distinction between physical addiction and mental or addiction of the mind. This is simply untrue and here's why.

Most philosophers and religious leaders teach that the mind and body are separate and distinct entities (dualism). However Gilbert Ryle (The Ghost in the Machine) wrote that the mind and body are not separate entities and that the mind is simply a set of learned behaviors, although very complex learned behaviors, which satisfy the older reptilian brain that had two overriding directives: self-preservation and continuance of the species.

I cut my left calf three days ago. A quick trip to the ER and 19 staples and two Tylenol and I was good to go. The cut is not infected and I've kept it bandaged and Neosporin and  antibiotics pills every day. I cut my leg on a fence post, so there were lots of germs.

In the old days, I'd just take the stitches out myself after the wound closed, but I'm unsure about these staples. Can I remove them at home with needle nose pliers? I know some doctors will cringe at that. Thanks in advance., PERMALINK: /r/AskDocs/comments/py1oey/removing_staples_myself_at_home/

TITLE: My Messed Up Life, POST BODY: I'm still working on my compartment syndrome story, but here is a short story about my messed-up life.¬†

I was nodding at home all comfy and watching West World when someone was banging on my front door, like police banging. The guy who lived in my apartment before me was a registered violent sex offender so visits from the local and state police were not uncommon, but the police usually come early in the AM. I peek-holed and saw that it was not the police; worse - it was Shelly

Shelly and I have a long history of a very rocky relationship including physical fights and police called by the neighbors. Shelly is a beautiful woman, cute face, large breasts and hips and very juicy and way above my pay grade. I knew that she would not just go away, so I let her in because last time that I tried to ignore her, she smashed my window. I had to pay $125 for the handyman to replace the glass, which was a special thick, green-tinted glass that he had to order. Also, my landlady was pissed and wanted to kick me out.

First thing I did was make sure that my indoor camera was working. Shelly has lied to the police before and told them that I hit and pushed her when I did not, so I needed to protect myself with video evidence. Once inside, first thing Shelly whipped out her stem and took a blast, which I declined because of my crack and meth paranoia. I went back to my bedroom and tried to resume watching West World, but Shelly was not having that. She was rooting around in the kitchen and found my handle of Evan Williams Old Kentucky Bourbon. I know that some people won‚Äôt drink bottom shelf, but I can buy a handle of Evan Williams green label for only $20, which is half the price of Jack Daniels Old No. 7. She chugged directly from the bottle and I just SMH. Hey, girl did you hear about COVID? Please get a glass.

Shelly started begging me for my fentadope, so I gave her a couple lines. Next thing I know, Shelly girl is butter-ball naked. She said to me ‚ÄúLick the jelly‚Äù; she speaks like that saying ‚Äúthe‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmy‚Äù. I mean, she could‚Äôve asked nicer than that or at least kissed me first.

I replied that that was not a good idea with COVID and all. I think that I might have said something like ‚Äúewww‚Äù too. Also, Shelly tricks and I‚Äôm not big on getting my white wings. From reading Reddit sex subs, I know that white wings are some other guys‚Äô kinks. I wish that I could be a cool, freaky, sexy guy like those men, but I'm not. SIGH.

After declining Shelly‚Äôs snack, she said ‚Äúthen you have to fuck me‚Äù, which is a BIG waste of time and energy for me because like most opiate guys, I cannot finish. Plus, Shelly won‚Äôt let me use rubbers. Then she started-in on me saying the most cruel and hurtful things. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a man. You can‚Äôt fuck me and you won‚Äôt eat me out. You wasted 10 years of my youth. I hate you. Blah, blah blah, bitch, bitch, bitch.‚Äù If I was a real man, I would not have taken all that, but you know me. In her defense, like any relationship, it‚Äôs a lot more complicated with screw-ups on both sides, but I won‚Äôt go there now.

I knew that I was only moments away from a big fight, so I had to think fast. I said to her: ‚ÄúShelly baby girl, get in the bed and I‚Äôll cuddle you‚Äù and I gave her some more fentadope. That settled her down and she relaxed in the bed with me. Now Shelly is a BBW, topping out at 190 pounds, but she‚Äôs 5‚Äô9‚Äù and carries her weight well. On the downside, she takes up the whole bed and cusses, snores and farts like a drunken sailor and smokes and eats in bed too. Finally, I had enough and as soon as she fell asleep, I moved to the couch and had a restful night's sleep.

I like to read stories too. Cmon, let's hear some of your stories., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/q1y3iv/my_messed_up_life/

TITLE: Heroin Nearly Cost Me My Life, POST BODY: Compartment Syndrome Part 1

Following up on my pic, here's the story of how I got compartment syndrome.

I was in another codependent, toxic relationship with Mona, but no surprise there. We were fighting continually and sooner or later, it was bound to explode and I should've GTFO.

One common thread in my dysfunctional relationships is substance abuse, which is why I've posted in this sub. Anyway, Mona and I were drinking and drugging one evening when things went totally out of control. This time the consequences were severe, but not wholly unexpected.

Mona and I were tussling (note I wrote "tussling" and not "beating the shit") when she grabbed the big butcher knife. This is not a little steak knife. I was afraid of this knife. I guess you can say that any real man should be able to easily disarm a woman and I'm a wimp. You might be right.

Mona came flying at me with that big, scary butcher knife. My instincts kicked-in and I parried the knife with my right, forcing the blade down and into my leg. In hindsight, maybe she was not going to stab me and I actually caused the stabbing. I'm really not sure. I know that I was shocked when the knife entered me. Strange thing, but pain was indescribably absent, nothing, no pain at all.

I am still ashamed of what I did next. I hit her hard with my left. I hit her with a closed fist. I hit her with everything I had. I hit her with malice and anger. No, not anger, wrath. I wanted to hurt her. I know that a lot of guys say that a man should never hit a woman. I agree with you.

But before you judge me, I want to say that I was in extreme crisis. I knew that I would not survive if she plunged that knife into my chest. It's impossible to understand unless you've been in that situation. I still regret that I hit a 90 pound woman. It wasn't right and I make no excuses, but I am trying to offer an explanation. I want to blame the drugs, but the fact of the matter is that hurting people is never a good thing and I knew that.¬†

I was in better shape back then and a lot stronger. When I hit her she just slithered down the wall, but I had bigger problems. Bright red blood was squirting out with every heartbeat. My femoral artery had been cut and I was rapidly bleeding out.¬†

[end of part 1]

Edit 1: I was arrested for DV, convicted and sentenced to jail and classes. The classes were good. Jail was not so good, but I did meet new plugs., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/q29dz1/heroin_nearly_cost_me_my_life/

TITLE: Refunds in the Dope Game, POST BODY: Settle an disagreement. Where I roll, there are no cash refunds in the dope game. The worst was some cam girl sold me makeup powder.  I know, WTF are you doing buying from white cam girls? You know why. I was stupid for her slutty ass, although I'd probably not know what to do with her if I did get her. Other people say there are refunds in the dope game. What say you?

Edit 1: Some people are espousing violence. I'm not hitting a woman over some dope and if I'm the only one, then so be it.

Edit 2: I haven't always lived a good life. I'm no Angel. Lying, cheating and stealing are wrong, but one of the worst sins is hurting people, especially defenseless people.

There will be no winners in this war. The risks are very high and the reward is just one small island. I don't get it. Besides, China and USA are trading partners and used to be friends. Why does China want war? I also must point out that China has been peaceful and hasn't fought a war in over 70 years. Someone set me straight here.

Edit 1. Thank you to all my fellow Redditors. This is an excellent discussion and it will take me few days to digest it all. Let's say that I was educated. I pray that this conflict can be resolved peacefully.

TITLE: Hospital Searched Me - Keep Your Dope in Your Little Watch Pocket, POST BODY: I was carted off to the ER when I fucked up my leg and the front desk nurse rifled through my pockets before admitting me. I had a tiny little Victorinox Swiss Army knife - the smallest one they make. This knife had an one inch blade, a finger nail file/screw driver, a tooth pick and tweezers, but I really liked the baby scissors that I used to cut straws and bags. This knife was a toy, but they confiscated it anyway as contraband. I liked that baby knife, besides it cost $12.

What the nurse did not find was my half gram of dope in my Levis watch pocket. Lots of people hide their dope every which where, including their prison wallet, but I like to be able to get to my dope fast in case I must eat it. So Nurse Ratched searches me like a homo-sexual prison guard, but the witch didn't find my dope. SCORE!

After they stapled me up, they had me sit in a room for a couple hours before they would release me. They gave me a drink and a straw while I waited, so I did what every good junky would; I used my teeth to cut the straw and you know the rest.

Later on the discharge doctor came in to look me over and to have me sign some papers and give me an antibiotics prescription. I guess she noticed that I was high and she asked me if I was always so "out of it" using her doctor-speak. They had already hit me with IV fent and with a couple lines of my dope I was flying. I said that it was a stressful day and could I go home please. And then I ubered away with my dope still in my watch pocket, but without my knife.

TITLE: Intimate Bonding and Dope, POST BODY: I was chatting with my online friend and we were discussing how dope couples can develop strong, intimate bonding. I thought on it for a minute and realized she probably was right.

When you're getting high together, you are exposing your innermost self in a very vulnerable situation. Also you share and care to the point of you getting sick so your SO can stay well. There is a scene in "Dope Sick Love" where the guy does gay for pay to get his girl well.

Then there's the excitement. Every shot can be your last. The adultery people rant about the excitement of cheating. Try scoring dope in the hood. You can be killed, robbed, beaten or arrested. Now that's excitement. That's adrenaline.

Then there are the secrets. Sex used be secret, but now people blab everything about sex every which way on their Tinder first date. You don't do that with dope. It's a real secret.

Lastly, you rely on each other to save one's life or take a charge if it comes down to that. All these things make for very strong intimate bonds. Am I wrong? What do you think?, PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/q8spht/intimate_bonding_and_dope/

I went from senior full stack software engineer pulling $10k/month to volunteering at the mission and scraping by on $2200/month. I couldn't handle IT work anymore - 10 hour days six days/week and 3am code drops. The pressure to deliver was relentless. It got worse during COVID since WFH meant that the managers could call you anytime, even if it wasn't a crisis. I could no longer could keep work and home separated. It was taking a toll on my body and mind. I ballooned to 190 lbs, but now I'm back down to 140 lbs. I was living on Snickers, Cheetos and Diet Coke. Now I eat salads and either fish or chicken.

My self-delusion says that it was the drugs that caused my melt down, but in the back of my mind, I know it was my own damn fault. I get calls and emails everyday from head hunters, but I don't have the ambition to work anymore. I considered other IT roles like testing or user guides and training or scrum master, but I just can't code anymore and I definitely can't handle full-time.

I keep thinking that even if I get totally clean, I'll still be a worthless, lazy slob. I like to think "just put me in rehab and get me clean and I'll be OK", but that's just a lie that I tell myself. So are the drugs the cause or the symptom?  You tell me.

TITLE: Is Mixing Benzos and Dope All That Dangerous?, POST BODY: I've been told that mixing benzos and dope is not near as dangerous as I've been led to believe. One Redditor commented. 

"I do benzos and opiates all the time and I'm fine, never overdosed. Be smart and measure your doses."

Am I wrong to believe that mixing benzos and opiates is unsafe? A little help please.

TITLE: I'm Just a Dweeb with No Self Esteem, POST BODY: Hey Kings,

I was messing with this chick and it was alright. While I was out, she stole my debit card and drained my account of $800. Some guys said to knock the crap out of her. Other guys said to go to the cops. I won't hit a woman over money and I don't hold a chick up to the law, so I sent her some nasty texts, but that was all.

It gets worse. She returned the next weekend and I was right back in the bed with her. What is wrong with me?

TITLE: American Slang with My Indian Colleagues, POST BODY: I'm an American who works in IT with many Indian colleagues. As in any work place, we discuss other things than work and I use American slang frequently. My Indian colleagues either don't understand my American slang or take it literally.

For example, my Sikh friend was having a tiff with another Indian colleague. Now I know that Sikhs carry a little knife, so I said "Dude, pull your blade and tell him: Back off cocksucker before I cut your bitch ass." It didn't go over well. 

My question is: should I cut out the American slang?

Edit 1: If I had said those words to Americans, they'd be howling with laughter. Also when all the guys just worked the last 36 hours in a 10 x 10 foot room, you get close and loose regardless of nationality or race. When your Indian friend just shared his lunch that his wife made special for him, you develop deep bonds. IT guys can confirm all this., PERMALINK: /r/india/comments/qap86h/american_slang_with_my_indian_colleagues/

TITLE: Trouble in Normie Communities Because of What You Posted Here and the Other Drug Subreddits, POST BODY: Does anyone else get in trouble in normie communities because of r/heroin? I posted a perfectly good question about kerosene heaters in a subreddit about advice on heating, ventilation and air conditioning. The garage gets cold in the winter and I need a source of heat.

Instead of advice, I get a lecture about "get off dope and get out of the garage." I'm like "WTF can we please stay on topic?" I get more lecturing. I tried to point out that the mod guide specifically states that a mod cannot abuse an user because of activity in another subreddit and I get muted. What's up with that?

Other times I got banned for using street logic. Some chick in a love subreddit had her panties in a bunch because her boyfriend had pics of his exes on his phone. All sorts of lame advice was flying. I told her "Smash his phone with a hammer. End of problem." Somehow I'm inciting violence. I didn't write hit him; I wrote hit his phone. 

I am interested in other POVs, especially from mods or ex-mods., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/qasoi0/trouble_in_normie_communities_because_of_what_you/

TITLE: Young Meth Girls and Hating Life, POST BODY: I was sitting in my garage doing absolutely nothing. I had no dope, no kratom, no coke, no drink and no money. My ex-wife was bitching about only Jesus knows what, ignoring the old rule that exes can't bitch. I was hating life and counting down the days until I could get high. I was talking with my online girl and that's cool, but she's 1500 miles away and I needed a hug and a kiss.

Wallowing in my despair, I heard a knock on the door. The thing about living in a garage is that people think that they can just pop up. It was this young meth girl and she was cold and crying. (Note to mods, she said she was 18, but I didn't ask for ID). I'm not a barbarian and I don't turn away sobbing meth girls. Call me stupid, but that's not what I do.

Once inside, meth girl whips out her bubble and takes a blast. She offers me a piece, but I don't do meth. So she's getting her tweak on like picking at her face and carpet farming and hearing noises. I just go back to bed. Next thing, meth girl climbs in bed with me. Judge me if you want, but I'm a heterosexual male and I'm hard-coded as we say in IT. So this girl is less than half my age and fucked up too. Call me a dirty old man. Report me to the niceguys subreddit. I make my play and she tells me to get off her because she hasn't eaten for three days and her tummy hurts. A real man would've taken it, but there are still some lines I won't cross. I made her a bowl of oatmeal. Stay with me now. I'm almost done.

We're talking and she says that some üçÜ are going to fuck me up. They are going to put a lock on my garage door and set it on fire and this Jamaican guy has a gun, blah, blah, blah. I say "Who would want to hurt me?" except for some Redditors. She says "All the shit you've done and said over the years has pissed off these guys" Now, I have shorted a couple dboys or gave them fake money, but they shorted me too or sold me Goody powder. It's all in the game, but nothing to get worked up about.

So tell me. Do I need to worry or was that just meth girl talk? Oh, meth girl is still in my bed and I need to get rid of her before I get in trouble.

Edit 1: This meth girl said that she hasn't bathed or changed her clothing in 5 days. I'm worried that she has an odor and is funking up my bed.

Update: Yes, meth girl is still in my bed. I sprayed Febreeze, but I think I'm going to have to burn those sheets. I gave her a T-shirt and my old sweat pants so that I can wash her nasty clothes and I still can't get her stinking ass in the shower. I know this, I'm not paying for her meth. She needs to go out and make money her own "special" way, but no one is going to pay her looking and smelling the way she does. Why does this shit always happen to me? I'll give all my Reddit coins to whomever can answer my question., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/qc2s3j/young_meth_girls_and_hating_life/

TITLE: A Good Thing About This Community Is Respect, POST BODY: I'll say this about r/heroin and some of the other drug communities is that we treat each other respectfully compared to other Reddit communities and disrespectful users are called- out when they forget their manners.

For example, I always see good advice without judgement, like "You are fucking-up, but we've been there and we're here to help and not judge you." That is so rare on Reddit, believe you me. 

Also, the men here treat the women "nicely", compared to other mixed gender communities and vice versa. I'm one of the worst offenders, but in my defense, some of my posts try to inject (pun intended) humor into dark subjects al la comedian Bill Burr. The women who know me IRL or from PMs know that I'm a pretty respectful guy. Furthermore (and women keep me honest), the men here don't flood a chick's inbox just looking to get laid. I mean, we are still men, but there is a a right way to make a pass. And even better, our chicks are cool and they'll mix it up right along with the guys.

So that's my $1.00 √∑ 50 √ó 1., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/qgtdlp/a_good_thing_about_this_community_is_respect/

TITLE: Why I Decided to Give It a Break - I Was in the Dirt and Nearly Passed I Hope that I Can Stay Clean, POST BODY: I've been clean nine days now - yeah me!Physically I'm feeling better day by day. Mentally I'm a basket case. Here's the reason that I decided to give it a rest.

I copped from my regular guy and he warned me that this batch was especially strong. Being the asshole that I am, I ignored his warning. All dboys brag that their stuff is fire anyway. So I chopped out my regular line about one inch long and an eighth inch wide. It was a beautiful early November day and I was nodding outside in the lawn chair and just really getting my groove on. I should've simply stayed inside.

I was lost in my opiate dream and the next thing I know, cops, firemen and EMTs are shouting questions at me. I was told that I was rolling around in the dirt hollering some nonsense and someone, either my ex-wife (Mona), my sometimes GF (Michelle) or a neighbor had called 911.

As fucked up as I was, I somehow managed to stand up and speak. I told the cops that I had been drinking since 4am, but they knew that I was lying. The cops patted me down, but the good Lord had mercy and they did not find the half G in my pocket. Then the cops gave me two choices: 1) go to the hospital or 2) go to jail on a drunk and disorderly charge. The hospital seemed like the better option and off I went in the ambulance.

The nurses and doctors were nice enough until I pissed dirty for opiates, after which I became a POS. The doctor explained that I was fortunate to have survived and that I needed to get help. They gave me some substance abuse literature and discharged me. The substance abuse people called me the following day, but I did not return their telephone call.

So that's it guys. My goal is to stay clean until Thanksgiving. This last OD scared me and I don't want to pass on that way.

The "test for fentanyl" thing was flying around. I stopped testing because fentanyl was in everything and what am I going to do about it? Flush the dope? I don't think so.

 I've ODed several times and I never blamed the dealer. I know that dope is dangerous. I rolls the dice and I takes my chances. I try to mitigate the danger with "fix with a friend and have Narcan" but still the danger is real.

TITLE: Indian English to Avoid in the USA, POST BODY: Working in IT, I hear a lot of Indian English. Here's some phrases to avoid while working with your American colleagues. 

- Do the needful: This phrase implies that I know WTF you want. It also is insulting, presumptuous and condescending. All I really NEED to do is die and pay taxes. 

- Please revert: Revert means to return to an earlier state as in "Please rollback the code and revert to release 1.1". Instead use "Please reply".

- Take a system dump: Do you mean download the server logs and figure out what's wrong with my crappy software? Yeah, right after my system takes a dump.

- Out of station: Just say "I'm going home".

- Do one thing: and then rattle-off 10 tasks. Wait, you said ONE thing. This is my favorite.

- Updation: What the heck? Is that even a word? Just say "update".

Best luck dealing with Americans.

Edit 1: I quit. You guys win. Please do the needful.

Edit 2: Guys settle down. None of these phrases are grammatically incorrect. I never said that. What they are is an archaic holdover from when the British ruled your country. Plus no one outside India and IT knows what they really mean. For example, "out of station" would be taken literally as in you are standing outside the train station. Furthermore, why in the world would you'd want to continue using the outdated language of your oppressors? Tell me that.

Edit 3: Great discussion, guys. I want to thank everyone who contributed, even Pubes. Although we weren't always cordial, I still enjoyed the thread and I learned a lot. This is how we understand and accept other cultures. Also, thank you to the mods who let this thread run. Live long and prosper. Your American friend, Metro.

Addendum: A few comments brought up some more words that don't mean what you think they mean. They are perfectly good words, but don't use them in the USA unless you really mean it.

- Rubber: instead use eraser unless you're having sex.

- Florida Man: a Florida Man is a crazy, stupid, meth head, dirty white trash criminal that always gets caught. Crime is everywhere, Florida has the weirdest criminals despite having the harshest law enforcement.

- Pass Out and Got Off: again, perfectly acceptable as in "I passed out at Holi, but damn I got off on bhang, ganja and charas.

- Money Shot: Perfectly acceptable, but don't say it unless you're watching porn., PERMALINK: /r/india/comments/quzlvh/indian_english_to_avoid_in_the_usa/

TITLE: My Miserable Life and It's All My Fault. What's My Best Play, POST BODY: You guys seem to like reading about my misery, so here's a good story.

I was hanging around with my sometimes gf, Michelle, because we're both addicts and also I'm an idiot. DBoy came through and I bought two halves, one for each of us.

So I'm relaxing, watching the game all warm and comfy and just glowing. Michelle rips through her half and starts bugging me for my shit. Here's how it went.

Me: No! I split it equally (I wasn't lying this time). I'm watching the game. Leave me alone.

Her: Do you want me to suck your dick?

Me: No, but you can make me a sandwich

So she makes me a tuna sandwich and I give her a bump and we're both happy.  Then she starts bugging me again and when I said "No", a switch flipped and psycho brat appeared. Michelle starts throwing dishes including flinging stinky tuna fish. So, I start videoing her and she really flips out.

Incredibly, Michelle chomps down on my left hand, drawing first blood. My phone was in my right hand and I had to put it down because psycho brat was chewing through my tendons. Then Michelle threw my phone out the open door. 

Now an alpha male would've punished her, but I've vowed to never hit a woman again. I guess I should sign-up with the incels.  What I did do is grab her by the back of her hair because, well, she was hurting me and I wanted it to stop. She finally released my left hand and I somehow got her out of my garage, screaming about heroin and drugs. Of course the neighbors heard everything and "I had a crazy drug girl" was the local gossip.

I washed and cleaned my bite wound with hydrogen peroxide. God only knows what nasties were lurking in her mouth. Here's the kicker. Michelle calls me three days later and wants to come over. I tell her "No because you bit me". She says that she doesn't remember because she was so fucked up.

Rule. No.1: Never let your money walk.

Rule No. 99: Never fall in love with a junky

Rule No. 100: Call Me Ishmael - Chasing that first high

Captain Ahab spent 40 years hunting Moby Dick, the white whale that crippled him, in a mad quest for vengeance. Starbuck, who was Ahab's first mate, tried to convince Captain Ahab that seeking revenge against a whale was blasphemy (a sin against God) besides being unprofitable. In the end, the white whale destroyed both Ahab and his ship.

The most important rule is: "know when to quit". Obviously Captain Ahab did not follow this rule., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/r5t7vp/rules_of_the_dope_game_what_are_your_rules/

TITLE: What's Up with Meth Paranoia?, POST BODY: My DOC is opiates, but I was hanging with a meth girl because I'm an idiot. Anyway, meth girl starts blabbering that there are people outside my garage at 3am hunting me. Normally, I would be cautious and look outside before opening the door, but I was high on opiates so I just strode right out.

Meth girl starts screaming at me to not go out and she would go outside with me and that the shadow(?) people would hurt me, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OUT THERE; not even the rats and cats were moving. Everything was peaceful and quiet, except for meth girl. So I just go back to my nod while she was still blabbering about God only knows what. What's up with that?

TITLE: Is opiate addiction unavoidable if one uses regularly?, POST BODY: Yes or No please. I say "yes".

Edit 1:  The problem with the distinction of addiction vs. dependency is that it's built upon the philosophical idea of "dualism", which states that the mind and body are separate entities.  Rejection of dualism, i.e. that the mind and body are NOT separate, results in rejection of the entire "addiction is different from dependency" argument, since dualism is the foundation. I realize that this is a difficult concept, especially within the confines of a Reddit post. It took me years to reject dualism, but there is strong scientific evidence that the mind and body are NOT separate, i.e. that the body controls the mind and vice versa. I apologize for my inadequate explanation, but thanks for reading.

Edit 2: I am straight up denying the difference because it's too simplistic and it implies that people like me with a purely psychological dependence are labeled addicts and that in turn leads to the conclusion that I have a mental and moral deficiency, which in fact may be true, but meanwhile the people with just a physical dependency are given a pass. 

The reality of the situation is that the physical and psychological are not separate. I contend that the physical drives the psychological and vice versa. For example, bad kids with ADHD can be cured of their misbehaving with a chemical. How can this be true unless the physical and psychological are one and the same? This is not my opinion; it is a scientifically proven fact. And what about the misbehaving kids without ADHD; are they just bad?, PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/r80s4j/is_opiate_addiction_unavoidable_if_one_uses/

This is a cross post, but I think we have an unique perspective on heroin dealing.

I know that I'll be down voted, but that woman was convicted of distribution of 11 kg of meth. She didn't give a rat's ass about the people who ODed and died or otherwise ruined their lives from her meth. She didn't give a damn about young girls selling themselves to buy her meth and even though she's a mother, she didn't care about the kids going hungry because their parents spent the food money on her meth. She  wasn't a foreigner. She knew that the penalty for drug trafficking is death in Islamic countries. She wasn't a desperate junky. She did it for greed - money. I don't understand why she deserves sympathy.

Edit 1: She was convicted for meth not heroin. I've corrected my original post to replace heroin with meth., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/r89y18/woman_given_the_death_penalty_for_heroin/

TITLE: Sorting and Grouping Items While High on Meth?, POST BODY: I don't know much about meth as my DOC is opiates, but I have been hanging around with some meth users lately and I've noticed a few peculiar behaviors.  For example, this meth girl rearranged the canned food in my cupboard so that the items were sorted alphabetically and grouped by type like an Excel worksheet.  Previously, I had put up the groceries haphazardly. After meth girl, my cupboard started with asparagus and ended with zucchini. 

My questions are:

1) Does meth cause this behavior or does it simply allow an existing behavior (OCD?) to express itself? 

2) Does It seems weird that a guest to my home would do this? She seemed obsessed with creating order from chaos in my cupboard.

Thanks  in advance.

TITLE: My GF has to be rammed up my ass everytime I cop. Does this happen to you? Is this Junky Love?, POST BODY: I don't mean literally. Heck, I might not even complain if it was literal. Everytime I cop she has to go with me, which means that I have to wait while she gets ready - do her makeup, do her hair, etc. - while I'm sick.

Then when I do the deal, she is right on my heels. She follows the dBoy and me when we go into the other room to do business. A lot of dboys don't like her and are like "Control your SO", but they don't say "SO". She has to see EXACTLY how much cash I give and EXACTLY how much dope I get. Then she has to weigh it out EXACTLY half-and-half.

The other night, I had enough and I threw the dope at her and told her "Here take it all SO", but I didn't say "SO". She started with the crocodile tears and now she's mad and I haven't seen her fat ass for three days. I don't know where she's laid-up and I don't care. I'm not chasing after her like she wants me to. Part of this is that she gets her money on the first of the month, so she's gone so that she doesn't have to share with me. Is this True Junky Love, Yes or No?

Addendum: Well she's back at 4am. I thought it was an animal scratching at my door. Now her stinking, crack smoking ass is back in my bed. She's getting playful. I hope she doesn't want to fuck. I can't win for losing. Oh Fuck me. Fuck me!

Now we're fighting.

Her: it's hot in here. Why do you have all these blankets?

Me: you generate heat

Her: what's that suppose to mean?

Me: Fuck me. Fuck me.

TITLE: How Did You Get Started on Dope? Here's My Story, POST BODY: None of us aspired to be junkies. There are usually a specific set of circumstances that lead us to opiate abuse disorder. WTF is a "disorder" anyway? Here's my story.  What's yours?

I wrote previously that my ex-wife had stabbed me. It wasn't her fault. I brought it on myself. I was the worst husband. Like "not coming home for three days laid up with some thot" sort of husband. I lied, cheated and stole from her. These were the days when a BJ was just a crack hit away and I was an unrepentant sinner (Lord have mercy on my soul). I couldn't fathom the amount of pain and sorrow I was causing nor did I care.

Anyway, one day she had enough of my shit and she upped and stabbed me in the leg, cutting my femoral artery. Only by the grace of God and some excellent doctors did I survive with my leg more or less intact. During my recovery, I was flat on my back in traction for over a month in the hospital. It was sheer misery and perhaps penance for my many sins.

At this time, pain was the fifth vital sign and the doctors took that to heart. Morphine, Dilaudid, oxy - they shot me up with them all. Opiates were never my thing as they didn't jive with my life style back then, but that was to change.

I liked the morphine the best. It gave me full-on talking to God hallucinations. Of course, I was soon hooked. I can't blame the doctors. I was a grown man and I knew the dangers of opiate addiction, but it was just too good, too sweet, too relieving. 

The doctors sent me home with a bottle of Percocet and some exercises and that just wasn't cutting it, so I turned to heroin for relief. It wasn't hard to find. I had plenty of street contacts from my previous escapades. I turned to dope and I never turned back. I suffered all the consequences of addiction. You know them: loss of everything good in life. Poor, poor pitiful me.

I'm doing better now. My ex-wife and I are great friends. She helps like a real wife. She chases away druggie girls and sets me up with Christian girls. Note: what am I going to do with a Christian woman? I guess part of it is regret from stabbing me, but I truly believe that she still loves me, but the magic is gone.

I'm doing my best to avoid dope, but it still calls out to me. I can blame my wife or the doctors or my pain or simply life. The truth is it's my own damn fault. So what's your story?, PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/s4iu7m/how_did_you_get_started_on_dope_heres_my_story/

TITLE: Is War Between the USA and China Inevitable?, POST BODY: Many posts on here r/China basically state that the CCP is, for want of a better word, evil and that the PLA will invade Taiwan sooner or later. I'm concerned that war is unavoidable. If so, it's better that we pay with buckets of blood now than barrels of blood later. I'm concerned that the CCP will develop ICBMs and will target American cities with atomic weapons and that we will all be fortunate to survive. 

Mods: I'm not trying to troll or cause drama. This is a genuine concern and my post is thoughtful and well-written.

Edit: A sincere thank you to all participants. This is the way to hold a mature discussion, unlike the rest of Reddit. To the mods, I say thank you for letting my post ride.

Pipe Dreams: The experience of smoking opium caused the user to hallucinate. At the time, these hallucinations were called opium dreams, opium pipe dreams, or pipe dreams. In the 1870s, the term pipe dream came into use to describe the hallucinations a person experienced while under the influence of opium., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/s71zj9/have_you_experienced_pipe_dreams/

I was getting dope sick, so I pinged grumpy dboy and he said that he was "on his way." Now, I know what that means. Besides his fat black ass has only two gears: low and slow. I called him a couple or three or ten times because the minutes were turning into hours and God damn it, I was sick.

Finally grumpy dboy pulls up and gets out of his car. I go to give him a fist bump and he says "Nah" and punches me in the mouth. "Don't you ever blow up my phone again", says he, but damn he had good dope., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/s8oceu/evil_dboys_have_the_best_dope_it_must_be_me/

TITLE: Puking, Puking, Puking - Is This Dope Too Strong For Me?, POST BODY: I've been puking today and I am concerned that this dope is too strong for me. I've done a half G up my nose since yesterday evening  - nothing too crazy. Also I've practice abstinence for the last 20 days so my tolerance is lower.

I'll confess that I did eat six tasty chocolate donuts, which is a bit much. If I lie down, I feel better, but if I move around then my stomach wants to evacuate. It's not a bad puke like WD dry heaves, but still it's annoying plus a waste of chocolate donuts. 

Does anyone have ideas to settle my stomach?. Zofran works for me and I want something similar, but OTC. I have read that holding an alcohol wipe up to your nose helps. Why does this shit always happen to me?

Update: A Redditor recommended Dramamine and that was a big help.

Update 2: Thank you everyone for your kind words. I'm doing much better now. Have a good night., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/saidov/puking_puking_puking_is_this_dope_too_strong_for/

TITLE: Disappointed How Some Of Us Treated "Thirty Years On The Table", POST BODY: It was disgraceful how some of us treated OP of the post "Thirty Years On The Table". Now I'm not naming names, but some comments on this post were way out of line.

Let me preface by stating that I make plenty of jokes on Reddit. Lots of situations in the dope game are humorous and heck, we need to laugh at ourselves. However, some of these comments were deliberately malicious and worse, they were not even funny.

First, to the fellow heroin Redditor who tricked me into believing that he was OP's friend and replied that OP was sentenced to 25 years, I say  "YOU SUCK". You are worse than the dirtiest, filthiest street junky. Street junkies can get cleaned up, but no amount of soap will clean up your ugly soul. Perhaps Junky Jesus will forgive you. 

Next, to the fellow heroin Redditor who stated that prison was a fun place where prisoners lie around and play chess all day, I say "YOU SUCK TOO". How could you not learn during your incarceration that prison is a lonely, evil place where human beings are locked in cages for using a chemical to feel better, if only for a little while? Prison jokes are not funny. Don't drop the soap. Sorry, I couldn't resist.

For the Mods, please don't ban these knuckleheads or delete their posts. Allow them to keep posting so that we are reminded how rotten people can be.

TITLE: Question about Genesis Why Would God Want To Keep Us Ignorant?, POST BODY: I've always had a question about mankind banishment from the Garden. We disobeyed God by aquiring knowledge of good and evil. So we rebelled and were banished from the Garden for acquisition of knowledge.. Why would God want to keep us in this infantile, animalistic, ignorant state? Why would God be so vengeful? So now we're on our own and maybe that's a good thing to rely on ourselves and let God do His God things., PERMALINK: /r/Bible/comments/spti51/question_about_genesis_why_would_god_want_to_keep/

TITLE: Is a DV Conviction a Big Red Flag?, POST BODY: Ok, I'm going to ask. Everybody knows everything about everyone now a days. I have a ten year old conviction for domestic violence. I did my time -30 days in County jail, but only 15 days because I was good. I paid all my fines and court costs. I completed all my DV classes - 18 weeks at 8:30 am Sunday morning. Finally I divorced my wife.

I'm a lot better now after exposure to the criminal justice system. I understand that if I hit a woman for any reason, I'm going to jail for real this time. I'm not Ted Bundy. I just was caught up in a bad situation and didn't know enough to just leave.

Am I eternally red flagged?

Edit: I need to add some context. We were both bad crack heads and violence just comes with that territory. She had already stabbed me once in the leg and I was fighting for my life. I was a bad husband. I think I said something like "You lousy no good excuse for a woman. Get your ugly mug in the car."

Edit 2: I have an enormous scar on my right leg where the surgeon sliced me open because I was bleeding out from the femoral artery. The scar can't be missed. I lie and say that it happened in the military. Some women were really turned off like " you're not touching me with that leg", but most don't give a damn or are simply curious. Fuck me.

BODY: The problem is that these doctors were prescribing opiates like M&amp;Ms, and so many people, including me, got caught up. Over 100,000 Americans OD and no one gives a damn. If those deaths were caused by a virus, Dr. Fauci would be on TV everyday, but no one cares. Just another dead junky. No big deal.

Most of these ODs were caused by fentanyl which came from - you guessed it: China. The Chinese police did nothing to stop the fentanyl despite pleadings from the USA. Order your fent on the dark web and for an extra $50 it will be delivered in three days. Fentanyl is much deadlier than old school heroin. So people were falling out left and right despite Narcan immediately reversing an opiate OD   and being available for free without a prescription. So that's what's up. I suppose when we hit 200,000 ODs someone may pay attention.

Signs: shallow breathing maybe 3 breaths/minute. Normal is at least 12 breaths/minute. Also  noisy breathing. I think it's called the death rattle. Blue lips.

Reversible: yes. Call 911 first then immediately dose with Narcan. Stand back because your patient will come up sick and fighting, but alive. Don't worry about the cops. Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or whom they believe to be injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated.[1] The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted.

BODY: This is a good question. The answer is that Narcan is used up rapidly and the patient may OD again if there's still dope in his system and the Narcan is all used up. Also the hospital has breathing machines if your patient goes into respiratory depression. 

Look you'll get in big trouble if your patient dies and you didn't call 911. You can still have a life after a simple possession charge, but not so much with a murder charge.

When your patient survives an OD, it's because you were prepared, understood what was happening and took swift and immediate action. Now wouldn't that feel good.

TITLE: Toxic Masculinity - Just Another Day in the Dope Game, POST BODY: Some Redditors called me out for toxic masculinity, so I thought to improve myself by first understanding toxic masculinity. I googled "toxic masculinity" and the results are shown below. My issue is that toxic masculinity seems like just another day on the streets. Uh oh

Traits of toxic or unhealthy masculinity can include:

- Unconditional physical toughness

- Physical aggression, fear of emotions

- Discrimination against people that aren't heterosexual

- Hyper independence

- Sexual aggression or violence

- Anti-feminist behavior, PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/sso8x7/toxic_masculinity_just_another_day_in_the_dope/

I especially enjoy your descriptions, like the "Jesus" story. Actually, you'd probably make some money from your stories if you only had an editor who could proof your writing, but still maintain your style. You're a smart girl and you enjoy writing; help a brother out, stim sister. Bang a story out.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: heroin, TIME: 2022-02-14 19:41:52, SCORE: 10
BODY: Thank you for your thoughtful and well-written reply. May I please address your points.

- Calling me out: Thank you for taking the time to help me improve.  Perhaps I have some sexist attitudes, but so do a lot of men and women. May I point out your own sexist attitudes: "Men are selfish." That's most human beings, men and women.

- Rape: Why does rape always come up in these discussions? Rape is an extremely vicious crime and  was punishable with death in some USA states. I'm not a rapist. If a girl wants to go home, I'll put her in a cab. Now I'll be disappointed, but that's a far cry from rape. This idea that 99% of men are rapists or potential rapists is insulting and sexist.

- Double standards: We can all agree that double standards are unfair, but the issue is far bigger than me. You need look no farther than r/spunnsluts where women are referring to themselves as sluts, but you expect me to have this evolved sensibility. Yikes.

Again, thanks.

TITLE: Dope and Poor Beard Growth - Is This Another Thing That Dope Has Screwed Up?, POST BODY: Does anyone have information on dope and beard growth? It has been awfully cold this winter so I have been trying to grow my beard to keep my face warmer. When I was a younger man, I had a full, thick, black beard, but now my beard is light and patchy. Google said that normal beard growth is one-half inch/month. I've been growing my beard for a month and I have about one-eighth inch. I want full-on neck beard.

I know that I joke around, but this is a serious question. I'm worried that this is another thing that dope has fucked up. Thanks., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/su7kk1/dope_and_poor_beard_growth_is_this_another_thing/

I knew the dangers of opiates, but IDGAF. My grief was overwhelming and all-encompasing.

TITLE: The Only Saint Valentine's Gift I Received Was From Christian Girl, POST BODY: You guys and girls blasted me for pursuing a Christian girl. Upon reflection, I agreed that it would be wrong to drag a good, clean girl into our degenerate life style, so I decided to leave her alone.

Bless her sweet heart, but Christian girl was the only person besides my sisters to give me a St. Valentine's gift or card. Even my ex-wife called me. My dope girls however gave me nothing, but frankly I didn't gift them either. Christian girl's gift was only one of those Russell Stover heart-shaped box of chocolates, but it's the thought that counts.

My concern is that Christian girl just showed up at my door and that's not cool. On the other hand, she was looking pretty good, so she must've fixed herself up and was not "just in the neighborhood". Oh, Christian girl was married, but her husband died, so she has plenty of experience with men and fucking and sucking.

So you guys tell me., PERMALINK: /r/heroin/comments/swi9w1/the_only_saint_valentines_gift_i_received_was/

TITLE: My First Clit Piercing, POST BODY: This post isn't that slutty, but it is a confession of a sort. 

When I was a younger man, clit piercing was uncommon or at least less common than it is in 2022. I was running with a couple who were living on the edge - heavy drinking and drugging, swinging, riding fast bikes, etc.

I had seen a few pierced titties, but I had never seen a pierced clit. The husband had complete control and had influenced the wife to get her clit pierced. He was quite proud of his wife's pierced clit. I don't know if it was the pierced clit or the fact that he was so much in control to get his wife to mutilate her body like that.

I had mentioned in passing that I had never seen a pierced clit. Well, that was all that that joker needed to hear. Before I knew what was happening, he told her to show-off to me and her skirt was up, her panties were down and her puss-puss was right in my face. Like RIGHT IN MY FACE.

Now a true slutty confession would tell you something like "we had wild three-way sex all night long", but that didn't happen and there's enough bullshit written by horny 14 year old incels on this subreddit anyway. 

What did happen was that I as usual put my size tens right in my big, fat mouth. I said "OMG that must've hurt like a motherfucker". It took a minute to sink in, but I had just completely and irreversibly killed the mood. I guess that I should've posted this in r/facepalm.

Thanks for reading and at least this story is real., PERMALINK: /r/SluttyConfessions/comments/t1ylyb/my_first_clit_piercing/
