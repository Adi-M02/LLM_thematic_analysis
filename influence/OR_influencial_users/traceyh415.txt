TITLE: This goes along with "when did you cross the line post", POST BODY: You ever have a day where it seems like everyone has left? Where did the time go? Where did my life go? I was just sitting here trying to get a hit. Then, one day I looked up and you were walking away with someone else. There is no one who can stop the pain I feel knowing what we had was real but now you are over me. I see the grayness in my skin and the ashes that burn like the spoon in front of me. Just add water to my reality. I can give you forty units of my time as long as you surrender to the fact the person you knew ran away. 

Most people are running to something. We like to set a goal and reach for our assumptions of happiness. I found this ONE thing that makes me happy. This ONE thing but it kills me just the same. Have you ever seen someone turn blue? In their glassy eyes you see the future. Do I give them what they need to live or do I walk away from life. The decisions we make change the course of galaxy. While we are looking into the stars, other people have their feet on the ground.
Addiction is a selfish bitch. She requires all our attention. Addiction is a jealous lover- do not EVER try to leave or you will face the consequences. I am leaving this time. I am leaving and I am never coming back to this life. You will see the metamorphosis, the evolution of a stronger person. I am can be myself without you. Drugs are an illusion. I am ready to start something real. I will pack up my shitty attitude, my poor dental hygiene, all my fucking resentments and start something brand new.

TITLE: Junkie love poetry, POST BODY: Hey- if you don't like art, don't read it. K? 

When I found myself settled into my routine as a junkie, I found exactly what I wanted in you.
“how do you know all these things about me?” 
Your skin is translucent from the ashing and the scratching all night. You rub your tattoos as if they will bring you luck.  You can barely hold a thought together as you drift off into the absence of burdens. 
“why should I believe you. No one even means what they say.”
you light a cigarette to keep yourself propped up into our conversation. Slowly I lean in. 
“I’m not sure what it is.” 
I say this but I know it is not the truth. I do know. You are exactly what I wanted in life. All the pain you wear illuminated in scars make me see beneath the chemical facade you show to the world. As your breath slows, I hear your heartbeat beneath the ribs that poke at my nose. There is some type of connection that drives me to awareness of the futility of our situation. Your eyes are glassy and pinned. Your lips are dry. Your hands are swollen from the circulation that can not quite navigate your punctures. You see me as a witness. I see myself as a participant in the drama that will ensue. You are my fantasy. Exactly what I wanted was you.

What is it that you feel like you get from Opiates you aren't getting anywhere else?, POST BODY: Besides the rush or the high, opiates serve a place in the life of the user. Pain management, reducing anxiety, etc. For me, I had a ton of emotional pain I was not ready to deal with (ever) but found a way. What is the important role that they play(ed) in your life. I think this role is discounted by society. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1mrvw8/question_of_the_day_the_payoff_what_is_it_that/

TITLE: Am I hooked?, POST BODY: Let me give you some backround- I had a terrible junior varsity injury where I was prescribed four vicodins for tennis elbow. After taking those for three days, I found myself looking in my brother's medicine cabinet for more but all he had was that damn oxycodone and that shit is not any good. So now, flash forward two years later. I had my wisdom teeth pulled and my boyfriend was doling me out the vicodins and after a day I felt really sick to my stomach. I was all sneezy and i could barely hold anything down. Then my boyfriend said If I jacked him off, he would give me another pill. I CANT BELIEVE I DID IT and It turned out I was having a bad reaction to the anethesia, so maybe I wasn't dope sick at all. Now, I feel like such a junkie slut and all I can think about is those two vicodin and how I want AT LEAST one of them right now :(, PERMALINK: /r/opiatescirclejerk/comments/1nsvh8/am_i_hooked/

We also have a huge rise in suicidality among my staff (and friends). I personally could not give two fucks except I have kids. I hate all the peer pressure to consume. I also resented that I could not score drugs on Thanksgiving or Christmas. WTF dealers have holidays. Then a few holidays I waited in line for groceries then sold them for dope money.

TITLE: Dear r/opiates, POST BODY: I am more than willing to attempt to answer your questions and provide useful information. Please- if you suspect your friend is having an overdose, call 911. This is the best advice I can provide. Contacting me is not the best option. Please be safe. This has happened multiple times in recent weeks.

Signs of OD- unresponsive, blue purple lips or nails, trouble breathing etc
Take your knuckles and rub their sternum (breast bone HARD) and say narcan. If they can argue and respond, they might be overmedicated. Stimulate the person and keep them stimulated until they become more responsive or you need to call 911. You do not need to tell 911 the person is ODing. Tell them the person is not breathing or unconscious. The Emts have narcan and it is less likely the cops will come. Also be calm and have no chaos in the background. Less likely EMTs will request police backup , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1o6vbr/dear_ropiates/

TITLE: Some Heroin humor, POST BODY: Things people do not tell you about heroin 
1. Chinga babies- after you have been hooked on opiates for any period of time, you can no longer poop well on your own. When you enter a period of sickness, you may give "birth" to a chinga baby. This is when you suddenly have to poop and an enormous hard poop the length of your colon decides to come out an an inopportune time tearing apart your booty.  

2. Coagulated blood hits- when you cannot find a vein, you may put a syringe clogged with blood and dope to the side. At some later time, a few hours or even a day down the road, you may rethink that hit. I have taken the liquid out, picked out the clots and stuck that right back in my arm. I also did a few of Ben's coagulated blood hits. Ahhh love! 

3. Impotence- Shhh. It's a secret unless you have ever fucked a male addict. After awhile, things do not work in the nether regions. Unless they take a hit of crack or speed. Then, he is too busy looking for white specs on the carpet to get busy. 

4. No periods. Yes ladies, your period may stop. Or you thought it stopped but you actually are pregnant but did not know because you have not had a period. 


5. You may very likely fall asleep with food in you mouth. Amazingly, you may just re chew and swallow that same tasty morsel later. This may be something along the lines of grahamn crackers, a cinnamon roll, etc. As yummy as it sounds, it is WAY better than trying to spit that stuff out with a pasty mouth. 

6. If you nod off next to a person who is also nodding, they may burn you. There is nothing more irritating that waking up to your shirt or the bed on fire. Add a few klonopin in that mix, you may wake up engulfed in flames. 

7. No matter how many times you say you will cuss the connection out, you never will do it. You will wait patiently in the rain for 1-2 hours envisioning acts of violence on said dealer then thank them when they hand you your stuff.

8. If you are selling drugs, everyone hates you. Yes, I know, you also use them so you think it is cool. It is not- they hate you. Trust me. Worse than a junkie is a junkie that then sells drugs- you have betrayed the sacred order of the spoon.

9. If you have never had sex with an ugly person for drugs, keep using…

10. The first one after rehab or jail is always free. After that, you will be paying thousands. There is no “free heroin”. It goes into the cosmic bank of suffering and misery likes company. 

Please feel free to add you own..., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1p4tb4/some_heroin_humor/

He is wearing my pants. There are some Apple Rings next to the bed. That was my favorite cereal. We used to cuddle in this bed. Some of our books are on the floor. He died of an overdose many years ago. He was hiding his use. he had been drinking and snuck off to the bathroom. He died there. He had recently been released from jail. Using after abstinence, Mixing, using alone, using in an unfamiliar place are all risk factors for overdose. I have also ODed. I had a friend there who did CPR and saved my life. I am clean now. I left this room behind. I left this life behind. As much as humanly possible, I tried to use safely.  Any opiate user could end up being me or end up like him. Please use safely. It has been many years, but I still think about him. Be careful r/opiates someone loves you. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1qv676/reasons_to_be_careful/

TITLE: Two r/opiates members saved lives with naloxone in the past week, POST BODY: Some of you that have donated have literally contributed to two different lives saved with naloxone. Here is one story: 
- " Last week my friend called me in panic, telling me that one of our other buddy's had nodded off with him, but couldn't be woken up. His lips were blue, and he was completely unresponsive. He was terrified and knew I had the package. I rushed to his house and gave him a shot of it, and within about 3-5 minutes (can't remember, my perception of time was skewed as I was in a panic.), his breathing started back up, and he opened his eyes...,I fear we would have lost him if I couldn't have administered it to him."

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-10 08:43:12, BODY: It depends. I used to do urine testing. I had a heat gun. If the sample was plus or minus a certain amount on either side, you could take a dirty or give me fresh piss. Then the sample was sent to the lab. If you are on subs or methadone, it must test positive for metabolites. Many labs also test kreatine (sp) levels. When you take another persons test, you never truly know what is in it anyway. What if they are pregnant etc. it depends on what the lab is testing. Honestly, 90% of advice I have seen related to pee tests on here would not have worked at the clinic i worked at. Some of the strictest tests are the DOT ones and some of the probation tests can be the weakest. They fluctuate widely

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-12 23:06:53, BODY: If we are speaking historically, I had a friend who did 3-4 grams a day. I also heard accounts from my ex that Kurt Cobain was cooking up heroin in a fondue pot backstage at some show, my ex stole some of his heroin (he was always classy). My other friend used to use with Kurt when he was just starting to get famous. He said he saw him do back to back syringes. But the dope we used to get in the 90s on the west coast was 33-50%. The "best" was 60% but when dope in my area was tested around 38%, it was killing people. SF had 186 ODs in that year. That is how are OD prevention programs got started.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-13 10:46:00, BODY: The best case scenario would be to find a dr to prescribe methadone for pain. You take it 2-3 times a day and need less because it gives you better coverage for pain management with less sedation. At a clinic, they dose you once daily so it's heavy dosing with peak effect in the am. If you need it for pain at night, I suggest dosing later in the day. The clinic system sucks hard at first but it's cheap and effective

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-19 00:01:10, BODY: I make no money off my blog. You can sell ads but I do not. I do it for entirely different reasons at this point. I do a free blog through google blogspot. WordPress also has good sites. My blog gets 350 hits on a slow day, 1,600 on a busy day. I do the blog as a creative outlet. I have made some money selling books but I just put that $ into my harm reduction efforts. I promised my husband that I would not take $ away from the family so I had to come up with a way to make side money so i decided to sell the pdfs as i was going along. I have a full time job.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-19 11:17:23, BODY: If you get into IVing, ppl expect pussy with "free" drugs. I'm not saying you are going to do it but free gets less and less the more addicted you are to heroin. Ppl who IV heroin don't have a lot of extras and the majority of real heroin dealers don't use it and are about their cash

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-20 18:41:22, BODY: So I would look around for a different sub doctor. The suboxone.com site are all sponsored drs. I would look for the SAMSHA opiate treatment program locator. Methadone is another option. A short term detox is like $320 for a month. Many ppl who get subs sell half or part of their script to pay for the medication. Kicking at home sucks but it's possible if you have support. There are ppl that quit opiates on their own and it can be very difficult. Good luck

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-24 07:29:54, BODY: We tell people to IM because the process of finding a vein and using it when you are in a crisis is not recommended. Even if you are a junkie, think of the vein issues that many IV user have. We absolutely do NOT recommend sitting and searching for a vein. IM is not a faster route of administration but the process is MUCH faster. I collected research from people after saves and the reaction time from IMing the naloxone was 3-5 mins. I collected hundreds of these after use surveys. Also the needles that came with the kits are 22 and 23 gauge so making IV work with many of those is very difficult.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-24 07:32:26, BODY: the route of administration is not faster. The process of using the naloxone in an emergency generally IS faster. Sure there are some people that have pristine veins etc but you have yo get their clothes up, search, etc. The I needle can be shoved straight through their pants legs or shirt if necessary although it is not ideal

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 08:10:48, BODY: This. Bacteriostatic water is always first on the list. Also in a pristine setting, you would use a new syringe to do or prep your rinse, not contaminate whatever water you are using by drawing it up using the same rig after a shot 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 08:12:48, BODY: There are a few places. med lab supply has boxes of 29 1/2 for 11.95 a piece. You can also use vet supply places. They are sometimes cheaper 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 08:16:15, BODY: You have two CNS depressants on board at the same time. Any time that is going on, it is easy to OD especially because it might take 1-2 hours for the peak effect to set in so you think you are fine but you are actually not. Plus, your judgement is off when you are already under the influence in many cases. I did lots of mixing and survived. Other people I knew did mixing and died. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 10:50:08, BODY: it could be worse. The last hit you took could have killed you, It could have been filed with wound boutillism, flesh eating necritis. you could have woken up in jail. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 11:40:54, BODY: A junkie experiences a thousand deaths before they learn to live. All your happy chemicals are stripped and depleted and it becomes impossible to care about anything with the exception of relief. Every day and any day can because the worst day ever because all your hopes are tied up in a substance and the substance cannot nurture you. In the end, the veil of cognitive dissonance is lifted and the two realities can't live in harmony- death and life in the same body at the same time

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 15:18:02, BODY: I have :student loan debt, a mortgage, car note, some credit card debt. I am fortunate that I only acquired 35k on two degrees and I save 10k of that toward buying a house. That being said, my mortgage is going up $200 a month March 1. I thought I had a lot of debts as a junkie but I have a ton now. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 15:20:32, BODY: Those are either 1/2 or 5/16. The 27 5/8 look like harpoons to most ppl but that is the syringe of choice for most SF junkies. The are super rare in other parts of the country 

COMMENT:

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 15:24:49, BODY: Yes you are missing a tremendous rush and low bioavailability  Such a waste. If you are scared of needles, plug them. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 16:09:48, BODY: The 1/2 or 5/16 is the needle length. It is written on the package. Using a needle over causes more bruising and eventually scarring. Also bacteria gets in there unless you are flushing them with diluted liquid bleach. If you can get them at a pharmacy, you just walk in confidently- "i need a ten pack of 31 5/16.". Sounds like you are in a state that will sell them. The ideal is to use a new one every time and rotate spots. You also should ask if they have a sharps container to safely dispose of old ones. I would also google to see if you have a needle exchange in your area

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-27 17:54:50, BODY: Both. When you drink a beer, it takes awhile to reach peak effect. When you smoke heroin (in the case of OP), it takes awhile to reach the peak effect. The worst case scenario is two CNS reaching peak effect at the same time

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-28 20:45:50, BODY: Cotton fever should have gone away by now. It could have been bad dope. Do you have a fever? That would be one of the telltale signs of an infection.  It is flu season so it could be a lot of things. Because the onset was so sudden after the injection it seems to be related to the dope. You could always go to an urgent care place (not the ER). If you have a serious condition, they will send you on to the ER but if you are ok you save a ton of $. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-01-28 21:04:06, BODY: It sounds like a bacterial infection. Do you have someone with you? Get hydrated and have someone on call. If you start getting a fever or start getting worse, go the Dr. You have to go with your gut. I would probably wait but I am not there with you. You have to think about safety first and know when it is time to get medical assistance

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-01 14:22:07, BODY: Use a TINY bit first. And wait an hour or two see how you feel and go from there. Set a timer so you actually don't use more 30 mins in. Opiates reach their peak effect 1-2 hours later in most cases with the exception of IV and even that can be delayed 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-01 17:08:00, BODY: I used to do both together. The problem is that the meth makes you metabolize the dope faster. If you have a habit, that will put you in WD faster. If you shoot them at the same time, it wastes the heroin. If you don't do them at the same time, you can end up being geeked and uncomfortable. Smoking would cut down on this some 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-01 17:13:29, BODY: Um no. What probably happened was a person saw the dr and had some other issue. Because the person had hep C, they can not have acetaminophen.

Do you have a student health center if you go to college? a needle exchange that has a health clinic. A trip to the ER is going to cost $400 or more plus tou will wait all day. I would try a smaller clinic. if you need to go to the ER, they will send you. if the area is not hot, not a fever, no trouble bending the arm etc it generally isnt an abscess. A rash is generally realted to something else like an allergic reaction. If you fell strongly then go.

Also for $20 you usually can sign up at a clinic. if you go in there and ask about signing up, it will be less suspicious if you are hanging around. Plus, you get methadone and you know the dose is real

People invest their hopes, dreams and finances into this working for a shot of abstinence. In reality, the person might have been just as happy going on a nice vacation with some opiate replacement therapy for 1/20th the cost. The joy of rehab is you are taken out of your environment to get your mind right. Why does it have to be an overpriced one?

You need to get a test of your viral load. They essentially have a cure for all but one strain of Hep C. The meds are extremely expensive but the cost is going to come down significantly over the next five years. It generally takes many years to get sick. Taking care of your liver is important ie cutting out or down drinking and use of acetaminophen. I had two coworkers do the clinical trials for the Hep C drugs and the virus was eliminated in less than three weeks on the new treatment. Unless you are symptomatic, I would not do the interferon. It makes people feel extremely sick and some suicidal. There are new drugs just within reach.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-15 12:08:32, BODY: A reasonably priced hep C treatment is the goal for at least 7 drug companies right now according to sources where I work at the department of health. Now that the research is out there that the condition can be cured in like 92% of the cases, they all are jumping at the chance. The big reason is because they all know insurance plans will be forced to pay for the treatment because it saves so much money over dealing with a person  with a liver condition.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-15 13:44:15, BODY: There isn't any good data. They know the relapse rate for people that complete rehab is like 38% in the first year. They also know that if you stay clean five years or more, the majority of those ppl never return to the DOC. There really isn't a lot of good data because opiate use and abuse is so broad. Anecdotally, the majority of my friends from using who did not contract HIV are not using heroin. There are a few but  not many. A lot of them drink or smoke pot, have jobs etc.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-17 12:58:22, BODY: The federal regs say you can get one take home after 90 days and clean UAS (unless the clinic is closed on the weekends. Then you get two)  Step 13 I believe is two years cleans etc. there is a level that gives you almost a month of take homes but most states won't take the risk. I worked at a clinic for almost five years. The federal rules are archaic. Making ppl come that often is counterproductive 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-17 15:02:03, BODY: If you are using opiates, any methadone clinic in the US will put you on for free that day. They may give you subs instead.

When they got busted, they would just get deported and spend their money then come back with a new package and do it again. They all had places out in Richmond CA and sold dope in the city. I would meet them out there. They were all pretty decent and very well organized. They all supported families at home and had no job prospects in their villages.

I would take no more that 10-20 mg as a starter dose. Methadone is extremely powerful and can knock you on your ass. It is extremely easy to OD on it if you mix with booze or benzos. It stays in your system for a day MINIMUM

So then we were tripping balls by then so everyone that saw how high we were wanted some. So then ppl started coming over my house looking for it since they had never heard of such a thing. So basically seven people put an unknown substance up there arm, six of those based on the fact that it did not kill the first person.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-21 11:49:17, BODY: I would try suboxone or methadone outpaitent or intensive outpatient with a sub detox phase before I drop any $ for rehab. I have been a drug counselor for many years. Rehabs have a very low success rate if the person isnt highly motivated. I would never, ever recommend paying out of pocket for inpatient as a first step unless the person had a myriad of complex medical issues.

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-22 16:10:23, BODY: if you have money, don't whore for dope. I used to turn some tricks in my youth. Sex as a commodity should always be paid in money, not dope. That makes you a toss up which is much lower than a hooker in that world. If he is already making it clear he demands sex, he will never give you what you are worth. Always negotiate from a position of strength. Really, it is a slippery slope and not worth getting into unless you are fully prepared for the consequences

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-26 18:31:55, BODY: I was kicking dope and I took 8 2mg klonopin and three xanax. I was walking through CivIc Center park. I was so fucked up, I stopped at a stairwell and I got raped. He had a knife but he didn't have to forcibly rape me. I was so fucked up I asked him "please don't cut my face." he was high on crack and made me sit with him for like an hour after it was done while he came down. I ran into that guy later. It turned out he was a pimp. I got in his face and he put a 22 to my head in front of all these people. I told him "shoot me, kill me, do me a favor but you can't change what you did to me" This was right up on the block. Some of his hoes pushed me out of the way. This story is 100% true. I never took drugs like that again. I completely lost my edge and payed a price for it. They put a playground over the spot where he raped me. I used to go sit there in my addiction. It was right in fron of city hall

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-02-28 17:27:50, BODY: This is very black and white thinking shoved down our throats by abstinenced based places. Some people simply grow out of drugs. Some people stop using hard drugs and smoke weed and pot. Some people wil continue to have binges. Some people will get clean on opiate replacement programs. Some people will continue to use. Some people will go to jail. Some people will become abstinent. Some people will die from drugs. There is a ton of room from end to end. That type of limited thinking keeps people from progressing.

Totally random but if you are on opiates and get pregnant, any methadone clinic in the country generally can start you the same day at no cost.

TITLE: Rambling about anxiety in recovery, POST BODY: i have been clean 16 years. Around two years ago, I had a series of panic attacks. I started seeing a therapist again and was prescribed ativan as needed. I had 3-4 more attacks and some smaller ones and the attacks stopped after 3-4 months. in December 2013, I had a massive panic attack. It had been so long since the last one, it had took me like 20 mins to figure out what was wrong. I tried the therapy again but Ive had 9 years of therapy. i am burnt out. I started doing accupuncture and meditation. I feel nervous/shitty about having to take ativan although I have taken around 15(total) .5 ativan in two years. I tried to get the Dr to put me on psyche meds but she said my level is not at that point yet. This anxiety freaking sucks though. It reminds me of addiction -that feeling like you have no control over yourself. My sponsor and my support system are all very aware of my situation but i felt like telling someone else., PERMALINK: /r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/21ovi0/rambling_about_anxiety_in_recovery/

TITLE: New Jersey EMTs to carry narcan(minus the spam ad), POST BODY: 
Governor Christie Allows New Jersey EMT’s To Carry Narcan To Prevent Overdoses

Overdose Prevention Act

Heroin overdose has become such a growing problem in New Jersey that the Governor has asked EMTs to complete a training course in order to save lives from drug poisoning. Governor Chris Christie wanted to offer EMTs the option of using the drug Narcan, a medication that can reverse the effects of a heroin overdose, in order to reduce the number of deaths related to this issue. The Christie administration needed to create a waiver allowing EMTs to use the drug and receive training since it was not covered by state EMT rules. The action was prompted by an epidemic of deaths caused by heroin overdoses in the state of New Jersey.

Heroin Overdose Crisis in New Jersey
The Governor of New Jersey was concerned about the level of heroin abuse in his state after drug-related deaths rose from 1,026 in 2011 to 1,294 in 2012. The increase in heroin overdoses is something that Christie hopes to bring down with the help of first-responders equipped with Narcan. The Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Health and Human Services are working with the Ocean County Prosecutor’s office to provide the medication. An emergency overdose situation can be turned around with the ability to use this drug to reverse the effects of excessive heroin consumption. For first responders to be able to carry and administer this type of medication can mean the difference between life and death for people dealing with dangerous heroin addictions.

Protection to Use Life-Saving Medication
The amount of heroin overdose deaths in New Jersey was an issue especially in Ocean County where they more than doubled within only a year. In 2012 there were reportedly 53 drug overdose deaths followed by a record-breaking 112 overdose deaths most of which were caused by opioids or heroin. After this dramatic increase in overdose deaths, Christie signed into law the Overdose Prevention Act which protects those administering the drug Narcan such as healthcare professionals or pharmacists from any civil, criminal or professional liability. After signing the law, the recent waiver was necessary in order to include EMTs to be protected from liability as well. With EMTs protected by law and properly trained in using Narcan it will be possible for them to save more lives as they are responding to overdose situations.

Up until Governor Christie’s recent actions, EMTs in the state of New Jersey were not allowed to carry or administer Narcan according to the Department of Health’s regulations. The department opted to approve a training course for EMTs to complete in order to allow them access to use the drug on overdose victims. The drug Narcan is also called Naloxone in its generic form and is usually administered through a nasal spray. It works to reverse the effects of opoid overdose by blocking opoids from attaching to opoid receptors in the brain. The medication can be effective at preventing overdose but it depends on how much of the drug the person used and how quickly their body can process the drug. Administering the drug however, can dramatically increase the chance that victims can survive an overdose if EMTs respond quickly and effectively.

Since drug overdoses related to heroin use have reached an all-time high in New Jersey, the new law protecting EMTs and allowing them to use life-saving medications was an important decision for the Governor of the state. The goal of the law is to curb the epidemic of overdose deaths and give heroin addicts a second chance at life. The ability of EMTs to use the drug is expected to have a big impact on the growing crisis., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/25dh5h/new_jersey_emts_to_carry_narcanminus_the_spam_ad/

TITLE: Tutorial- how not to get an abscess, POST BODY: - clean injection site with soap and water or wipes before use
- use new cotton every time
- use sterile filters 
- use new syringes 
- use clean surfaces used for prep
- use sterile water 
- do not use things like spit, Gatorade, soda to inject
- do not share equipment 
- stay hydrated 
- do not overuse antibiotics. It will make treatment much more complicated 
- do not trust other people to do a sterile prep. Either do your own or watch each step. 

If you have no access to sterile supplies, at MINIMUM clean your injection sites before and after and get clean water. It makes a huge difference . 

I hear people say on here- well I have shot up a zillion times and never had an abscess. Well, it is like an OD. Just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it won't and if it does it is life threatening.

Educating a friend about overdose
Handing out pamphlets
Posting OD awareness materials on social media
Volunteering at a needle exchange 
Signing a petition for naloxone expansion
Watching a video on OD prevention 

We can also create a thread honoring loved ones. 

I hope people will participate. We had a great response in November for service day. I am tired of people dying- I want to create change. The momentum is with us. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2b1w1h/international_overdose_awareness_day_august_31/

Police are carrying naloxone in many states including parts of Ohio and NY.

Our goal is to not stop until the FDA changes the law so naloxone is no longer a prescription drug and becomes available over the counter. There are too many senseless deaths. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2hasq7/naloxone_updates/

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-11-01 12:01:09, BODY: I have dated numerous addicts. The first one shot me up for the first time. We are still friends but he used me to a certain extent. I had a few boyfriends that hit me when they were high on stimulants. I had a few that loved me but loved drugs more so things never worked out. I had one who beat me the entire relationship and then stalked me about two years after I got clean to the point I had to get a restraining order. I dated a few girls, most I am still friends with. 

I also had some very close male friends that I would get high and cuddle with. I am friends with them, the ones that are clean especially. Not everyone on drugs is a asshole but that was always the type that I gravitated towards- people that were emotional unstable and the drugs made it worse. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-11-01 13:24:18, BODY: I totally forgot about the first guy i dated when I got really strung out. That guy was gold. He was an awesome boyfriend, awesome person. We dated for five months. When we detoxed off dope on methadone, we realized that it was not going to work out. I wasn't done using. We had an awful break up at the end because I started using again. He left and became a male model then quit to become a vet tech.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2014-11-01 16:19:08, BODY: He left SF dabbled a bit with heroín in NY, did the modeling then went home for a visit and never left.

We were friends on social media and talked on the phone once or twice until he deleted his fb last year.

If you already missed a few days, you could taper with subs now.

I also had a segment of my caseload that were hardcore users than were very very honest about whatever they used. other people gamed the system too. We used heat guns so a lot of the artificial pee and microwave options were out for diversion. We also tested for methadone and methadone metabolite.

Florida passed a needle exchange bill in one half of the state congress but it never made it to the second half. There was a law passed around plan B and emergency contraception allowing pharmacists to opt out of dispensing this medicine. Well, now pharmacists have used that to dispense syringes in various states at their own discretion even if it isn't illegal

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-02 12:32:21, BODY: I finished graduate school in 2007. I have about $34k in loans but I used part of my student loans to buy a house so I am not complaining. Plus, my salary doubled when i got a job with my masters degree

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-02 12:55:08, BODY: If you to school, you have to start early to find people that can help you get a job in your field. Lots of unpaid internships don't equal jobs. You have to find ways to get on people's radar screen. 90% of getting any job is who you know. I have 23 staff and have hired tons of people. People rarely hire someone they have never heard of or someone who has no connection to anyone they know. Keep your fuck ups to a select few. Also, people love a rebound story. You would be surprised how many people have had/had drug problems and are sympathetic. I had an interview where this lady cried from stress in the interview. I hired her and she was one of the best employees ever. She is a therapist now. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-02 13:55:24, BODY: As crazy as that is I find "Last exit to Brooklyn" to be way more gritty. Requiem for a dream has a lot of things I have seen at least a dozen times although I have one one friend that lost an arm- a few legs but only one arm

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-02 15:43:20, BODY: Sub doctors have the luxury of having more patients needing subs verses doctors able to prescribe so they keep the lowest risk patients. My work has a free bupe clinic so i get to hear all the inside dirt from the clinicians there. Suboxone is a cash cow for drs and the drug company Reckitt

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-02 16:58:02, BODY: Requiem for a dream definitely is a better movie. Agreed. I think "Last Exit to Brooklyn" would have been a bitch to adapt because there is so much color there, like a world inside a world. Plus how can you explain a transexual going to suck a dick that tastes like shit from another transexual and how that hurt their feelings to a mainstream audience 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-02 17:00:27, BODY: I think it is fucked as well. From what I understand, their perspective is why keep giving you a drug where their is evidence it isn't working. To them, if you piss dirty a few times, the drug doesn't work so why keep prescribing for it. Not saying they are right, just putting it out there

He got diabetes from the booze, ended up with partial amputations in his foot. He had multiple strokes (still booze and diet related). He ended up in a nursing home partially paralyzed for three years before he died. He drank most of my life, drank until he got nose bleeds. Sometimes he pissed himself. Went to multiple rehabs. No one can tell me alcohol isn't a fucking drug. No one can tell me the treatment system we have today works for everyone. I have plenty of evidence it does not.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-08 19:57:08, BODY: They didnt spend millions on the drug. The generic naloxone has been out for years. The only thing they invented was the design of the device itself which copies an epipen. The FDA fast tracked this. It was only proposed less than a year ago. They didnt even have the final concept down. There was no new drug to approve 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-08 20:19:08, BODY: true. From what I understand, they aren't marketing to the needle exchange crowd.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-01-19 14:38:24, BODY: Getting robbed is not when someone walks off your money. That is getting beat. I have been robbed three times. When I was selling heroin on the corner, I had someone put a knife to my throat once. I knew they were desperate so I gave them a few bags not everything I had. I knew they would be satisfied with that. The second time, I had people who were supposed to be my friends choke me to rob me. Again, I only gave them some, not everything. 

The last time, my boyfriend and I were in our hotel room. We did not have all of our shit out. Someone knocked at the door. He let them in because he knew them. We were staying in the wrong hotel. The drug people in this hotel were not people we normally associated with because they were more into crack. Dude pulled out a gun. He had a few people with him. they were about to turn my boyfriend upside down when he told them I had money and speed in my bra. I think we had $80. They took that and some speed and left. He had a few hundred in his sock they never found. 

The point of these true stories is really never keep all your shit in one place. I was brave/stupid at the time. I could look a person in the face and lie to them. Mostly because I was desperate. This was not particularly smart. I don't advise it. I got robbed because I sold drugs. That shit is dangerous. You think people are your friends. They really are not. Once you get past the social phase of using, things get serious. I personally have seen people stabbed, beaten, stomped, an AK pulled on someone, other guns, people held hostage over missing drugs and money, people forced to prostitute over drug debts.

There was a little core group of us that used to use together. We had jobs, apartments, etc then eventually we lost all of it. Amazingly, almost all of us from my little circle are clean now- the ones that didn't die. Clean meaning not on heroin or other "hard" drugs. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2zpczp/question_of_the_day_does_anyone_in_your_everyday/

In other states, there are naloxone programs so laws have been passed protecting people who have it. Then there are other states. It is a prescription med, not a controlled substance. I only get the IM injection kind. Naloxone can be up to $40 a dose. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-04-09 20:32:04, BODY: I am part of a program. I collect donations for related expenses for which I have many (stamps, envelopes, my travel expenses). My overall costs is around $120 a month. I had a steady flow of donations for awhile but it has slowed to a trickle. I also some times buy boxes of syringes for people or extra supplies. I know Nick from the new York needle exchange must have a hookup for at least getting the steri filts in bulk. You need an index code as being a program. That alone would save a fuck ton of money. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-04-09 21:27:40, BODY: No public funding. I get help from friends. I have one regular donor who provides $50 a month. I get larger donations here and there.

Fever is important. Also redness and swelling at the site. This can indicate cellulitis or something worse

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2015-04-24 12:50:21, BODY: The person involved didn't post the link. She was in a coma at the time. Her family created the campaign to cover expenses that were not covered by her insurance. She was unable to get medi-cal- she had insurance. She was released from acute care because her insurance is now refusing to pay. I believe she probably hit the lifetime maximum for her plan. When that insurance drops her, she may get public insurance after a waiting period. 

. I am not saying I am in favor or not in favor of posting the links. What I am saying is that the post is inaccurate.

One of the sections of the book highlights issues around the current state of harm reduction and treatment in the US. I have been a naloxone advocate for over a decade so that will surely be a section. Lack of clean needles are another. The methadone clinic system is a possibility.

I think psychedelic treatment needs more study. I, personally, have known multiple people to do the ibogaine. none stayed off opiates. However, this trip was must less costly than a trip to rehab and had some positive results overall.

TITLE: A few things, POST BODY: 1. I don't send suboxone. Suboxone is a controlled substance used to combat addiction. I send naloxone, not to be confused with naltrexone. Naloxone is used to combat an overdose.

2. I don't have a supplier for syringes any more. I do occasionally send syringes but not to the degree I was when I had 300-400 at a time. If you have some you would like donate, let me know. 

3. If you have revived someone or were revived with naloxone, please report it. 

4. if you have received a care package, please acknowledge that you have received it. 

5. I generally do not send things to places where exchanges sites are readily available.

6. Finally, just as small reminder, I am married with three kids and a full time job. I do the best I can. Love you all :), PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3f8lq3/a_few_things/

TITLE: Maine Woman's Obit highlights Maine's terrible Drug Policies and their impact, POST BODY: BANGOR – Coleen Sheran Singer (born Coleen Sheran Clark) would have turned 33 this August 31, but she died in Lewiston in an unsuspecting suburban professional couple’s home of a heroin overdose on the morning of December 25, 2014.

She was a victim of herself, of LePage’s politics, of our society’s continuing ignorance and indifference to mental illness, and of our society’s asinine approach to drug addiction. Born in Biddeford and raised near OOB, Coleen lived the last three years of her life mostly as a transient in the Bangor area with increasing problems with infections in her limbs, a lack of MaineCare to pay for antibiotics outside the hospital, and escalating problems with the law following misdemeanor illegal drug possession convictions, failures to appear and a 2009 conviction for solicitation of prostitution. Coleen’s father left when she was younger than two. Coleen’s mother doted on Coleen when she was a child and made a good home for her, but barely eked out a living working long hours cleaning houses and motel rooms. Coleen’s mother was abused as a child in foster care out-of-state, had zero family support in Maine, and struggled at times with drug issues of her own. Though Coleen dropped out of high school, she was intellectually gifted and artistically talented, quick to grasp complicated legal and philosophical concepts. She had near perfect facial recognition and could glance at a person and know his or her clothing sizes to a T. While Coleen was capable of great compassion and would give the shirt off her back to one less fortunate, she was also at times a con artist, thief, and liar. Though Coleen presented herself with great panache among friends, she could be painfully shy and insecure in what many would consider “normal society.” Apart from her drug addictions – or more likely much of the reason for them – Coleen suffered from serious borderline personality disorder. Unless you knew her well over a good length of time, you would not know. Beset by affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood, an unstable sense of self, impulsivity, and a pattern of intense but unstable interpersonal relations, Coleen flashed amazing smiles, but lived an inner life where she often felt intense emptiness, loneliness, and depression. By the time she was 18, Coleen was injecting opiates, crack, and various forms of amphetamines, while also abusing alcohol and other drugs. Coleen met her one and only husband and the only consistent male figure in her life (other than an older half-brother) when she was 22 and she had just started what turned out to be her longest, most successful time in recovery. The marriage was very brief, a couple years into Coleen’s recovery, but they remained dear friends until the day she died. For nearly four years Coleen was in methadone clinics and dedicated herself to sobriety. Taking to heart the adage that “without drugs, anything is possible,” and with the sometimes slavish devotion of the man she briefly married, Coleen earned her driver’s license, went to the gym regularly, completed nail tech school, worked successfully both part time in retail sales and full time caring for disabled adults, and enrolled in community college. But in the end Coleen’s untreated personality disorder and addictions prevailed. In later years, after LePage removed poor adults from MaineCare, Coleen could not afford the methadone clinic. Heroin was the cheapest way to avoid going into withdrawal. For readers without loved ones who are opiate addicts, you cannot imagine how powerful and difficult is that disease. The author of this obituary, who grew up comfortably removed from such things, thought he was educated but had no idea. Addicts shoot up to avoid being deathly ill and because the disease heightens also the psychological desire for the drug and the needle. Real addicts rarely manage to get high they just scratch and claw everyday to avoid dope sickness. Coleen wanted to get back into a methadone clinic, but LePage and enough republicans in the Legislature said “No” to the Medicaid expansion. It is no stretch to say that but for LePage’s veto of the Medicaid expansion, Coleen probably would not have shot the heroin that ended her life, and probably would not have had the serious recurring infections that ravaged her limbs the last couple years. That is not to say Coleen would be living happily ever after, since there were other significant problems. While in recovery, Coleen travelled extensively and did many wonderful things. She was particularly fond of an avant-garde theater in Washington, D.C. called the Woolly Mammoth. Coleen loved to pick flowers, shop for jeans, dance, work with crafts, and drink medium ice coffees with eight creams and eight equals (formerly eight creams, eight skim, and eight equals, until she started drinking “more coffee”). Coleen is survived by her dedicated mother, her very saddened older half-brother, a few women with whom at various times she maintained special relationships, numerous boyfriends who seemed to come and go, one boyfriend in particular named Les who among them was more special to her than the others, a few other older men along the way who genuinely tried to care for her, 100’s of acquaintances in this area, her adorable Chihuahua named Squeak, and the author of this obituary whose life was made more difficult, but also much better for having known her.

Coleen, rest in peace.

A Cast of Chemical Characters
There are different kinds of people in this world. Just as there is diversity in the world around us, so it logically follows there would be diversity in the addict habitat. Here are a few:

Captain save a bro:
This type of user refuses to admit he is addicted, yet constantly wants to sample some of your bag. He will arrive on the scene with money swearing up and down that he is not going to use. He has a job, a place to live and will occasionally let you stay there. Yet, the captain can only use at your place therefore you are happy to see him as he always has money.

Chronic illness Jill:
Jill does not have cancer, lupus, or any other diagnosable condition. No, Jill is ALWAYS sick yet will not have sex with you or anyone for drugs. Her general good looks enticing yet she only wants to cuddle after she has ingested copious amounts of YOUR drugs. If she ever has her own drugs, she certainly is not sharing with you. Between her over priced connect and constant whining, you would put her out if she was not so damn cute.

Scandalous Steve: You can not trust this motherfucker with a god damn thing yet he always has access to THE BEST drugs. Plus, he save you that one time from that overdose. Steve is a ride or die kind of junkie when he is holding but those fingers get sticky as he gets sicker.

Scripted Shelia- She is that older chic with the pain pills. She will give you a ride if you kick her down when her monthly runs out. And it always does.

Stepper Sam- Sam went to twelve step meetings once a few relapses back and likes to talk about recovery while you are high. He can quote all the literature and like to say things like "easy does it" while you are fixing your drugs.

Always Overdose Oscar- Get your narcan ready- Oscar is coming over. He likes to do WAAAY too much. When he wakes up under a table, he denies that he ever fell out. You have strongly considered taking the locks of the bathroom just in case.

Prison Paul- Prison Paul likes to get high and tell stories about the joint. He is an expert in both dropping a bottle for your PO and creating delicious entrees from ramen and cheetos. He never carries his own syringes for legal reasons.

Finally, there is your get high and hope to die dope fiend. Everyone enjoys talking shit about this person yet wants some of their drugs. Some work, some do not yet using is their full time job. They can explain how to extract the opiate as well as extracting the last dollar out of your pocket. They think in grams, stamps, books, bindles, and bundles. They are part doctor, nurse, chemist, criminal, counselor, and attorney.

I am just playing around here but if you find yourself...., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3kuswh/cast_of_chemical_characters/

TITLE: Online Survey of injectors, POST BODY: 
Hi, My name is Nick and I work at a needle exchange in NYC (http://cornerproject.org/). I've developed a survey for people who inject drugs as a way of building a case for expanding syringe access to include providing safer injecting supplies via mail, free of charge. As you all probably know, Tracey has been doing a fine job sending people supplies but her reach is very limited due to the lack of funding for such a thing. I'm trying my best to change that. I'm originally from Australia where injecting supplies are free and very accessible. It blows my mind reading people's stories about having to buy syringes, or having to travel hours to a needle exchange (if your state even has one). Ideally, i'd like to set up an online needle exchange where people can place orders discreetly and receive what they need free of charge. We're a long way from that happening but we've gotta start somewhere. The survey only takes a few minutes to fill out and asks questions about how you get your injecting supplies, what drugs you use, if you re-use needles etc. It would be great if the injectors on this sub (USA only) could take the time to fill it out. Please hit me up if you have any questions. Thanks, Nick. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YTmk5y8j5qGSTz5zdf4Zaf4sUoOZoB9LiBTbKeiFHjc/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1

TITLE: A dope fiend prayer, POST BODY: I lost a friend this week to an OD. He wasn't a IRL friend but a friend never the less. We had been online friends for 11 years. He had kicked methadone bu using Cannabis and had been off many years. I don't know why he tried using again. Well, I don 't know the specific reasons. I know why we do it. We think "just one more" or life becomes to painful or we are depressed. We might even be celebrating. Who the fuck knows. 

I quit heroin 17 years ago. I did that. In that 17 years, I have been prescribed opiates 5 times. The longest was for 2 weeks after an emergency c-section. I remember enjoying that feeling, the familiar cloud. I had to taper off with a newborn. My legs were twitching while she screaming in my ears. The agony and the not quite joy but certainly the lack of pain. That was 8 years ago. My body fell into that place again, the vulnerable place. It was but I rolled with it. Every time you kick, it is always hard. Even if it is a medical necessity. 

What was my friend thinking? Maybe he wasn't thinking at all. Maybe picking up was a natural as tying his shoes. I can never ask him

I wrote this today. Maybe you can relate.

TITLE: Care Packages Update, POST BODY: I have been seriously behind in getting out packages and I am going to Atlanta this weekend. I hope to get back on track next week. I have about 200 29 1/2 gauge syringes ready to send out. If you are over 18, in the US, and live in an area with no harm reduction services, I send out syringes and other harm reduction supplies if I have them. I don't ship to California, New York, or Mass unless there is a extremely compelling reason as syringes and naloxone can both be purchased in pharmacies there. Message me privately if you are patient and can wait for said supplies. 

Also, if you live with your parents or room mates, I have NO control over when they arrive. In addition, you have to provide a name for delivery. if you do not, it makes it even more likely whomever you don't wan't to open the package will, in fact, open it. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3lzt4f/care_packages_update/

TITLE: An Anesthelogist/former user posted this on my blog. I thought it was insightful., POST BODY: "Hi Tracey ,
I am an Anaesthesiologist in another country who has almost unlimited access to high purity opioids and fell into the pit of addiction to Meperidene then Alfentanil . That was seventeen years ago and apart from one month relapse eleven years ago, have been clean of that slavery. I reported myself to my Professional Body and for a year sent weekly urine for opiate testing to prove to the slanderers that was clean (my own idea) . I gave a lecture on chemical dependency to my clolleagues and have built a new life to put defences in place against relapse (I dont get cravings despite daily availability). I just do not want to become a slave to this substance ever again. After turning my car over and nearly overdosing, I learnt the lesson that any drug does not give you pleasure without demanding back that pleasure in opposite terms. You pay in so many ways for what you do not to mention your family and self respect being the biggest casualties lasting years. I work as a Doctor with different and more humble insights in what we use to relieve pain. I have watched at least four colleagues overdose and die from opiate abuse - it is a real and ongoing problem shrouded in secrecy and denial.The best defence is to as you have come out in the open and be totally truthful about the mistake and its often fatal consequences.The path to health must involve stronger alternatives to opiates that will make the latter choice to be far less attractive ...like strong friendships/family bonds , regular exercise further education and so forth. 
In your documentary what I noticed that there was little evidence of antiseptic skin preparation. That must lead to skin abscesses, loss of veins not to mention systemic problems like lung and heart valve infections.Even after my ruthless self exposure and abstinence, there are colleagues who will tell me that I have a 10 percent chance of recovery as recently as this year. As a former feedback person said, there are some people who will always be prejudiced and cruel. My two children both have stable good jobs with decent education and my wife has always been supportive. Looking around , Drug addiction is just one form of a spectrum of addictions. Some are addicted to sex, sport, money and even violence. That does'nt make Drug addiction any better as a choice as most of your contributors have said. Society will accept cigarette (Nicotine) addiction but in reality, hard core users go through withdrawal on abstinence apart from the damage they do to their health. Yet many will rant against harder substance abusers as if they are any better on the self destruction scale.", PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3qi5z2/an_anesthelogistformer_user_posted_this_on_my/

TITLE: 140 Saves!, POST BODY: I am excited to report the reddit naloxone program I run had 140 save. This is both exciting and scary as 40 of those were in a fairly short period. in 2015, the reddit naloxone program had received around $2,000 in donations, $1,500 from redditors, $500 from goods/services I provided in exchange for donations. The point being people DO actually care for the health and wellbeing of people on this sub, despite what you may see/think/feel when you step outside of r/opiates. The donations have almost completely covered the costs. Seriously though, the program has been running for 2 years and YOU all are making it happen. Give us junkies more credit, we can make positive things happen.

FYI- if you received naloxone from me, please report this. I keep records for statistical use (no names attached). This helps track OD trends when it goes into the national database., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3qx2vb/140_saves/

Get a vein map and move around spots. Also, use sterile water and clean the injection site as much as humanly possible. Many times bacteria gets injected from the surface of your skin and the water you are using. Be safe!

I am trying to fill back orders now. I can't guarantee anything. I have asked /u/nickwhcp to fill in during my hiatus. He has graciously agreed. He can fill all your (reasonable) care package needs for basics like syringes and naloxone. I do around 10 or less a week so I assume he can do the same. Thank you so much NICK!!!

TITLE: We survived another year., POST BODY: We did it r/opiates. We made it through another year. Let's make a pledge to be safe in 2016. Our little program here has saved our 150 life. We tried to get clean needles out there. We got Andrew, our own person Hep C educator to answer our questions. We got CVS to sell naloxone in states across the nation. 

Our work isn't done though. HIV cases are actually RISING in some Indiana and Florida counties. Users are still contracting Hep C. Pharmacies continue to refuse to sell syringes. Overdose deaths are on the rise. 

Make a commitment to do your part for harm reduction in 2016. Educate a friend. Answer questions. Carry naloxone. Sign petitions, volunteer. Give a fuck about yourself and those around you. 

I had a great vacation and I will be back at packages soon. XOXO Tracey, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3yzbwa/we_survived_another_year/

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-01-08 14:41:48, BODY: Cold copping in that area is easy. They are also having a bunch of fentanyl  ods there. I would believe they brought the dope up if a bunch of ppl fell out in Alabama which isn't the case 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-01-08 15:48:34, BODY: I think they got on the Internet and had ideas where to go. Cincy has open air areas within 5 minutes of the hospital. They did their normal and it had fatal consequences

TITLE: Tax season/harm reduction reminders, POST BODY: Hey! Before you get that extra cash two things:
- get a plan so you don't overdose and die. Do you have naloxone? Are you mixing? getting dope after a period of abstinence? Are you using a new batch? Are you using alone? Create a plan to reduce your risk. The goal is to feel good, right? Be safe, think ahead to make sure you are around for people that love you. 

- consider a small donation to the care package fund. I try to only ask once, maybe twice a year for donations. I have a new person on the harm reduction team- Nick. His packages have already prevented two OD deaths. You can contact us at redditcarepackages@gmail.com . We have limited funds but fill 10 or so requests per week. As always, we attempt to link people to LOCAL sources of harm reduction when possible.

TITLE: 160 saves, POST BODY: When I started sending naloxone to members of r/opiates 2+ years ago, I thought it would be something I would only do for a few months. I am a busy person, I told myself. I have three kids, I told myself. Where would I possibly have the time to do this? Well one person than another than another would send me messages like the one I got this morning:
"Well, I just picked up from being sick all day so I was very ready to get in a shot. And I didn't usually do this dope so I should've done a test shot. And I did a bit more than I normally do and it was a lot stronger than I thought. I remember the rush and then woke up 20 minutes later with my buddy freaking out saying how lucky I was to have that naloxone with me or I would've died. I had stopped breathing. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you do for the people on this site and for all the lives you save on a daily basis"

So weeks went by. Then a few months. Now I am counting the years. I have collected over $3000 in donations from sub members, lurkers, and fund raisers over the years. That money has sent out over 1,000 care packages. I added a partner this year /u/nickwhcp. Various people started sending out packages as well. One person started a program in the Dallas area. We have accomplished some great things. 

When people say users don't care, remember all the things we have accomplished. I will always be a day late to the post office. I will always be short supplies, money, or energy. That is how harm reduction rolls. No one wants to fund us. That being said, we still have saved 160 lives. These are YOUR friends. These are YOUR family. This is us. This is something we all did together.

TITLE: Chasing Heroin Tonight on PBS, POST BODY: I knew this topic would interest you all so I shot some questions to one of the producers Marcela Gaviria.
1. How does this program differ from other shows on the topic? 
There is some terrific reporting on the epidemic.  I think in two hours we cover not just the origins of the epidemic, we report on why the epidemic has not been abated and we examine what needs to be changed in order to contain the worst drug epidemic in our history.  It's all told through intimate and deeply revelatory stories of three addicts, a suburban mom, a 21 year old female from a middle class background, a musician who is now homeless. 
2. With so many different opinions on what is needed, was there anything that stood out as solutions or themes? 
The Obama administration is reviewing the restrictions on prescribing for medication assisted treatment, and from the experts we spoke with, it seems relaxing those rules could be a good start. We could also require insurance plans to include coverage for more than 30 days of inpatient treatment. That’s clearly not enough time to get someone clean.  
3. How did you recruit users? 
I spent a lot of time interviewing possible participants, listening to their life stories.  Sometimes I met them at drug court.  Others I met through the LEAD program in Seattle.   I was introduced to many people in the course of making this film.  I settled for participants that really touched me with their candidness, intelligence and ultimately their struggle.
4. How did you recruit family members? 
That was a lot tougher.  Once I had settled on my participants, I wanted to talk to their extended family about how addiction had impacted their lives, but many didn't want to participate.  The stigma of addiction is still so great.  I was very pleased that I managed to include Kristina's father in this film.  The portrait of a father struggling through his daughter's addiction was very powerful to witness.

5. What do you feel are the take away messages from the program? 
I think the big takeaway is that this epidemic is not unlike the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. Back then, we rallied to come up with solutions. We aren’t doing enough now.  Access to treatment is inadequate. Services stink. Relapse rates are way too high. There aren’t enough studies to tell us what works and what doesn’t work. Over half a million people have died from opiate overdoses in the last 15 years. We clearly can do better.   


I also want to humanize addiction.  It's time we talk about this differently.  To quote the former Deputy Drug Czar, Tom McLellan, "We're
 gonna continue to pay the price for thinking of this as a lifestyle issue, a personality disorder. We're gonna pay that price for a very long time because it's standing in our way of medical progress, of public health progress."

TITLE: Looking for input for National Institute for Drug Abuse, POST BODY: Hi r/opiates. I had a conference call with NIDA this afternoon about my recommendations for the opioid "epidemic". One of my highest priorities is getting feedback from users and pain patients to NIDA. What are some things you would like to see or feel they should know. This thread is going to be shared directly with NIDA so fire away. These are topics that were discussed this morning.
Topics included:
- more research on cannabis as an alternative to opioids. They say they have money available currently for structured trials
- research on cannabis for withdrawal
- expansion of naloxone
- engaging current users in conversation (reddit Q&amp; A coming soon)
- research on the efficacy of loperamide for withdrawal. 
- patient education on opioids 
- efforts to make naloxone over the counter
- strategic placement of naloxone (similar to AEDs) in public places
- what research is being done on pain and when opioids are necessary. 
- opportunities for former users to speak directly to doctors.

TITLE: Cellulitis, POST BODY: Well I feel like a dummy. I am preaching being healthy and I ended up getting cellulitis in my own leg. I scratched the living hell out of my leg one night and it rapidly got infected. I was at urgent care on Sunday where I got some antibiotics. The point being I ignored the basic signs of infection because I thought I "didn't have the time" to be seen. Please take care of yourself. I easily could have gone septic if I would have waited a few extra days as some of y'all do. One of the symptoms I ignored was that tight feeling of the limb. Anyway, I am on the mend and hope to get caught up with care packages soon: , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4bruy9/cellulitis/

Participants would receive harm reduction supplies that are standardized for three months, filing out a survey at the end about risk reduction. I am NOT signing people up. I am simply gauging interest before I beg for funds/funding. The goal is to prove/disprove that online needle and naloxone programs work. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4ffa8f/would_you/

I think he never got over the fact he wasn't "man enough" to provide during the younger years. The family moved constantly before I was 2. Different states, etc. I suspect my parents got married because my mom was pregnant but they never really answered. My father joined the navy to get out of poverty. He had no running water until he was 17. It made him a very hard person. When we ended up getting some $ coming in, he was the same person with his tube socks pulled up to his knees, his slippers, white t-shirts and snotty hankerchiefs hanging out of his back pocket. What happened to the Juicy Juice? it was so damn sweeeeeet

The issue is people ESPECIALLY young people thinking "it will never happen to me" (just like it happened to me) or other getting you hooked before you get educated on the consequences. Don't stick anything in your body without knowing what it is and what it can do to you. Food, medicine, etc

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2016-06-26 16:34:03, BODY: Well the real solution is a national program of supporting harm reduction. On an individual level, cleaning your skin and using STERILE water can go a long way if you do not have new syringes. Tap water is not sterile. bottled water is not sterile but is superior if you have no other options. We have bacteria that live on our skin. Cleaning the injection site keeps a person from pushing them in.

She was explaining that according to tests, anyone on the east coast should assume their dope is cut with fentanyl. She was also explaining that one of things they are going to start recommending that one of the key elements of survival with fentanyl is injecting as slowly as possible. She explained that tar, by nature, is going to take longer to push through the syringe. The ECP folk are at even higher risk because how quickly they are injecting, flooding the receptors. The new harm reduction recommendations are going to suggest injecting as slowly as humanly possible to survive. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4qpa12/psa_fentanyl_laced_dope/

TITLE: Posted on behalf of Project Weber, POST BODY: Updated the post with some drug safety tips!
Hello Redditors!
Currently, I am working at Project Weber, an incredible organization which is devoted to harm reduction, and improving the lives of those who need a helping hand. Below I posted a short history of what Project Weber/Renew are all about. Essentially, we are a non-profit harm reduction agency for male, female, and trans sex workers.
History Project Weber was founded in 2008 as a harm-reduction organization for street-based male sex workers (MSW) in Rhode Island. The organization provides many services, confidentially and free of charge, including: rapid HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing, condoms and safer sex materials, syringe exchange and injection kit disposal, overdose reversal medications (Narcan/Naloxone), in-house and street-based peer-led support and outreach, risk-reduction counseling, and supported referrals. PW services are delivered primarily by peer workers – former sex workers who are keenly aware of the distinct psychosocial needs of MSW. Through this peer-driven model, PW has established trusting relationships with a large group of MSW in the greater Providence area. These experiences give the organization unique access to the target population and facilitate their utilization of the services provided.
Project RENEW was founded in 2006 with the goal to work collaboratively to provide services for women engaged in, or at risk for, commercial sex work or human trafficking in Rhode Island, with a focus on Providence, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. The primary focus of the organization is peer-led street outreach, intensive case management, HIV and HCV prevention and testing, basic needs services, and referrals. The clients are referred to partner agencies that provide services as diverse as detox, substance abuse treatment, mental and physical healthcare, housing, legal aid, and job training and employment. Project RENEW also works to advocate for increased resources for at-risk women, and serves as an information “portal” for those researching commercial sex work.
In 2016, Project Weber and Project RENEW merged in order to combine their efforts to serve a range of high-risk men and women, including transgender persons. Prior to merging, the two programs mirrored each other in many of their respective programs including HIV prevention and testing services as well as basic needs and referrals delivered through a peer street outreach model. This merger will position the new organization as one of the few agencies in the nation dedicated to serving a diverse population of sex workers. It is our hope that the merging of these two projects at the forefront of harm reduction work will facilitate information sharing among staff and peer workers to promote best practices across sex worker populations. We further anticipate that this merger will enable the new organization to secure additional funding focused on this broader, more inclusive population, including the transgender population, which had previously been underserved in Rhode Island.
Drug Safety Drug safety is an incredibly important issue to Weber/Renew. Often times, users may not know all the precautionary steps that they can take in order to better their experience, and reduce risk. Firstly, IV usage must be addressed. Using clean needles, and using NEW needles is imperative in reducing harm. While needles may look sharp after a few uses, they actually can become blunt after as little as one use, depending on the gauge of the needle. As the needle becomes more blunt, the odds of it tearing through tissue, and leaving pathways for pathogens to enter your body increase, which puts the user at great risk. Although cleanliness of needles is often touched upon, reusing needles is an issue which definitely deserves some more coverage. An excellent resource for IV usage can be found here.
Another piece of information that is commonly overlooked is the fact that crack pipes, which are often not the best quality glass, can transmit diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This doesn’t occur simply because of the transfer of saliva, but instead it occurs because as the glass pipe is heated, it can cause sores and lesions in the user’s mouth, which can then be a pathway for transmitting disease. An extremely simple solution to this is to use an adaptor which doesn’t get extremely warm on the stem of the pipe. This can be something as simple as some vinyl tubing, or it can be a dedicated mouthpiece that you have purchased.
As far as other, more well-known pieces of advice go, it is essential that if you are an opiate user, you also have some Narcan/Nalaxone on hand. This stuff can truly work wonders, and now it is being offered over the counter in many states, it may be expensive in some states, but your life is worth more! Another thing that is touched upon to frequently is the testing of heroin. Other drugs have the luxury of receiving publicity about the various reagents that are used to identify them, however, heroin is often overlooked in this regard. A testing reagent can be found here. The reagent is used to detect acetyl-fentanyl in your heroin. Again, it does cost money but your life is worth more.
If you would like to learn more check us out at: http://projectweber.org/ If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask us anything and I’ll do my best to respond! PM’s are also welcome if you would feel more comfortable not posting publically. Stay safe everyone!, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4txzck/posted_on_behalf_of_project_weber/

TITLE: RIP John, POST BODY: John was a member here a few years back that deleted his old account. He had been struggling recently. His mom messaged me this morning to tell me he had passed yesterday. John really struggled with the boredom that came with a life without heroin. Our last message was about finding things to do. He also tried Kratom which I'm not sure helped or hurt him in the end. It may have just kept him from getting on a replacement program which may have been what he really needed. I'm rambling now. Rest easy , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5hxwbw/rip_john/

TITLE: Care packages, POST BODY: I have been sending out care packages here in this sub for over three years. The program has 208 recorded naloxone saves plus a wide variety of prevention supplies that have been distributed. I ask for supporrting funds a few time a year. If you so feel like making a donation to help your fellow redditor, my paypal is traceyh415@gmail.com. My bitcoin addy is  1KHMdJmCd2t8DN6VVNSaRwGWq4ojVA8imB. The money pays for supplies, stamps, etc. The money gets passed on to Nick as well. He answers the redditcarepackages@gmail.com email. I take requests directly to my inbox here. Whether I receive donations or not, the program is really a labor of love I said I would quit two years ago but can't seem to give up. 

If you feel more confident in providing to harm reduction agencies where you get donation letters, I personally recommend:
The Cincinnati Exchange Project,
Rebel recovery (florida),
Prevention Point (PA),
The North Carolina Harm Reduction Coallition,
The Missouri Recovery Network (St Louis),
The Dope Project (SF)

TITLE: Question of the Day- What do you think are the most important issues facing users today?, POST BODY: When I was deep in the life, we feared AIDS more than an OD. We knew there was no medications at that time. Everyone around you was dying from it, had it, or it was suspected they had it. An OD was considered "quick" (although this is a myth. You don't always die. You can wake up with serious injury, brain damage, etc). If you contracted the virus back then, you were told you had two years to live. (Also not always true. Many people lived to see the medications hit the market). They suspected I had hIV twice, especially after a nasty case of thrush. I've outlived a large chunk of my peers. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/68n43u/question_of_the_day_what_do_you_think_are_the/

You end up with two maybe three quotes. I spoke with them to provide my perspective on our sub because I knew/know the story is going to run with or without our voice so I tried to inject information on the need for harm reduction and social support this sub plays.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-08-12 12:22:15, BODY: I've only really smoked when i was drunk. My parents used to smoke two packs of pall mall gold 100s a piece daily so it really turned me off to smoking early in life. When they died, so much of the things had a musty cigarette smell I think all of us siblings had this same reaction of not wanting the memories attached.

2. If someone gave you 100 syringes, what percentage do you think you would use and how many would make it to friends etc

3. How many times on average would you say you re-use a syringe? 

4. Do you use alone or with someome?


This is just informal. I’m looking into what is actually working out there.  I may do a formal survey at some point. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/77vtju/a_few_harm_reduction_questions/

Also: this in no way negates the abuses men might have received or anyone anywhere in the gender spectrum. Women are just the focus of this investigation. 

Also part 2: I am not involved. This happened to me in rehab so I am just trying to get these stories out there so some reform can occur in the rehab industry.

TITLE: Mixing Benzos with opioids PSA, POST BODY: I see lots of commentary here around mixing various Benzos and another CNS depressant like alcohol with opioids. I want to remind folks that if you drink or take some Benzos, then do your opioids, an overdose may not be instant. All these can compound on each other depending on metabolism and route of administration to cause an overdose later in the game. It’s pretty common among us to take a drink or maybe take a Xanax to take the edge of when sick THEN get our goods and be complacent or even get in a Benzo fog and not realize how much we are taking. Everyone is getting the dangers of fentanyl in the drug supply but we seem to forget that mixing is the number two cause of OD death.

Getting killed in the train yard 
Or will I be an old ho
Getting thrown from a trick’s car
Or will I be a dope chic 
Pussy full of crack rocks 
Or should I steal from retail stores 
Goin to prison when I get caught. 
I dedicated my life to the drink. 
Relapsing and Antabuse. 
I dedicated my life to meth
Shadow people and a short fuse. 
I’m dedicated to shady men
No place to sleep and a black eye. 
I’m dedicated to a life of pain. 
Throw in the Cotton.

TITLE: A few things, POST BODY: Hi friends- 
Just to cover a few issues. A while back, a few people who frequented this sub died of overdoses. After their deaths, the families involved went to the media including coverage in the New York Times saying this sub was partially responsible for a role in the deaths of their children. At that time, mods were told by Reddit admin in no uncertain terms to remove drug pics, block sourcing, and keep this a Harm reduction sub. A year later, I was banned for three days for offering to send narcan to someone despite the fact Reddit had highlighted this program. The Admins, law enforcement, and the media monitor this sub. The reason why other subs have not been banned is because they have not been directly mentioned in this way. 

We follow what the admins told us to do. It’s not a personal policy. I personally am pro minimal moderation but I have to follow what was asked. 

Secondly, we’d love a more active voice from people that use drugs actively. Let’s find a way to make that happen., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ea6fob/a_few_things/

📷

📷

Yes, I would recommend one of two things:

1. If your doctor says it’s fine for you to take more, then they should prescribe you more medication so that you are not running out early.  (this is truly what should happen)
2. Ask your doctor to write directly on the prescription (or in their online order) that early fills are acceptable.

📷

I really felt the brief commentary and the links to the guides were good here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/faqs#wiki\_potentiating\_drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/faqs#wiki_potentiating_drugs)

Unfortunately, at least from what I know about pharmacology, there is never any way to maximize the good effects of a drug/medication without also increasing the bad effects. I can tell you that many drugs that affect the brain affect each person’s brain/body differently. Where one person may experience an extremely pleasurable high, another person may become acutely depressed/anxious, nauseous, or even overdose. It will be difficult to completely avoid sedation or respiratory depression while experiencing peak euphoria, especially if you’ve been using for some time and have enough tolerance to not experience as much euphoria anymore. I really want to express that this is coming from someone who has not experimented with these agents on myself so I cannot provide definitive recommendations here. EXCEPT that I strongly encourage not using alone and always having naloxone handy, especially if you’re planning to try to potentiate opioids. Be safe :)

📷

📷

Yep, I usually just recommend finding a different pharmacy if you ever feel you’re being discriminated against or otherwise just not feeling comfortable. It is unfair so many people on chronic pain medications or on medications for opioid use disorder have to deal with so much discrimination, but I can say that some pharmacists are a lot better about it than others. The ones who are rude don’t deserve your business :)

📷

I am not aware of any pharmacy systems that have flags. I have been working to deter health care professionals from using the term “drug seeking” as it is stigmatizing and not a medical term at all. This is one of those uphill battles unfortunately, but I will keep trying!

📷

1. The answer to “Is my insurance company just a bunch of dickheads” for literally ANY reason is ALWAYS YES. :-) To be honest, I am not sure of the regulations here though. I suppose it is possible to have a schedule 5 medication actually not require a prescription, depending on the state. If that is the case, then the pharmacies should all be willing to sell it without a prescription - unfortunately, I’m not familiar with this situation so I can’t be sure one way or the other. What I do know is that insurance companies almost never cover true OTC products, which screws over many of us.
2. See first sentence of #1 ;-) … Yes, the practice is normal and that is predominantly because of the insurance company being unwilling to cover the cost of the medication if it is filled early. Pharmacists can fill meds at any time as long as there is a valid prescription that doesn’t say something like “DO NOT FILL BEFORE X DATE”, but your insurance company just may not cover it if it’s too early. Same goes for C-IIs., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/ih2nro/responses_from_the_pharmacist_with_text_from_the/

TITLE: Question for the Sub, POST BODY: Hi friends, 

I am Tracey, the narcan lady and an all around Harm Reduction enthusiast. I have also been a moderator here for six years. I am currently working on covid community response in my paying job. This leads me to a question. What are your pressing needs in terms of remaining safe during the pandemic? We know overdoses deaths continue to increase and folks are sharing syringes more. I also have been contacted by a few folks here who have been forced to move back in with family who do not know about your drug use. So as a person who designs solutions such as mail based naloxone, I am hoping to look at designing creative solutions. Also to be transparent, harm reduction work is not my paying job. I work in mental health as my day job.

TITLE: Question- What do you wish you would've known, POST BODY: Now that I am approaching another sobriety birthday, I expect to hear a bunch of questions "if you could go back and change it, would you have still done heroin." As much as it may not make sense, I think the answer is still yes. I was facing suicidal depression at that point in my life. For better or worse, it probably saved my life. But I do wish, I would've taken better care of my body. I wish I would've used sterile water and alcohol wipes more. I also wish I would've undertstood that for many people recreational opioid use is just a temporary state, not a lifetime condition.

TITLE: Overdose Prevention on reddit, POST BODY: In 2013, a person invited me to r/opiates because they thought I could add something to the vibrant community here. It became very apparent within days that the way I could really help would be to clandestinely send naloxone/narcan to folks in this community. This has been a labor of love for many years that eventually morphed into the program that is NEXT Distro. I have thrown a lot of my energy into building a national network of programs that can do more than I could. Despite that, I still have boxes of narcan under my bed, I still go to the mailbox nearly every week, and I still spend 10-20 hours of my week communicating with folks around OD prevention. 

In the past 8 years, I have seen people come and people go. I have been notified of many many deaths. BUT/AND I was able to send out thousands of doses that were used to reverse overdoses. That alone keep me going. 

My love to you,
