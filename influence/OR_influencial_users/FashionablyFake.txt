TITLE: Question about IV Suboxone films., POST BODY: So I only had one film left and I don't get my refill for another 2 days (I take 16mgs daily). I read online about shooting them if you only have a little bit. I shot 4mgs and feel a bit better, but after I shot it I felt like my blood had turned to ice and I was freezing all over for about 5 minutes. Has this happened to anyone else?, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/tltwx/question_about_iv_suboxone_films/

BODY: 16mgs isn't necessarily needed for keeping you out of withdrawal. My doctor increased my dose from 12 to 16mgs because I had continued to use, and was not feeling the full functionality of the blocker. I think, for me, it is more of a mental thing, but I know I'm doing much better on 16 than on 12. 
It's really all subjective. And I probably could get by on just 2mgs but it's been so long since I've taken that small of a dose that I was just worried about being sick. In the end, I got my script, so it all worked out. But IV Suboxone is not worth it, in my book... even without the ice-vein feeling.

BODY: My doctor says that using Suboxone and benzos at the same time can be fatal, even in small doses. It is against regulation to prescribe the two together. Personally, I used both together for 3-4 years and was totally fine. I don't remember exactly what reason my doctor gave for it being against regulation, but there are different theories.

TITLE: I am currently on Suboxone, and am thinking about switching to Methadone. Reasons inside..., POST BODY: I am thinking of switching because I can't stop using heroin, even though I only use about twice a month. I feel like Methadone will at least make me feel some dope-like effects, whereas Suboxone just makes me not feel sick. At this point in my life I don't think that I can go without getting high, and I'm wondering if Methadone feels more similar to heroin than Suboxone.  I don't want to continue using heroin but I can't deal with feeling completely sober, either. Does anyone have any advice about this particular topic?

**EDIT:** I just wanted to clarify some things. I **don't** want to continue doing H, but I have a hard time being sober. My question is this: will being on methadone make me feel ***some*** kind of opiate effect? The idea of switching from suboxone to methadone has **nothing** to do with getting back on dope and not having my receptors blocked; I am **not** trying to figure out which medication is best for using on. I just have way too many cravings (and I'm on 16mgs, so my doctor won't put me on more) and I wanted to know if methadone might give me some sort of relief, in opiate-ish form.

TITLE: I need to vent., POST BODY: Sorry about posting so much today. There's been a lot of dope-related activity for me recently and at this moment I have literally no one IRL who I can release all this steam to. You guys are it, right now. 

So I was going to hook someone up today who lives a couple hours away from me (David, we'll say). My other friend (Sam, lets call him) was going to get a bundle from his guy and then David was going to pay him for it when he got here. But Sam was dicking around for hours, not sure if he was going to pick it up for David or not, so I couldn't tell David to make the 2 hour drive here if Sam wasn't going to get it. Sam was sketched out and couldn't decide whether to do it for a while and we talked back and forth about that. 

Then, a little while ago David says that it's too late to come and get it. No big deal--it's getting late, and it's a long drive here and back. I text Sam and tell him the deal is off. Sam asks me to see if David wants to pick it up tomorrow, because if he does then Sam will get it anyway. 

Here is the timeline: 

8:30-- I tell Sam that my friend isn't going to make the drive tonight, so he shouldn't get anything.

8:51--Sam texts and asks if he'll want to come up tomorrow for it. 

8:51-- Sam says "I'm getting it now."

8:53-- I ask David if he's coming up tomorrow, and he says no.

8:54--I text Sam and say that my friend can't get it tomorrow either.

9:10-- Sam calls me, yelling about how he now has an extra bundle that he spent all this money on and it's my fault because I didn't tell him not to get it. He said that I roped him into doing this and now he's out the money and he's really pissed off at me. 

He must have texted me as the money changed hands, because in my town there are no deals that take place within a 3 minute time period. He went ahead and got it without waiting for confirmation from me after I specifically told him that David wasn't going to get it tonight--he assumed that he would come up tomorrow and didn't give me time to respond. And now I'm the bad guy who dicked Sam around all night. 

What the fuck. I'm so angry right now. I hate not being able to talk sense to people. All he has to do is look at our texts and he'll see that he went ahead with something after I told him not to, but now he's mad at me and I'm not even getting to get high after all of this. 

Grrrrr. Sorry about the vent. 

TL;DR: It's 9:33 and I'm not getting the dope I thought I'd be shooting at this moment and my friend is mad at me and I'm stressed out., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1j2hca/i_need_to_vent/

TITLE: I have a stupid question about Suboxone., POST BODY: As some of you know, I am waiting on a package that should have been here a couple days ago. I am on Suboxone, and have to go to a clinic every day to get it. I just skipped 3 days in a row waiting for this goddamn package, so I had to go back today per the clinic's rules. I am prescribed 16mgs (I know it's a lot, *I don't want any shit for it please)*.

I managed to scrape most of the suboxone from underneath my tongue before it dissolved too much. I swallowed that, since the nurses were watching me like a hawk and i couldn't get it out of my mouth. I'd say that only about 4mgs was actually able to dissolve sublingually. 

**My question is this**: Out of the +/- 12mgs that I swallowed, how much do you think made it into my system? One of the nurses had mentioned previously that suboxone does not absorb well if ingested. I'm not sure if that's true, and I know I can google it but I'm looking for personal experiences or advice.

TITLE: I am so frustrated and sick of everything right now and need to vent., POST BODY: Been waiting on this package (shipped out express on 7/30) that I'm sure is not going to come at this point. I haven't gotten high since Sunday or Monday, at least. My whole body is fucking agitated and tense-- I'm not sick, I'm just in panic-attack mode and I have been for the last week. Stupid depression, stupid anxiety, stupid fucking USPS fucked up my medication. I can't handle anything right now. 

I don't have any money-- I mean, I had to steal change from my roommate for bus fare to get to the clinic. I can just imagine having to miss my fucking dose because I can't find $1.25. Forget about food, or cigarettes, or booze. I'm rolling pennies and down to my last .50 cents. 

I haven't worked in over a year because of anxiety/depression issues. I can barely drag myself out of the fucking house anymore. 

My source of income suddenly dried up when I stopped getting my suboxone through a regular doctor and had to start getting it through the methadone clinic. Unfortunately, this happened very suddenly and I was expecting another month's worth, at least, of a regular script. So now I'm fucked with the only people I know who I could get anything off of--they all think I pulled a scam on them or something, since I had used the promise of my refill to get some dope fronted. Now I can't pay them back and they are all on my ass about it and I *can't do anything* about it except tell the clinic that I have to go out of town for a couple days, so they give me take-homes. But 2 days of take-homes is not going to cover my debt, and I'm really new there and I doubt they'll give them to me anyway. 

All week long I've been waiting on one thing or another. My package got fucked up, my Subs got fucked up, and my other $ script also got fucked up and I can't get that until Monday now (it was due this past Wednesday). 

My roommate is pissed off at me because I can't contribute anything to the house right now. I don't want to deal with my family because I have nothing good to say. My "friends" are all dead or gone, or not really friends. This methadone clinic thing is seriously fucking with my head-- it's fucking demeaning that they make everyone go stand about it a dingy little hallway waiting for their medicine, monitoring everything you do and even checking your fucking mouth to make sure that you've taken your dose. I'm 30 fucking years old. 

I just want to be put into suspended animation until I have money or drugs in my pocket. Otherwise, even stepping out of the house to check the mail makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. 

Whatever. Sorry to be so negative. I don't have anywhere else to vent.

TITLE: Stupid irony., POST BODY: I've been fiending for the past week, waiting on a package (yes, STILL) and getting really down and feeling sorry for myself. 

I've been trying to waste most of my dose of suboxone at the clinic in case my package arrives, so I won't have much blocker in my system. Today being Sunday, I figured I'd just take the whole 16mgs since mail doesn't come today. 

Well, I finally was able to score a couple Philly bags tonight. So now that I have it, I can't do it! It's sitting on my desk, just looking at me... I really just want to eat a bunch of sleeping pills and knock myself the fuck out until tomorrow afternoon. 

Oh well, at least I have it, and I know that I'll be using it within 12 hours. The shitty thing is that I'll still have a bunch of blocker in my system! 

Cruel, cruel life. Hopefully the package gets here tomorrow, so I have enough to break through. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1jpx9z/stupid_irony/

EDIT: I realize this is off topic, but you guys don't judge the needle-users and I also trust you. So, I apologize to anyone who doesn't think this should be here, and if the mods want to delete it, I understand. 

Maybe we should start a subreddit that's just for off-topic issues by /r/opiates subscribers. That way, off-topic posts won't piss anyone off, but they'll still reach the right audience. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1jsa5w/adderall_roa/

TITLE: I love renter's rebate!, POST BODY: I just sent in my taxes (very late, I know) and with the renter's rebate, I'll be getting back $1300! Of course, I have to split this with my roommate because it's all from the rebate (I actually would have owed about 200 without the rebate) but I'm psyched! The website says to allow for 8-10 weeks processing so I'll have something to look forward to in October, at the latest. 

I am planning on hitting up SR as soon as the check clears. I haven't had money in so long and I have big plans for this. Hopefully it will start to multiply...

I couldn't efile because you need to mail in the renter's rebate form. Does anyone have experience with how long it takes to get a mailed refund back? I'm hoping that it's actually sooner than the projected 8-10 weeks. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1jw2ha/i_love_renters_rebate/

Are you so broke that you can't come up with a few bucks to buy new ones? You get the picture... I was able to get some extra today and can send some out to a *few* people. PM me if you need them. 

If you do end up needing some, please include a description of what the needle availability is like in your town/state... For instance, do you have a needle exchange (and can't get to it for whatever reason), do the pharmacies sell needles, is it illegal to carry them without a prescription?

TITLE: Revenge???, POST BODY: I got ripped off the other day by this asshole of a kid... He tried to tell me that he had to run with my money and of course, I said fuck that. So I went with him in his car and he got out to talk to his people and came back saying that they only had a couple of the bags with them and he would have to go meet them at their house later, and whoops, he gave them all the money. 

It was only $60, but I had spent the entire day hustling my ass off to get it, and it was the first time in almost a month that I had money of my own. I know where this kid lives, and he lives with his parents who don't know he's a junkie scumbag. Judging from how they treat his brother, who they DO know is a junkie scumbag, they will make this kids life HELL if they find out. So I'm thinking of going to their house and demanding the money and threatening to tell his parents if he doesn't pay me back. 

What do you guys think? If I could beat his ass I would, but that's not an option for me unless I get a guy friend to help me out... I hate confrontations and I really don't want to ruin this kid's life for $60, but he's a fucking slimeball.

TITLE: Questions about loperamide, suboxone, and precipitated withdrawals., POST BODY: This morning I kicked myself into precipitated withdrawals by dosing suboxone too soon. I'm not going to get into how that felt--all I can say is that i'm glad it didn't last that long. 

The PWs are over now, but I still feel really shitty. I'm hesitant to take more suboxone, although if it's already kicked everything off my receptors, should I worry about more PWs? 

I want to take loperamide, but I'm worried that if that doesn't work, I won't be able to redose on suboxone. I'm sorry this is confusing, i'm really not feeling well. 

I guess my questions are: 

* Will taking more suboxone send me back into PWs? 
* If I do take lope and it doesn't help, can I dose suboxone on top of it or will that make me sick? 

thanks.

EDIT: I have taken 80mgs of loperamide and still feeling shitty. Can I take 2-4mgs of suboxone, or will the precipitated withdrawals come back? , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1luwxg/questions_about_loperamide_suboxone_and/

TITLE: Freaked out and shaking in my boots., POST BODY: I'm sorry if this is incoherent right now, but I just got home and I'm freaked out and really really angry. I just went head to head with two different dudes.... 

I was out with a friend of mine, picking her up from downtown and we were walking to my friends car when we heard a skateboard coming down the street behind us. She looked back and it was this guy who has apparently been stalking her. He thinks he's a fucking gangster and is involved with the crews who come up to my town to sell drugs from the city. He is also part of a group of people which includes one guy who actually set my friend on fire this summer after she refused to be gangbanged by a group of guys. She still has massive scabs and scars on her chest and arms. 

Anyway, this asshole comes up and skates around us, in front of us, and stops and walks up to my friend. He starts trying to talk to her, and she's so freaked out she can't really say anything to him. She is too scared to tell him to fuck off. I didn't really believe that he had been fucking with her until tonight, until I saw how he was acting towards her. My friends car was up the block and he was following us, and I was trying to keep myself between him and my friend. Finally I told him that she obviously didn't want to talk to him and told him to leave us alone. He didn't answer me and acted like I wasn't even there, and kept talking shit to her, saying that she better not show her face around that area unless she started dealing with him. Finally I got her in the car-- I had to practically move this guy out of the way so she could get into the car because he was blocking her door. Whatever. He was a fucking tool and I don't give a shit if he thinks he's tough. Yeah, I'm a girl and he could do some awful shit to me, but I'm sick and tired of people thinking it's okay to harass girls and give them to people to fuck. 

So we get into the car and off we go. I was with another friend of mine (we'll call him D) who I was middling for.  My friend J had the connect. I assume he made some money out of it because when we went into the apartment to get the bundle, he got some money back from the dealer. J was drunk and pissed off for whatever reason. We get into the car to go back to my house and J asked my friend D if he could get a bag for hooking him up with the bundle. D says that he can't spare one because he was already hooking me up for doing it. I KNOW that J made some money off the deal because I saw him getting money back from the dealer. Also, we had already worked out pricing and everything BEFORE we went to hook up, and J seemed fine with everything until after the deal went down. 

So J flipped the fuck out. He started screaming at D, leaning all the way forward in the backseat so he was right next to D's head and screaming in his face, "You better give me something NOW!" I was in the passenger seat and turned completely around, trying to calm J down. I had to wedge my body in between the front seats so J couldn't hit D. I had D stop and told J that he had to get out of the car. He continued flipping out and screaming and trying to push past me to get to D. I had my arm out across the gap between the seats and he pushed my arm so hard that it felt like it rotated in it's socket. It hurts like hell right now. So J was all up in my face and refusing to get out of the car. I had gotten out at this point and was trying to pull him out of the back seat. There were people on the sidewalk asking me if I was okay. J was still screaming and I thought he was going to punch me in the face, he had his fucking arm up and fist closed and almost fucking hit me. 

I got home finally and go into my room with my one bag out of this whole fucking debacle. I've been sick all day and I'm fucking shaking and freaked out and pissed off. I go to my room and my roommate comes in immediately to ask me if I'm using again. All I could do was laugh in his face. He asked me what was wrong and I just told him that I had to deal with a couple of assholes. He immediately starts asking me if he's fucking safe at the house, and if anyone is going to come here, and if he's in danger, and if I'm fucking using drugs. I can't fucking deal with this shit. I'm not a fucking fighter. I will fight if I have to but one girl taking on two drunk violent asshole within a half an hour time span is too much for me. 

I just had to get this out. All my roommate cares about is if they are going to come here to get me. He doesn't give a shit that I just got shoved around and almost hit by a crazy person. I'm fucking out of here on October 1st anyway. That bag didn't even get me fucking high. I'm still shaking.  , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1mr6zn/freaked_out_and_shaking_in_my_boots/

TITLE: Off-topic post about my crappy living situation., POST BODY: Last night my roommate had a little temper tantrum and trashed the living room. I am not completely innocent in all of this, but here's the deal: I am moving out on October 1st, hopefully going to Portland, OR but things aren't quite lined up yet so I will need to find a place to stay for about 2 weeks. I decided to not be a bitch and ask my roommate if that was okay, because he'll be staying in the apartment by himself. He flipped out and basically ranted at me for an hour about how much of a burden I am on him, and how psyched up he's gotten about having the apartment to himself, and how he really needs "time alone." 

Here's the thing, though. I am culpable in this because he has been helping me out financially for the past couple months, sharing his food and booze and cigarettes with me when I run out of money towards the end of every month. I feel REALLY badly about this. I know part of his concern about me staying is that he doesn't want to have to carry me any more, but I will A) be paying rent, and B) i'll have my security deposit back so I'll have cash, and C) I get food stamps on the 1st. So that shouldn't be an issue. Plus, he's been bitching about not having an easy time coming up with the full rent himself so me staying an extra 2 weeks would help him out a lot in that regard. 

I could potentially stay at my parents house, but here's why I don't want to: 

*It is completely in the middle of nowhere and I do not have a car, nor can I borrow a car from my parents because they won't let me drive it without a license. I will be stuck on the top of a dirt road and I won't be able to even go to the store on my own. For 2 weeks, if not longer. 

*My father sleeps on the couch in the living room (don't even ask) which is right at the bottom of a very creaky set of century-old farmhouse stairs. It is almost impossible to go up and down the stairs without waking him up, so when he goes to bed at 11:30 I am effectively stuck in my room, unable to go down to the fridge, to the computer, or outside to smoke a cigarette. 

*My cell phone doesn't work at my parents house. They do have a landline, but there is NO privacy. 

*I won't even be able to watch TV if I want to because of the open floor plan and the fact that my parents hate TV (I'm not a huge fan either), but I also won't be able to use my own computer because there is no wiring upstairs in my room. 

*My grandfather and my aunt will be there for a week at the same time as me. This will be UBER annoying. 

So, instead of just TELLING my roommate that I was going to stay another 2 weeks, which I feel I could have done because it was MY apartment to begin with and HE moved in with me a couple years after I had been living here. So I was really just being conscientious by asking his permission. 

But he sat there, unwilling to say either yes or no, and for an hour he berated me about what a selfish person I am, what a burden I am to him, how he REALLY "needs time alone" (as if he won't have it after I leave). Finally I got sick of being told that I'm an awful person and I got up and told him that I wasn't going to sit there and listen to how awful I am, and that if it wasn't okay to just TELL me it's not okay and that will be that. I then went into my room and shut the door. A split second later, I hear all sorts of crashing noises from the living room. This went on for a few seconds and then he slammed out of the apartment. I went into the living room and everything was trashed. He knocked books out of the bookcases, the coffee table was upside down and sideways, a side table was broken, the ashtrays were spread on the floor, books were everywhere, beer bottles had spilled, etc., etc. Shit had been knocked off the wall. The cats were under my bed, hiding. 

So now I am in a really tough spot. I could just tell him to suck it and that I'm staying anyway, because I feel like that is my right as long as I can pay my own way. But I really don't want to deal with the awkwardness. I understand that he really wants the apartment to himself, but I'm leaving soon and he can have it then. It's two fucking weeks. He accused me of not being willing to live in a "kind of uncomfortable" situation at my parents house, but he doesn't realize that it's not just sort-of uncomfortable-- it's downright isolating and suicide-inducing. Really. I feel like killing stuff when I have to stay there for more than a couple nights. It's even worse when my extended family will be there. 

And also, he thinks he's the one who is so displaced living here with me, but I stay in my room on my computer constantly because he is always in the living room, in front of the TV, watching whatever he wants to watch without a thought about sharing the remote. I am unable to have friends over when he is here because he's even more antisocial than I am. Even when I do hang out in the living room with him, he will make phone calls and sit there talking on his phone without a thought about going into his room to give himself privacy and to not disrupt me. Instead, I go into my room. It's bullshit, but I've felt so bad about his helping me out that I have put up with it. But now I'm screwed. I know I'll probably be at my parents for more than two weeks, so I wanted to split the extra time between my apartment and their house. 


I'm really sorry about the wall of text. I really needed to get this out, and I like you guys so I wanted to post here. I'm really fucked. It doesn't really sound that bad, but the reality of it is much worse than it sounds. I literally feel I am trapped, smothered, and dead when I stay at my parents for very long, and it will be even worse with grandpa and my aunt there. 

TL;DR: Roommate had a temper tantrum, and I have to stay at my parents house in the middle of nowhere, literally, without a car, phone, computer, or TV. The closest store is 15 minutes away. Driving. I can't leave my room after 11:30pm or I will wake up my father. I will be trapped there, literally. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/1n4xow/offtopic_post_about_my_crappy_living_situation/

TITLE: My first lucky day in about 3 weeks., POST BODY: It's not much, but I've been stuck in the middle of nowhere with no car and no money. My Adderall script is due today at a pharmacy an hour away, so I had no way of getting it. I remembered that my dope-girl likes to trade with me, so I called her and she agreed to pick up my script and drive them to me, an hour away, so we can trade. She's a big hippie chick and I do trust her, so in a couple hours I will have a bunch of dope! For free (well, sorta). 

Also, at the same time, another friend of mine is bringing me something to tide me over. Yay! I had to share. 

And ALSO, last night I finally got in touch with my sister who had hinted that she is willing to let me stay with her on the West Coast while I find a job and place of my own to live. So I'm researching plane tickets and am moving cross-country in the next couple weeks! I'm actually happy right now!

TITLE: Just some thoughts..., POST BODY: ...that i can't really share with many IRL people. 

I've been staying at my parents house for the past month, between the time when my lease ended and when I can move cross-country. It's been really hard, in part because I'm broke and they live in the middle of nowhere and I don't have a car or any real friends here. But also because there are ghosts here for me. 

I didn't have the easiest time growing up here, by any means, and there are memories in this house that I don't want to remember, and no way of escaping them. And I also lived here with my boyfriend who OD'd 11 years ago, and he is all over this house too, and recently I was cleaning out my closet and found a lot of stuff of his that I didn't know was here. Like his notebook, which has love letters to me that I have never read before. And every time I go outside I remember me and him smoking cigarettes out there, and every time I fall asleep I remember me and him sleeping. And I can't talk about this with anyone because I don't want people to know that it still fucking kills me to think about. 

I have to get out of here. Or talk to someone about it. Too many memories, too many ghosts, and I can't escape, and I can't get high, and it's too fucking much.

BODY: When you say "it didn't change much," that might be because it was actually starting to make you sick on your own... it most likely takes a little bit of time for the bupe to kick the opiates off your receptors, so that might be why. I don't know if that is scientifically accurate, but it makes sense in my head, at least.

BODY: I've had endocarditis twice. I really doubt that anyone can tell if the bacteria came from the dope itself or from the cooker, needle, or the person's skin. If you are worried about getting endo (which you should be--it's fucking hellish) then there are several other safety measures you can take that (in my opinion) would work a lot better than heating the dope... Like, always use alcohol pads before you shoot up, use new cookers every time, use new needles every time, use sterile water...

BODY: My advice is to go to your nearest Planned Parenthood and talk to their doctors and counselors. You can talk to them about the health concerns, and they will also help you decide what you want to do with the pregnancy. 

My advice is to talk to the Planned Parenthood people **before** talking any more with the baby's father. Normally I wouldn't say that, but I don't want him influencing your decision any more than he already has... His concerns are valid, because he may not have the time, energy, or money to provide for another kid, but he also doesn't have the right to demand that you have an abortion. 

Just remember that getting an abortion now doesn't mean that you can't have kids later. I know that sounds really dumb, but thinking that actually took a lot of the pressure off for me... I knew that I could always decide to get pregnant again, but I could never change my mind about NOT having the kid.

TITLE: Privacy violated, but saved by quick thinking., POST BODY: so I have been staying at my parents house for a while. today I was gone for the day and when I got back, my parents sat me down for a talk. apparently my mother went into my room when I was gone and found a bag of needles that I had hidden underneath a chair. they know I used to use but think I've been clean for a couple years. I thought fast and said that I had found them in my stuff after I moved back in with my parents, and I hadn't gotten rid of them yet because a) I forgot I even had them, and b) I didn't want to go to the needle exchange because I used to work in social services and would like to again, and a lot of former or possibly future clients use the needle exchange so I was unwilling to go there. 

I am 31 years old. I know it's pathetic that I'm staying with my parents, but I've had some complicated health and wellness issues that I couldn't deal with on my own. but holy shit! my mother actually searched my room! I haven't even been using much more than one every couple months. and she did say that she was sure I wasn't using but finding the needles scared her. 

I feel like I'm 15 years old again. it's bad enough that I'm staying with my parents, and now I have to deal with having the last shred of privacy completely nullified.

BODY: Me too, and I'm only clean now out of necessity (no money, no connects, no car, etc, etc). When I'm sober, my head tries its best to kill me and I get really, really scared of myself and of what I might possibly do to myself. I've been drinking a lot to keep the self-hate to a minimum, but it's not the same at all. And it doesn't really work. I keep living through each shitty day but pretty much only because of my family. My sister just had a baby (her first, and probably only kid because she's 35) and I don't want to do anything to make her upset right now, but in the back of my head, suicide is always an option. My family doesn't know how I feel but are still pushing me to see a psychiatrist and they don't understand how absolutely impossible it is for me to force myself to share these feelings with anyone. I'm only doing it now because it's mostly anonymous. With doctors and shrinks, I just clam up and pretend like everything is okay, and I get away with it because I seem educated and intelligent and I know what to say to get them off my back. Like all of us, I am really good at faking.

I really hate that people can't buy clean rigs from a pharmacy sometimes. This is how infections are spread.

If I remember right, individual stores can decide whether or not they want to sell them. It's unfortunately up to their discretion.

BODY: I'm from Vermont and there are only, like, 4 rehabs here. The one I went to took Medicaid and was primarily state funded but it rocked. I guess I'm lucky to live in a state where state-sponsered programs are better than privately run facilities. Of course, I still have to live here, so maybe it's a toss-up. 

Also I have never heard of a methadone clinic here that charges its patients. Maybe if they are uninsured but the state health insurance is actually quite good and not hard to qualify for. 
So all you bitches need to move here, stat! Even though the job prospects suck and you'll probably lose a few teeth just by crossing the state line... it's all good. Another benefit is you won't be able to afford the heroin, so goodbye habit! Yup. I love my state.

TITLE: Regarding my dead fiancee., POST BODY: So I was going to get married to this guy who I was totally head over heels in love with in 2001. I pretty much gave everything up to this guy because I was so in love with him and wanted to be with him no matter what. We were living underneath a bridge in Seattle at the time, and strung out on dope really badly. My parents wanted me to come back home and get clean and I told them that I wouldn't even consider it unless he could come back with me. They had never met him before, and knew that he was pretty much the only reason I was a homeless junkie, but they agreed that he could come back east and move in with them. 

So we moved in with them and a year later, he was dead from an overdose. The only time I met his family was at the funeral. They live in California, and we met in Seattle and then moved to Vermont, so we never had a chance to visit them. When I went out for the funeral, they were really great and didn't blame me in the slightest, which I was thankful for. 

Anyway. He died in 2003 and I haven't had any contact with his family since then. I just found some pictures though, and I want his family to have them. I found his little sister on Facebook and sent her a message. 

I still really love this guy. He was fucking perfect and I just feel really weird because there aren't too many people that I know who knew him... There are some people still in Seattle where we met, but I'm really only facebook friends with a few of them. There were a few people here in Vermont who knew and loved him, but I really feel like he only existed for me. I don't think that too many other people have strong memories of him and on one hand I would LOVE to hear from his family because they are a part of him, and on the other hand I am really scared that no one remembers him. That I'm the only person who ever really knew him. 

Just venting. I sent his sister a message and a friend request. We'll see if she responds. I wouldn't blame her if she didn't want anything to do with me since I'm pretty much the reason why he's dead. I couldn't save him and I handed him the shot that killed him. 

EDIT: [Pictures just for the hell of it.](http://imgur.com/a/tKiED)

BODY: she accepted my friend request, which was good. But I asked her about Johnny's sister Jen, who shared the same dad but had a different mother than Mary (the little sister). I told mary that I wanted to find Jen and she messaged me back saying that she and her family have fallen out of touch with her and don't have a name to give me. I know that they know Johnny's other sisters name, but obviously Mary doesn't want to connect me with her. It's really their prerogative so I'm not going to push it. 

It's been 11 years since he died and you'd think I'd be over it by now but it' s been hitting me hard tonight and I'm basically a pool of tears and vodka right now.

BODY: A couple years ago I was hanging out with this acquaintance of mine named Doug. He was the friend of a friend and I didn't really know him that well. He just randomly asked me what I was doing that day and I told him I didn't have any plans. He said, "Well, I'm driving to California (from the East Coast) if you want to come." I wasn't working at the time so I thought about it for about two minutes and decided what the hell, I may as well go. He was going out to California to surprise his girlfriend on their anniversary.
This guy had some mental issues, and we were also both heroin addicts. I was on medication for maintenance but figured I'd take a little break and get high a few times. We bought a decent amount and hit the road.
Well. Apparently Doug gets delusional sometimes. We spent one night in a hotel and I fall asleep and wake up to see him being led into the room by a hotel employee. All of our needles and drugs were laying out in plain view. The employee asked me if I knew the guy. Of course, I said that I did. Doug had apparently wandered away from the room in a sleep-deprived heroin haze, forgotten the room number and the room key, and he couldn't remember what his name was. The employee had to tell Doug to look in his wallet for his ID to get his room information. I took custody of Doug and of the car keys and we get on our way.
We end up running out of dope around Colorado. Doug has the wonderful idea to look up escorts and hookers in the area where we were, and try to find some drugs through them. He has me going through these websites (Craigslist, Backpages) and giving him numbers to call. Finally after calling about 20 different people we hook up with this woman who can't get us heroin but can get us meth. We decide to get that instead.
At this point Doug has not slept since we left the East Coast but he was acting much more sane and since I don't have my license, I hand the keys over to him again and we set off. We are driving down the interstate and all of a sudden, Doug starts talking about how he is going to run this car off the road. He freaks out, pulls over into the breakdown lane, and starts telling me that he is going to *turn around * and go back to the hotel that we were at because people were out to get him. I coax him from the drivers seat before he actually does turn the car around and go the wrong way down the interstate.
Finally we make it to California. We had busted ass to get there by July 1st because that was Doug and his girl's anniversary. We roll into town and cannot find this chick anywhere. We drive around and around looking for her, going to her friends houses and calling non-stop. Finally we get in touch with her and go to meet her at a bus station. She walks up to the car with absolutely no smile on her face and with her 3 kids. Turns out, this chick is homeless and does not have a place for us to stay. Doug, being the nice guy that he is, decides to get us motel rooms. One for me and one for him and his girl to have some quality time together.
The girl had other ideas. Apparently her entire family is also homeless and needs a place to stay. Doug, being the nice pushover that he is, rented an extra room for her mother and her sister and her sister's kid. But wait!!! All the kids must stay with Doug and his girl in their room because the mother and the sister are hooking out of the motel room. They are all meth-heads also, so they are smoking with the little kids running around in the same room.
We stayed for 3 days, during which time Doug had ZERO time alone with this girl, and she would borrow his car to go "run errands," leaving him alone in his room watching HER kids for HOURS at a time.
Finally, after days of listening to him be heartbroken about this dumb bitch, and after days of listening to her call her own kids "niggers" and threaten to beat them, and shout at them all the time, I had a heart-to-heart with him and he agreed that we should get the fuck out of there and back to the East Coast.
On the way back it was discovered that this girl had stolen checks and a digital scale from his luggage. We drove from California without stopping more than a few hours here and there to catch naps. There were some random drug deals along the way to sustain ourselves.

BODY: If it's making you sick, try a lower dose like 2mgs. The only problem with the lower doses IMO is that the cravings are stronger and you know that you could potentially break through with another opiate if you really wanted to. 8mgs was pretty much right for me to take away cravings and make me trust the blocker but again, if it's making you sick then start out really low.

I used "Fake" because I meant for this account to be my opiate throwaway account and I had another one that I meant to use for the rest of reddit (didn't end up happening, I pretty much only use this account now). And "Fashionably" because I thought it sounded good with Fake, and because I'm like the LEAST fashionable person ever so I thought it was sort of funny. 

I actually really hate this username now and I really want to make a new one but I've been using it here for close to 3 years I think so I don't want to lose it.

There is a link in the sidebar for directions, and then you can do a subreddit search for plugging guides. I'm pretty sure you can plug as long as you do the extraction, but again, I've never done it before and am just going off of what I've heard other people have done.

The last time my parents got a Jehovah's Witness at their house, they pulled up in their car and the dog immediately went right up to the drivers side, barking really aggressively. The dude cracked his window about an inch and yelled out "does your dog bite?" My dad, who is 6'3" with a crazy mustache and long hair, just looks at them and says, "Yup." Then he walked away, leaving the dog slavering at the car window. They haven't had another witness since.

BODY: My dad could be a seriously scary guy. There was one time that I sort of accidentally had a huge party at their pond when I was 15 or so. It was supposed to only be me and a few of my good friends, but someone told someone who told someone, etc, and a shitload of people ended up showing up. My father came outside to the pond and said, "I'm going back inside to get my gun and everyone better be gone when I get back!" There was a mass exodus after that... people still talk about that and it's been over 15 years.

He used to drink a LOT, so that probably contributed. I would always have to prep my friends when bringing them home to meet him for the first time... it could get somewhat scary/embarrassing. I'd just tell them not to get offended, and whatever they did, DO NOT call him "sir". Crazy old coot.

But yeah, he's doing much better now. Still crazy but not in a dangerous sort of way. My mother and he have a pretty good relationship now and my sisters have a good relationship with him now too.

TITLE: I actually had a great night on New Years Eve., POST BODY: I live in the middle of nowhere and none of my friends live anywhere near me, except for one who is half an hour away. For the past year I've been isolating myself, not hanging out with or talking to anyone, not going out, feeling awful and depressed. 

My friend who lives near me is a really close friend, like my platonic soulmate. We've known each other for 20 years and will tell each other things that we'd never breathe a word of to anyone else. Both of us are pretty fucked in the head, and it's not unusual for us to go months inseparable and then for no reason stop hanging out or talking for several more months. 

Anyway lately I've thought I've been fine with my lack of friends. The way I've felt lately is just too hard to cover up and I no longer have the energy to fake it anymore. Hence the isolation. 

Anyway this guy, Kris, just randomly calls me at 2:30am on New Years Day. He tells me that he's coming to pick me up and take me back to his place. I was a bit skeptical, not sure that I could deal with interaction, but I am so glad I went. This kid requires no effort on my part to hang out with, and he gets me. I told him stuff and opened up to him in a way that I didn't think was possible for me. I can't believe that I'd forgotten what a comfortable social interaction is. For the first time in at least a year, I was actually happy and felt really lucky to have someone in my life. It really made me feel so much more human, and talking to him about my issues made me feel like I might actually be able to fix them. 

So we just hung out and snuggled platonically and drank booze, and he gave me a a bunch of Ritalin, some klonopin (which I fucking love) and a suboxone he randomly had laying around! All for free, just for the hell of it!

It's nice to realize that I still have some humanity left after this horrible year. 

And my dank poppy seeds are arriving today, although yesterday morning I took the suboxone, which was stupid but I didn't even think about it. It was a full 8mgs 24hrs ago. You guys think I should wait on making tea? I would really hate to wait but it would suck to waste it. 

Thanks for reading. I mainly just wanted to share the one positive thing that's happened to me in a really long time. Hang on to your friends, they can make everything better when you've otherwise lost hope. 

Love you all., PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2r3qe8/i_actually_had_a_great_night_on_new_years_eve/

BODY: I had meth psychosis once when I was living in this tiny one bedroom with a bunch of squatter gutterpunks. I had been up for days and they finally made me go try to lay down and sleep and forbade anyone from bothering me. I lay in bed tweaking and I could hear them all talking about how they were sick of me and we're going to call the cops and have them come bust me. I climbed out the window to escape and ended up lurking about town, convinced that the Freemasons were after me and were trying to kill me, and that they had surveillance on me in the form of people in parked cars, and they would rotate the cars every half hour or so. Also everyone with a black umbrella was a Freemason (this was Seattle, everyone had black umbrellas). And then it got really really foggy and I was convinced it was the police using fog machines to try to trap me. 

Another time I thought I had crystals coming out of my skin and I actually made a post on /r/drugs about it. I'm still sort of convinced that there were crystals coming through my pores. 

I don't do speed very often.

BODY: You can cut the patch into little, tiny pieces (like 20 pieces for a 50mcg patch) and put the piece on your gums.

Do you shoot? I have shot those before by putting a piece in a cooker with vinegar and letting it sit for a while. 

If you use either of these methods, please be sure to just use a tiny tiny piece of the patch at first. Fent is fucking strong, and dangerous.

And to answer your question... People get hooked on substances not because they don't have anyone to love or who loves them, but because opiates remove pain. Physical, mental, emotional. A lot of junkies have secondary mental disorders like anxiety and depression that are really difficult to live with, and drugs can mask those things. For me, my mind is only calm and quiet and I only feel comfortable with heroin in my bloodstream. Believe it or not, but dope can really improve your quality of life.

TITLE: Gross question regarding PST and vomit., POST BODY: Don't worry, this isn't one of "those" PST posts. 

So. I have been drier than the Mojave desert lately and was able to get a couple pounds of poppyseeds. I made the tea and gulped down some of it. Unfortunately, it was so fucking nasty that it triggered a gag reflex and immediately after having swallowed it, I puked it back up. I managed to puke into a glass I had next to my bed. 

See where this is going? 

I haven't eaten yet today so there was nothing in my stomach to come out with the vomit. So I'm wondering what the hell I should do. I don't want to waste more than half of my already small yield, but I also don't want to drink my own vomit. This seems to be a low point in my opiate career. Granted, it wasn't really in my stomach for longer than a couple seconds, so is it technically vomit?

BODY: It was one of those tall pint glasses. I think I will drink it. It's not like there were chunks or anything in it. It's just... drinking vomit... but junkies do what junkies have to do, right? It's sort of like when your needle clogs after having registered and you empty the blood/dope mix out the back of the rig into a cooker so you can pick the blood clot out and draw the rest back up. 

Yeah, now that I think about it this is really not the grossest thing I've ever done for opiates. I feel better now. I'm gonna chug it. Thanks.

There are a lot of people here who are clean but still identify with the lifestyle, and we all know relapse is a huge part of the game. This sub is also much different than the recovery sub and people may feel more comfortable posting about their relapse here instead.

BODY: I've had endocarditis twice. It is a bacterial infection of the heart valves, and my lungs were also infected. It is caused by bacteria from the skin getting into the bloodstream from IV drug use. I was told that I was very close to dying by the time I showed up at the ER. 

The first time I had it, I was in the hospital for 3 weeks, in and out of consciousness, with IV antibiotics and several blood transfusions. I very narrowly escaped needing heart surgery to replace the infected heart valve. I had to be on IV antibiotics for 2 months after leaving the hospital, which means that they put in a PICC line-- it's basically an IV port, and they gave me syringes full of antibiotics that I had to put into the PICC line every 8 hours. I was so weak from being sick that I had to stay at my parents house for two months after getting out of the hospital. 

My heart and my lungs are permanently damaged now. I have a really hard time being physically active because I get out of breath really easily. I have an irregular heartbeat now and I can actually feel it skipping beats fairly often. It feels like it stutters. 

The whole ordeal was really really scary, with lasting physical consequences. I am also at an increased risk of infection now. I'm not quite sure how that works but that's what I was told.

And then they shoved a camera down my throat and gave me drugs that made me forget the whole procedure. Not quite surgery, but close. And then when they couldn't get a vein for an IV and had to do a "cut down", which is basically what it sounds like where they cut down into your arm to try to get to a vein. They failed and had to ship me to a hospital an hour away in an ambulance. My arm looked like a Christmas turkey after that but left a cool scar. I like scars.

BODY: If you have an extra 5 or 10 bucks, go to Walmart or somewhere and get him a big bottle of generic loperamide. It's brand name is Imodium, but don't get that. The generic is cheaper and easier to swallow. Give him 10 pills, and if he's not feeling better in 2 hours give him 10 more. This can almost completely take care of his withdrawals for about 24 hours. 

There's a withdrawal survival guide in the sidebar of /r/opiates. You should have him check it out but I totally swear by the lope. His habit is small enough that the above amount should help him. If it doesn't he can keep redosing but it takes a while to kick in and he shouldn't take them more than 4 days in a row because he can become dependent on them too. He should take less and less as the days go on. 

I hope this helps. And like I said before, if you think it's worth it the. Stay with him, but he's not going to change unless he really wants to, and even if he does really want to, that doesn't mean he'll get right up and go to rehab. It takes a long time sometimes between deciding to get clean and actually being able to make yourself do it.

TITLE: My fellow junkies, my friend and I need your good vibes!, POST BODY: So I'm sure I've thrashed this subject to death here, BUT as many of you no doubt know from my constant posts on the subject, my best friend is in jail awaiting sentencing on distribution charges. He's been in for 10 months and his sentencing date is Tuesday. 

Well, he was transferred back to our state last week and had visiting hours today. I braved a snowstorm to drive the hour to go visit him. Upon arrival at the jail, I was told that he was in the secure holding facility and unable to receive visitors. 

I petitioned the dude on duty and got him to radio the ward to double check, as I had been told by his sister that he was able to have visitors. The dude working was an old guy, balding, paunchy, very nice, with a slight stutter. He acquiesced, although as I had arrived during head count I had to wait about ten minutes. 

I had my fingers crossed in my lap as I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, the unit returned his call and said that Yes! He was available for visitors! 

I was divested of my hoodie and my jacket; my shoes were poked and prodded to make sure I had no contraband. I set off the metal detector, sincere when I said I had nothing in my pockets and no belt. Of course, it was my underwire bra. How embarrassing to be a female and visiting a jail... 

I was directed down an empty hallway, with no guards and no directions. I had no idea where to go. Passing through two locked doors, I arrived in a large open room. Unsure of where to go from there, I shuffled around aimlessly, expecting at any time to be ushered unceremoniously out of the jail and back into the snowstorm without seeing my friend. 

Anyway. I finally found the right room (they let me wander around without saying anything... does that mean I can break my friend out?) 

I entered this large room with long tables set up, chairs on either side and a plexiglass partition in the middle of the table. Two guards were inside the door; they barked at me to sit. I sat. 

I don't do well with authority. Uniforms confuse and scare me. Every crime that I have ever committed (they are legion) ran through my brain so loudly I was sure the guards could hear. I sat on my side of the table, hopefully peeking out the door to try to see my friend. I listened to the people visiting on either side of me; one man, who looked and sounded mean, berated a woman who I'm sure was his wife or girlfriend about his tax return. I had watched him walk into the room and up to her; he didn't smile once. She had a groveling sort of tone of voice and I felt sorry for her, wanted to take her aside and make sure she was okay....

My friend came into the room and sat in front of me. We only had 45 minutes to talk, because of the delay when I arrived, but it had been about a year since I had seen him and the time flew by. There was a person near me who was visiting another inmate, and a few minutes into our visit he calls out, greeting my friend... Leave it to Jay to know a totally random visitor in a jail an hour away from our town. He knows everyone. He is in jail now with many, many people who he knows. I am glad of this familiarity; it means he's not alone, like he was when he was out of state. 

His sentencing is Tuesday. He explains how his lawyer thinks there is a good chance he will be released after the court date. I am stunned, happy, jubilant, incredulous. Jay is always optimistic, and I am always pessimistic, but he was caught on tape selling drugs to an informant, and pled guilty to distribution charges which can carry up to ten years jail time.... Plus, he has a long laundry list of other convictions, including (but not limited to) assault on a police officer, which they don't take kindly to. 

But I'm hoping that, for once, his optimism will pay off. He has letters from his non-junkie friends attesting to the fact (or presumption) that he wants to stay clean, that he has seen the error of his ways, that he will be good from now on. I am doubtful, but hopeful. I know this man. I have known him since we were 12 years old; I have been his best friend, and sometimes lover, for 20 years. I cross my fingers, I hope like fucking hell he will get out and I can have my only friend back. As much as he has fucked me over in the past, I fucking love this person. 

SO!!! Please please please cross your fucking junkie fingers and hope that he gets out on Tuesday! I need good vibes coming our way... 

Sorry for the length. I drank a bunch of vodka. 

XOXO

Stupid fucking kid, I felt like laughing at him or hitting him but I didn't think either choice would do much for the prospect of getting high, which isn't looking too good anyway. 

So nothing happened with the dope but somehow we ended up with 15 hits of acid. I just dropped one to sample it and it hasn't hit me yet. 

TWEAK. So I dropped a hit of acid last night and at first I thought it was pretty weak, but it was just a very slow to come on high that was actually very good. I think I laid on my bed all night, listened to portishead and played with my candle. I just thought it would be okay to go out for cigarettes and coffee but I probably should have stayed inside. 

I sketched along the sidewalk like yet another crackhead who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing. Somehow managed to grunt "Marlboro reds" to the cashier and ask for matches, too. What a joke.... 

I did have visuals but I can't say if they were good or not. Had brief notions of "maybe I shouldn't pollute my body with drugs" but then dismissed them because LIFE JUST WOULDNT BE AS BEARABLE. 

 I haven't slept all night, which means neither has Luna, who is even now trying to leap onto my pen. Poor Luna. Look, I even made my goddamn cat a crackhead. Quarantine me, I'm a danger to myself and my poor pets, who are the only creatures I let close enough to touch me at this point. I need to find a life outside my head.

TITLE: Love letter to Seattle, POST BODY: August 7, 2001

Every once in a while there is a day that I just can't get through-- a day where my smiles are always faked and my personality is shallow and I feel hollow. 

Today is one of those days. 

And I sit here waiting for something to hit me, some stroke of genius but I haven't written anything in forever that's worth reading. I guess that's what you get when your real life is temporarily on hold and nothing interests you-- not even dreaming. And you look in every direction and there's nothing there that you connect with, you return to the places you've been and you feel like a stranger and you try and you try and you try but you cannot come up with a place where you've ever been completely happy, but staying in the place where you're at is wearing and tearing at your nerves but what can you do? 

So you do the one thing you know how to do well, which is hiding inside of yourself and not letting anyone near, except this backfires as soon as you WANT to open yourself up and can't because you've pumped yourself so full of drugs that your emotions have shriveled, along with your confidence, and you're fucked. 

So. 

Grow up and stop doing dope, 'cos they're on to you anyway and your arms hurt and you wanted a car, remember? To fly out of this trap in. Just swallow what's left of your pride and endure, endure, endure. You'll find a place to dream in soon enough. 

And besides, it's not the place, it's you. And if you want something badly enough, it'll happen, right? Right. I've been doing dope all night and my cigarette tastes so sweet and I want to sleep next to someone tonight, I miss it so badly... I've got bloodstains on my shirt and I'm gonna have bruises tomorrow but oh well (was it worth it?). Stop. You can't live in this little self-containment much longer. You're making yourself dull and depressed. 

Though right now inexplicably you're feeling pretty good. Remember rooftops with demons below toting flashlights, but they were only demons so continue mixing up the shots, there's nothing to worry about. Remember Oogle Tony's squat and running, hiding from some sadistic junkie-- a scene out of a movie, I swear to god-- my boyfriend picking up a metal rod in the dark and dusty room that we were hiding in, tiptoeing over to the door, me backed into a corner not breathing for fear it was the cops or the psycho who was going to kill us. Remember Sammy and his delusions and running through alleyways trying to get away from "Them". Remember Dana and my excursion off Capitol Hill to the Harley store and the knife store in the market, trying on leather jackets, high as a kite and so happy. 

Remembering Dizzy's popsicles and House's twizzlers and Skinny's jellybeans and Kristin's yellow robot and Stray's broken elbow dripping blood on the orange chair we found on the sidewalk. Remembering the couch in Neighbor's Alley and my boy and I sleeping on it in the dead of winter with nothing but each other to keep us warm. 

Remembering the Harvard House bathroom, where found warmth and shot dope in the middle of a blizzard. Remembering the Value Village dumpster and Burger King bathrooms and gravelly rooftops and the park and the basement in my old building. Remembering scams at Nordstroms and ounces of tar in diapers. Remembering Dizzy reading us to sleep and the Gutter Days and Callahan nodding on the carpet and Skinhead Pat drooling on himself and Robert's cynicism and obnoxious Gretchen and her ghetto cat and faggy Richard doing speed and eating M&amp;Ms in his apartment. Remembering Skinny tweaking on the bathroom floor and Skinhead Pat with a needle in his forehead. Remembering the Space Syringe. 

I miss you.  

TL;DR: Don't worry. I wouldn't have, either. 

EDIT: bonus pic of me in the Orange chair that stray bled on, eating one of Dizzy's Popsicles, with the cat Callahan on the floor. http://m.imgur.com/lkSTmkL, PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2vny9x/love_letter_to_seattle/

Spinning, spinning, not high enough, never high enough. Was I sick this morning, will I be sick tomorrow, am I hooked, will this incessant bullshit ever stop? Can I leave this place completely, will I leave this place complete? 

Escaping into my sister's arms with secrets I can't tell her. 

I cannot even comprehend it all, it's all a dream anyway, you'll wake up soon. You'll wake up soon. 

Last night I dreamed that Dizzy lured me behind Safeway to an airplane hangar and we were tossing a basketball back and forth and he somehow tricked me into coming closer to him so he could grab me and drag me somewhere with him and I screamed myself awake. First time I've ever done that before and I find myself upright on the couch, sweating, and Robert looks up at me from the needle in his arm and says, "bad dream?" 

I haven't had a nightmare in years.

TITLE: More writing from my old journals., POST BODY: 2008 

I'm biting back all the things I need to say and saying nothing instead. I am a coward and I will never feel better. What the fuck is the point of getting closer to someone if they only die or fuck you over? I don't have the energy for any of this anymore. I feel like nothing is real and I'm a fucking joke to everyone I see. I am a joke to myself, not worth the time it takes to look at me or say my name. This town is empty and I am empty in it. There is no escaping this. 

Life is one big joke and I don't care enough to wait for the punchline. I know it will be lame and worthless and lacking entirely in wisdom and honestly, who even gives a shit? 

I can't even deal with myself. I don't want to go home to a house that feels like nothingness so I'm sitting next to a building downtown by myself at 3 in the morning. I was in the park at first but the fucking sprinkler system came on and now my back is soaking wet and I have a headache. This is fucking stupid, all I want to do is lean up against someone, have someone to sleep next to and tell me it's okay. It's not okay. I am so fucking NOT okay. 

And no one gives a fuck and I'm getting eaten alive by Mosquitos and humans and there's nothing left. The sound of laughter makes me feel like annihilating myself and everyone in sight. My life is a broken sewer line. My mind has too much in it and none of it makes any difference. I cannot live like this, I cannot live like this, I am so tired of the same old shit every day and I can't even write about it, there's nothing to make sentences with, the words don't go together and I can't spell the letters and I have nothing to say. 

There must be something more somewhere. I've tasted it, I've lived it, loved it, lost it.

TITLE: More writing, this time from the very very first three weeks of doing dope every day., POST BODY: 2001

The past three weeks all I've known is dope, dope, dope. The entire contents of my head opened up before me, my memories spilled out like party favors and everyone grabbing at my words like vultures, to tear apart their meaning. And I close my eyes into a nod and everything is liquid comfort, and I need nothing--not even arms around me. Like this I can hold myself and no one is complaining. Like this no one is trading pain like baseball cards or wanting to burrow too far in. 

Fuck guilt. 

My eyes remain unfocused and I don't want to have to sit up straight or think. This is mental freedom (she says I was free before, I just couldn't see it and I stop and I blink and I feel so much better because I know she's right). 

I surrender all traces of control and place myself in the hands of heroin. And I finally know that I am not invincible, that no one is, that dope gets you in the end. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2we6yn/more_writing_this_time_from_the_very_very_first/

I sit in the fading sunlight 

Flipping through volumes of poetry, 

Trying to find a poem on leaving



Trying to find a poem on leaving 

My bruises and track marks behind me, 

Of finding myself on a desolate highway somewhere 

Where the moon and the stars are so close, 

So close and all I have to do 

Is throw back my head 

And laugh. 



Bruises on my arms and 

I wear short sleeves to remind myself 

I am no longer innocent 




And when I dream of leaving 

It is only a vision of of rising above

And beyond the remnants of 

Places I've been

Of things I've deserted

Of pieces I've lost and abandoned

And all the ashes of 

Six years of mistakes 

That still flow through my veins 

And carry me forward 

And back again. 



Always back again to

The bruises on my arms that

Reappear from time to time 

When I am bored 

Or lonely. 



It is an easy way to forget. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2we8fb/ode_to_bruises_2002/

TITLE: Loving and living, POST BODY: I am tiny, minuscule, just a small jumble of flesh and bones and one indescribable heart. I am a footnote, a sentence in parentheses, an item just barely remembered when it was almost too late. 

I have forgotten myself. 

I love too much. I give myself away and don't think twice. When I'm alone it's like I am vapor just barely hanging on to human form. When I'm alone, my heart skips beats; stasis is my form of living. 

Being alive..... What does that mean? It can't be breathing, blood pumping through veins, the heart doing its thing. My heart beats only in tandem. I breathe in plural. 

This isn't fun, it isn't fair, I didn't want this. My heart is trying to kill me-- going against my wishes just to prove that I am not, and never will be, in control. You inhabit my heart; no wonder you're unhappy-- trapped in some cold, unfamiliar prison that you can't even see. 

Wasted moments, days, years, eons spent not knowing what I could have had, and losing it. Breathing takes an effort that I don't think I have. 

And why is it that nothing can ever be just easy, good, or comfortable? Every situation comes with strings attached, a laundry list of bullshit to be dealt with and guilt to be endured. How have I survived this long? How did we get here, to this cold and empty place? I have forgotten where I came from. It has ceased to matter. 

All that matters is right now, I am sitting in my (empty) bed, waiting for the sun to rise and morning to begin, so that I can wait for the moon to rise, and then do it all again. 

My loneliness consumes me. I am no longer human. 

If I could raise the dead, I'd have an army by my side. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2x9o1y/loving_and_living/

TITLE: How i started doing dope..., POST BODY: I was 17. Senior year in high school, and I was psyched to graduate. I had plans to move out to San Francisco with my sister during the summer. Through a series of unfortunate events, I ended up not having enough credits to graduate, and then got kicked out of my school. Well, fuck em, I thought. I'll move to Cali anyway and finish high school there. 

Turns out that the school system differed dramatically and i ended up just dropping out of the school in Cali. Whatever, I didn't give a shit. I was working, living with my sis, having a grand old time. 

My best friend from growing up was out in Seattle, visiting her sister. She called me, saying "this town is awesome, you have to come up here." So I went up for the weekend and loved it so much that we decided to stay, try to find a place to live. 

We trekked all over Seattle, looking at neighborhoods, trying to find a place to rent. We ended up sitting down on the sidewalk on Capitol Hill with a local newspaper, looking at the classifieds. All of a sudden, these two homeless kids come up and drop something in my lap. "Merry Christmas," they say, and then sketched off down the sidewalk. 

I look down, and it's a little clear ziplock bag containing white powder. Okay, I think, free drugs! For just being young and cute and girls sitting on pavement!  

Jess and I end up looking at this apartment right down the street. The entire building is filled with gay couples, and the manager must have thought we were a couple because she immediately offers it to us with NO rental history at all. 

I go home for Christmas. When I get back, Jess asks me if I remember those kids with the free drugs. Of course I do! She tells me that she's letting them crash in our living room. Okay, I think... Whatever, I'm down for new experiences. 

Two people becomes three which becomes four, five six, seven, eight kids squatting in our place. And we find out they are junkies. That's okay, we are open minded. We keep a box of 200 needles in a TV stand. We make house rules, like no locking the bathroom when you shoot up because it's scary to have to break in when we think youre dead. 

We have a dealer routinely coming by to bag his shit out. One day we decide that heroin looks fun (I'd been doing drugs for years, but never dope) and we notice that Dana usually drops shit on the carpet while bagging it up. So we pick it out of the carpet and proceed to mix it up, having observed this countless times in the past. 

Fuck. I get it now. It's all over after that. I snorted monkey water for a week before having my ex shoot me up. A month or so later we get evicted and I learn just how fucking awesome living on the street actually is. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2xmlsg/how_i_started_doing_dope/

TITLE: Johnny., POST BODY: So. Johnny was the most absolutely beautiful person that I have ever known. I was so in love with this guy, I can't even describe it. I met him in Seattle in 2000, but moved away for about a year. I ended up going back there, where I rekindled our friendship. 

He was a homeless junkie; I was living out of a car with a friend of mine. He and I ended up hooking up and everything was perfect.... Until one of our good good friends was beaten to death, and two days later another good friend died of an overdose after being clean for two months. 

I bolted. I couldn't deal, I was too young and shit was too intense, so I ran to my sister in San Francisco. 

I got there, and all I could think about was Johnny. I realized that nothing made any sense unless I was with him, so I borrowed money to go back to Seattle to be with him. 

Shit was great. Shit sucked. We were living underneath a bridge and strung out as fuck, panhandling every day. But it was okay, because we had each other. 

My family offered to bring me home, and I refused to go.... Unless they would let him come with me. They agreed, and we went back east to kick. 

hah. You can't fucking escape, ever. We ended up finding connects on the east coast and were as strung out as ever. We would make a trip out of state a few times a month to get cheaper dope... One day I picked him up at work, ready to make the trip, but we wanted to get something first for the drive down. 

He overdosed. In the middle of nowhere, in our car, and it took me 20 minutes to make it to a place that had a pay phone so I could call an ambulance. It was way too late, and he was gone. At the hospital, they let me into the room for about two seconds to say goodbye to him, and the cops were standing there flexing their dicks the entire time. 

I don't remember much after that. 

All I know is.... I loved this man. More than myself, more than my family, more than anything. And I still do. 

This was 12 years ago this Friday. 3/13/03. I can't fucking forget it, and I just wanted someone besides me to feel it. 

I fucking love you all. Please be careful, and I'm sorry for the shitty writing. If you guys could think of him on Friday, I'd really appreciate it. He was the most gentle soul you could ever hope to meet.

TITLE: I got dope today for the first time since June!, POST BODY: WARNING: long, boring story. 

I just wanted to share because I'm so happy about it and I have no one else to talk to about these things. 

Today started out badly. It's the anniversary of my fiance's death and I usually have a hard time dealing with it. I was invited to go hang out with someone who offered to get me high for free, since I have absolutely zero dollars. I don't have a car of my own but was going to borrow one for the day. This friend lives 3 hours away from me but I was going to go because I wanted to see him and I thought it would tAke my mind off things. Unfortunately, my mother (owner of the car) had to schedule an emergency doctors appointment and the only time they could fit her in was smack in the middle of the day. She got back too late for me to be able to make the 6 hour round trip and have the car back by the evening when she needed it again. 

So she got back and saw me moping around and felt bad about screwing up my day, so she gave me some money and told me to go do something fun. I don't actually have any connects now, since I live in a tiny tiny town where I hardly know anyone, and my old connect from before I moved is now clean. But I DO have the phone number of someone I haven't met yet but who I've texted back and forth with. He tells me he's picking up soon and is fine with me only buying one bag, which is all I had the money for. 

He's an hour away so by the time I get to town he is already on his way to his d-boys house. It was perfect timing and I didn't have to wait long for him. He gets into my car and I apologize for only getting one, and told him the situation with the anniversary and stuff, hoping that he'll understand that normally I wouldn't ask him to go out of his way for practically no reward. 

So he gave me an extra bag. Which was super super duper fucking awesome. Especially because shit like that very rarely happens to me and I didn't even know this guy. And I have zero tolerance right now, too, so I'm saving the second one for tomorrow. It's been 8 months since I did dope, and I had some hydros in August and some PST in December, and I've been fiending this whole time. 

So today worked out well in the end and I'm actually content right now for the first time in a long time. That's all I wanted to say. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/2yzi71/i_got_dope_today_for_the_first_time_since_june/

TITLE: Yet another overdose., POST BODY: I saw an old friend of mine today who sold me a bag for about half price for "old times sake." I was obviously psyched because I can very rarely get high. I didn't do a test shot because it was a pretty small bag, although I considered saving 2/3rds of it for later but I didn't because like I said, it was small. 

Well, I ended up falling out in his house. So they had to narcan me. I woke up on the floor with 5 strangers plus my friend all staring down at me. I felt like such an idiot and I'm pissed that I didn't save some of the bag because obviously it would have been enough for another shot later tonight. 

Here's the thing, though. I'm really glad that I didn't die in my friends house because that would have been fucking awful for him. But I've been incredibly depressed and suicidal for a few years now and part of me is disappointed that they brought me back. I sort of wish they hadn't. I would probably never *intentionally* kill myself, but I wish I could make some sort of "do not resuscitate" order for situations like today, with a waiver for whoever is with me so they won't get in trouble if I die in their house. 

So, I'm still alive and no longer high and I wasted a good opportunity and the last of my money. 

Sorry for the morbidity. It just drove home for me how utterly fucking hopeless I feel. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/32qjhx/yet_another_overdose/

Recently I started going to a new psychiatrist with the hopes of getting back on meds but that hasn't happened yet due to other things going on that I don't want to get into. Every time I think that things can't get any worse mentally and emotionally, I learn that there is no "bottom" to rock bottom.

The depression has only gotten worse for me. I think for a lot of people, it does end up getting better the longer they stay clean. I guess it depends on underlying issues.

BODY: I meant that some people say that they start feeling less depressed the longer they are off opiates, which makes me think that for them, they were depressed because of their habits and lifestyle, and not necessarily because they were depressed to begin with. So like a situational depression instead of a chronic depression. 

I am definitely chronically depressed, and have been since way before I started doing opiates. In my case (and I think this is pretty common) opiates made me much less depressed. Now when I am off of them, there's nothing to distract myself from it and it just gets worse. There's no relief. 

I'm sorry, this makes almost no sense. It's been a long day and my brain isn't working.

BODY: I don't think you should allow her to drink at a party, but I think your opinion on her having a small glass of wine at home with you is fine. It's not necessarily that you don't trust her, but if she is drinking at a party with other kids her age there will be much more peer pressure or sketchy situations. My parents were fine with me drinking with my friends at home, but didn't want me drinking when I was out. (I don't recommend allowing her to get drunk though,and I especially dint think you should allow her friends to drink at your house.... I'm just giving an example from my own life.) 

As far as letting her see her street family, this is a slippery slope but I would say you maybe should. I've been homeless before and one of the hardest things to do is leave that "family" and not be able to see them. Especially since not one of her new peers will be able to understand her like her "family" does. For a 16 year old in a new foster placement, that feeling of being an outsider could be really detrimental to her growth. 

Although if you do allow her to go, I'd put a time limit on it and maybe be sure to hang around, maybe in a coffee shop nearby, just in case things get uncomfortable for her.

BODY: I would give her the benefit of the doubt for as long as she isn't giving you any reasons to suspect her. If you respect her and trust her, you will earn her trust and respect in turn and that will make her less likely to relapse. 

Offer her counseling but make it clear that she doesn't have to go... But emphasize how hard it is to make as big a change in her life as she has made, and make sure she knows that anything she tells the counselor is confidential. You can get her a counselor that understands teenage homelessness. There are homeless youth organizations that have caseworkers who work specifically with homeless or previously homeless or foster youth.

BODY: Speaking from experience, I think it might be good to allow her to see her family. It may also put things in perspective for her and reinforce her decision to stay clean. I also lurked your user history so I could see what other parents were advising and I have to say that I disagree with "catloving." A lot. That advice is tailor made to make your daughter distrust you and possibly rebel. I think you should trust your instincts with this girl. It sounds like she's doing everything right and the most important thing is that she is incredibly motivated and it comes from an internal source, which makes it much more powerful. 

Although I do think you might benefit from reading books on youth addiction, just for another perspective. And I really would encourage her to voluntarily do counseling. Homelessness is very traumatic, especially for someone her age.

I ended up taking a 50mg naltrexone about 24 hours after doing dope. Half an hour later I started feeling really weird... flushed yet clammy skin with those weird crawling pin pricks... sweaty and cold. I freaked out thinking I was in for bad pwds, but I ended up taking some otc sleeping pills and when I woke up 3 hours later the feeling was mostly gone. So I guess that feeling was just the lingering heroin leaving my body, or psychosomatic manifestations are very real.

I've been a junkie for 15 years with minimal negative physical symptoms, and alcohol has completely shredded my liver in the past few years. Plus, alcohol withdrawal can kill you. It's more socially acceptable but is way worse for you than heroin.

BODY: If you've never had a habit before, it can take up to 2 weeks to a month of DAILY use to get withdrawal symptoms. 

That being said, I don't recommend going that long. I don't even recommend going more than two days in a row because the mental dependence can set in fast.

TITLE: Rough outline of a wasted life., POST BODY: I am trying to find a way to open up, and get things out of my head, and deal with the issues that I have. I have never been able to talk about any of this with anyone, and I am having a hard time finding words and giving myself permission to let my guard down. I have deleted several paragraphs already, re-reading them and thinking “there is no way anyone will believe this,” or, “I can’t say that, it will only hurt whoever’s reading this.” And that is my first inclination: to protect myself and others, from myself. 

I am chronically depressed. I have a chronic heroin addiction. I am chronically incapable of telling anyone about what really happens in my head, and so I have stayed chronically mentally unwell. I have hidden myself so well and for so long that the truth feels overly dramatic and self-serving and completely unbelievable. But I have this funny feeling that something is going to happen soon and I am going to die, and I am at peace with that, and there are those who need to understand why. 

All of the darkness has stayed inside of me and there isn’t any room left. I don’t know where it came from. I sometimes feel that I can’t find even one memory that isn’t tinged with loneliness, or fear, or shadows. All of them whirling inside of me and turning into hate, and loathing, and anger—towards myself. I was—I am—so afraid of what might happen if I lose control, if I am no longer able to contain it, to internalize it, to hold it in. Terrified of giving in to my compulsions of self-harm. I am my own worst enemy, and half of me battles the other, and I am in the middle, and I am not winning this war. 

I can remember feeling this when I was less than 10 years old. 

And now, years later, I am still lonely and afraid and I have no self-esteem and I alternate between intense feelings of self-loathing, and self-pity. There is screaming in my head and sometimes the need to hurt myself is so intense that I can barely keep myself from giving in. I have visions of my body bashing itself in and shredding its own skin, and I am only partly horrified.

Drugs, for me, have been the only source of comfort, and they will most likely kill me. I can barely drag myself out of bed in the morning, or afternoon, or sometimes evening, if I am sober. I have nothing to look forward to but pain and misery (and yes, I know this sounds melodramatic and ridiculous). I literally cannot leave the house unless I have to, because I’m so anxious and depressed. I am in such a deep, dark hole and I do not have the skills or motivation to do anything about it. So why not get high? Why not get drunk? Why not stay up all night shooting heroin, always half a grain away from an OD? I have lost the energy to give a shit. What a waste of intelligence, of strength, of heart. I could have been a great addition to the world. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/33rjqf/rough_outline_of_a_wasted_life/

They won't give you subs or anything but they do give Valium and comfort meds. It's on the corner of Pearl and North Winooski avenue, across from Three Needs. 

Are you 21 or under? Or can you PASS for 21? If so, try Spectrum, which is right next to Three Needs on Pearl. They have a drop in center and have lunch and clothes and space to chill.

BODY: There are a lot of people coming from out of state to deal. But the problem is that most of the state is rural. There are really only 3 towns that have a good amount of dealers, and even then you have to know someone and can't cold cop. 

The deal with the "epidemic" is that Vermont isn't seen as a drug state so the amount of addicts here seems really overwhelming. And for a small state, it is. The governor has been very proactive with treatment options, which is awesome. But I think a lot of it has to do with us being a very small state with a small population and like no urban settings, where you might expect drug activity.

TITLE: I need advice..., POST BODY: This isn't a huge deal but it's bothering me and i wanted to run the situation by you guys. 

I only had one dealer that i go to, and he's awesome. Originally he was just middling, but a few weeks ago he started to sell instead. He's almost always around and an actual genuinely awesome guy, and i never have to wait for him. He's perfect. 

And here's an example of that: i called him the other day because my friend needed 3 bundles. Dboy said he was out of town until the next day, but he said he could maybe call someone and see if they could meet me instead, because Dboy knows that my friend Tim who i middle for has another source he will go to if i can't help him, which means that i wouldn't be able to get high. So Dboy was looking out for me in a major way by offering this. 

So the guy he called is, i *think*, the guy that Dboy gets his stuff from. He said that "mark" was willing to meet up with me, but it was only a one-time thing, just because Dboy was out of town. I told Dboy that i had no problem with that and that I'd rather just deal with him because i don't know this other guy, and I'm an unarmed girl so I'd rather go with the person I'm more familiar with. 

So i met up with Mark's runner and all was good. Then the next day, Mark texted me to tell me that he was around. And then he did again today. I asked Tim, the guy i middle for, if he needed anything and he did, so i decided to see if i could get a better price from Mark. It ended up being about $20 cheaper, but I'm pretty sure i can get a better deal because he basically asked me how much money i had and i stupidly named an amount only a bit cheaper. I'm thinking that if i decide to keep going through him, I'll ask for a much better price. So i ended up going through him. 

But now my conscience is bothering me. Dboy clearly said that it was a one-time thing, which obviously is only because he makes money off me. His source, Mark, doesn't care and is willing to continue meeting me. I *really* don't want to fuck Dboy over but cheaper is better. I talked to my friend and he is willing to alternate going through Dboy and Mark, even though he'd be paying a bit more with Dboy. But I'm worried that Mark will tell Dboy that he's seen me again, and Dboy will get pissed and stop dealing with me and possibly ask Mark to stop, too. I don't want to lose either one of them because they are both really professional and fast and i also don't know anyone else. 

**So, my questions.** I'm going to go through Dboy tomorrow and I'm wondering if i should tell him that his source called me and offered to deal with me? Just to be up-front and to let Dboy know that I'm not trying to cut him out? Or should i just not say anything? I really don't want to get cut off but it's fucking nice to have another option. I know this doesn't really sound like a big deal but i feel bad for going around Dboy and I'm worried about being cut off. **I'm worried that if I don't tell Dboy that Mark called and he finds out, that  it will ruin my relationship with him. But also worried that if I DO tell him, he'll ask Mark to stop dealing me and I'll lose another connect. It's always good to have more than one option.**

Sorry, this is long and rambley and I'm high as shit so it probably doesn't make sense. I commend you for reading this far. 

Thanks, guys. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3fgbut/i_need_advice/

Little Man was his name. His mother used to shoot him up with heroin when he was a kid, and make him go cop for her. She died and he ran away. He was, like, our child. We took care of him, made sure he was fed, and kept him from setting himself on fire every night (this was a weird habit of his). He had the compartment in our squat next to ours, and i could hear his lighter flicking at night and smell the lighter fluid, and i'd always go sit with him until he calmed down. 

I don't know what happened to him. I hope he's okay but i don't remember his real name.

TITLE: Reminder to everyone about general civility., POST BODY: So, as junkies, we have all experienced being ostracized by others. This little corner of reddit, where so many of us feel at home in a way that we don't in the real world, should not be ostracizing us further. As such, the mods ask that everyone remain civil with each other. No one should have to deal with personal attacks or homophobic slurs or racism. And any trolling behavior, including but not limited to encouraging people to die or being gleeful at someone's loss, will result in a ban. 

C'mon, guys. We are all in the same boat. Let's not make things harder than they already are. 

Oh, and there's a new bullet in the sidebar. 

I truly love this sub. I hope everyone can do their part to keep it safe and loving.

TITLE: This is definitely NOT your usual PST question., POST BODY: So the past two days I've been drinking PST. Yesterday i randomly had my back kind of cramp/seize up around the lower right hand side, to the point where i can't straighten it out. If i try to straighten it, my torso sort of involuntarily twists down and to the left. I can't really walk upright- i am walking like a little old lady who looks like she needs a cane, all hunched over with shaky steps. The muscles in my arms and legs feel really tight, too. But they aren't cramping like that.

The only reason i asked if it could be one of the alkaloids is because i haven't been doing anything else that's abnormal that would possibly injure me. No manual labor, exercise, vigorous sex :(. 

Does anyone have any ideas about this? Or any ideas about what else it could possibly be? I can barely even walk up the stairs... I've been crawling up them.

TITLE: Nucynta vs. Other opiates for chronic pain, POST BODY: My grandmother is a chronic pain patient. My mother always comes to me for advice about her meds because she knows i am a junkie. Well, a few years ago, my grandma was swi tched from norco to nucynta because she was taking too many of the norcos and "getting loopy." Since then she has bought a timed pill dispenser that only opens when it's time for her dose, and is in a shitload of pain, and what I'm wondering is-- how effective is nucynta in comparison with hydros or norco?

TITLE: I might possibly be getting my old job back..., POST BODY: So i used to work for this social service agency. First in their family shelter, and then in their individual adult shelter. I hated the agency but loved the work. And they just recently opened up what they call a "warming shelter," which is basically a shelter for single adults and they are allowed to be under the influence while there. The other shelters in my area will breathalyze or kick people out for being fucked up, but in this one, it's allowed as long as people can still walk and function. 

Anyway. My ex still works there and has been telling me stories. They just opened, so it's really new, and they are feeling things out. But i guess he works with a bunch of really green, clueless "do-gooder" types who have caused a bunch of problems with the clients because they don't know how to handle shit. So while on the phone the other night he was like, "man, i fucking wish you still worked here. We need you." 

And i miss it. I love that work and it's the only thing I'm good at, and i am DAMN good at it. So the ex contacted the boss, and the boss said, "have her call me ASAP about a job." 

So. He is on vacation until tuesday, but I'm hoping he will take me back. The only problem is that the ex has told him of my substance abuse issues so i have to bullshit my way through that, which is fine, i can do that. And in my line of work, SA issues can be a bonus, not a drawback. 

And also, to make this relevant... The ex told me that he accidentally caught someone shooting up in the bathroom and had to kick him out. My first thought? "I wonder who his connect is and how much he pays." 

My second thought was "Fuck, if i start working there again, i won't be able to hit the needle exchange anymore." , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/3y2768/i_might_possibly_be_getting_my_old_job_back/

So i pass the beer store and go to the liquor store instead, get my bottle of rot-gut, pay for it with the last of my money, and as I'm walking out the door i happen to look down and i see a motherfucking $100 bill just laying on the ground, begging me to pick it up! 

Which i promptly did and then hightailed it outta there so fast that it looked like i robbed the place. And then promptly called my dealer, who of fucking course has not answered yet.

Yes. Although don't throw them away- trade them for weed instead. Psychological addiction sneaks up on you really quickly and often without you realizing it until it's too late to stop it. This is not a path that anyone should go down.

I don't find that funny in the least. That isn't what I meant when I made that comment. What I meant was that I thought it was funny that one of the more downvoted comments on this sub is one that doesn't have anything offensive or mean or insulting in it. It's just me being a bit too vigilant--I admit that-- but it prompted this huge response that seemed way out of proportion to the actual comment. 

And I'm not trying to "justify" anything. I explained my reasoning behind requesting that the sentence be removed. Everyone who replied to that request explained their reasoning as to why it wasn't sourcing, and I just did the same.

&gt;As much as anything, it's a question of relative morality. What of the tens of thousands of sick and suffering chemically addicted Americans, barbarically imprisoned for the crime of their illness? Locked down in facilities where unspeakable acts of dehumanization and violence are inescapable, and murder a looming threat. Are we saying that what's systemic in our culture, and out of our direct hands and view, shares no moral equivalency to those abominations that may rival narco assassinations in Juarez? Or, is that a distinction for the passive self-righteous?

BODY: You will most likely have some minor withdrawals but i doubt they will be that bad after just two weeks. Grab some lope and take it for 3 or 4 days and you should be good to go. 

And just so you know, for next time... Once you've had a habit, you get strung out much faster. I start getting sick now after using 3 days in a row, but when i first started it took me about 3 weeks of daily IV use to get sick. Also, the more times you go through withdrawals, the worse they get.

Second, they see so many people with legit scripts that they won't even bat an eye. 

Your addiction shouldn't keep you from seeing a doctor if you need to. No need to say you're an addict unless that's critical to what care you need, like if you might have endocarditis it helps that the doc knows you shoot up, etc.

And there was a trick to finding the vein, like put your finger on it and where you feel the pulse you hit to (x) side of it- i don't remember exactly, I'm sorry. Like i said, it's been a while. I now have a juicy vein on the back of my elbow that i use.

BODY: Thanks, OP. /u/KickerS12X can you add this to the megathread (even though it may not be fent- still counts as "dangerous dope").

To answer your question, before bags were cut with fent it was common for junkies to search out batches that others overdosed on. But nowadays, after people started using fent, we are less likely to want to find these bags because not only is there increased risk, but fent doesn't even keep you well as long at all. So it's a lose lose situation.

TITLE: I had crazy dope dreams last night., POST BODY: I only use occasionally anymore, just out of necessity. I haven't been physically strung out in about a year and a half, but last night i had crazy fucking dope dreams for the first time in a while. 
My friend and i were hanging out and she had had left to go do something. I looked over and there was a bundle and a half of ECP and 2 grams of tar, plus a paper fold with maybe 3 points raw on it. I knew i had these wicked ridiculous huge long needles in my bag but i couldn't escape my boyfriend (I'm single but in my dream i had a boyfriend who i had to sneak around on) in order to go shoot up in the bathroom. 

So i decided to stash the drugs until i could use them. So i emptied the fold into the cooker and put it on my bedside table, and slid the bundles under a loose floorboard (?) but i left the tar on the bed. So I'm laying on the bed and my nonexistent boyfriend comes in saying "what is this?" and I'm freaking out trying to scrape the melted tar out of the sheets, which is impossible. 

So i go to grab the cooker with the raw in it to take to the bathroom and my friend comes in and sees me with something in my hand, and starts giving me shit, saying "what's in your hand, you're getting high, aren't you?" and I'm trying to get away but she's grabbing at me and the cooker spills. 

So she runs off to get my sister to tell on me and i remember the rest of the bags under the floorboard. I grab those and my rigs and slam into the bathroom and lock the door. I mix that shit up real quick and am trying to hit but now my sister is at the door and breaking it down before i can hit, and all the bags are out and my needle is there and she confiscates everything and i wake up. 

Fuck. Dope. Dreams. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/41rxwn/i_had_crazy_dope_dreams_last_night/

BODY: Years ago i had no experience except real life experience and they advertised substitute positions, no training necessary. I applied and was honest about having been homeless and having had an addiction in the past and they trained me. It was basically just filling in for full time staff when they were out, but then a fulltime position opened and i was hired for that, and after that i bounced around to a few different agencies. I had to work my way up from the bottom, but it is doable if you can prove yourself. I still don't have a degree but i have a great resume.

If you're interested in something like that, the best way in- if you don't have a degree- is to apply for a per-diem/substitute position. They cover shifts for regular staff who are sick or on vacation, and you don't always have to have prior experience. You can also pretty much make your own schedule and pick and choose what shifts you want, and work as much (depending on availability) or as little as possible. It'll also give you a great sense of whether or not it's something you want to do. 

You should go for it!

BODY: Yeah, it sucks, but it won't be for much longer. The only reason I'm there is because i was supposed to move out of state and there was a month between when my lease ended and when i was supposed to go. So i stayed with them, and then of course shit happened and i couldn't end up going, but i had already given up my place and now was stuck there.

BODY: (I was pretty high at the time, so, no...)

Not really though. I've worked at other shelters and have been sober-ish for about half of the time, and i was never triggered by it. I think mainly because it's like a puzzle to solve- how to get this person away from other clients so THEY aren't triggered, how to keep an eye on them to make sure they are ok... At that point I'm not even thinking about myself, I'm thinking about how to keep the rest of the shelter safe around it. Its not about the drugs at that point. It's about safety protocols. 

But again, i had done a shot before work and I'm not actively addicted right now either.

Refer them to the local exchange. Make sure they have narcan and clean needles if possible. Offer your ear- free of judgement- if they do want to kick. 

It would be helpful to know your policy. Will they lose their bed if they go to rehab? If so, rethink that policy.

You will be very, very, very missed., POST BODY: we have been contacted by friends and family of someone who believed that one of our mods, /u/yeaheroin,  is their loved one that recently passed away. While we cannot 100% confirm this is true because of the anonymous nature of reddit, we have evidence to support that it is him.

/u/yeaheroin was a long-time member of this sub. He cared a lot about this place and about its members. He was very knowledgeable and always ready with a joke. He will be missed.

BODY: Very good. I went from having no drugs or money to a friend calling me out of the blue and offering me morphine. I told him i was broke until Wednesday but he was just like, pay me then. I didn't even ask for the front. i don't like morphine much but definitely better than nothing, and they were the non-gel kind. 

Then a couple friends lent me money so i can buy cigarettes and food between now and Wednesday when i get paid. I had no idea what i was going to do and they saved my ass big-time. 

So it's been a really good night and i expected it to suck when i woke up this morning.

BODY: Do you also shoot dope and/or pills? Because the breathing thing reminds me of my recent hospital stay. 


&gt; So it's being called "heroin-induced  non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema," which basically means this:

&gt;&gt;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE), which affects 0.3-2.4% of heroin overdoses, generally lasts 24-48 hours and responds to supportive care. In most instances, hypoxia improves with mask oxygen ventilation only, but noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and endotracheal intubation may be required. Endotracheal intubation is indicated for airway protection, severe hypoxia, acidosis, and cardiovascular ininstability


&gt;Except that i didn't overdose, at least i didn't need narcan. 


&gt;So i went to work as usual Thursday 11:45pm. Already feeling like shit and having trouble breathing. I thought i was just over tired, or still getting over pneumonia. 


&gt;I got to work, and hung in until around 2am Friday, so a little over two hours. At that point, i could barely breath and walk at the same time. I told my co-workers that i couldn't breath, pneumonia etc etc, they let me go. I live an hour away and no way was i driving an hour with my vision flickering like that, But my old roommate isn't answering and its literally -5 degrees. 


&gt;I don't want some gas station owner calling the cops on me so i park behind the gas station and tell him my story and he agrees to not call the cops when he sees me parked there over his shift.


&gt;I left the car running for the entire 4 hours that it took for me to feel able to make it home. At which point i fall into bed and when i wake up again i get a ride to the hospital. 


&gt;It hurt so much to breath, and i was panicking so much, that they gave me IV ketamine (oooh, so nice at such small doses!) and IV ativan. 


&gt;And then they had to intubate because i was not getting enough oxygen, so more ativan and more fentanyl. 

&gt;And thank god the fucking tube is out now. I can sit up and move to the chair  but am still on oxygen, in the ICU, and on a liquid diet.

I would say let your body get used to not really feeling withdrawals from the lower dose and then start tapering further. but, again, I've never tapered.

BODY: First of all, I am glad that you and your friend are alright (relatively speaking, I guess). But you didn't die. If you had died, we would not be reading this post right now, because you would be dead. 

Second of all, you are coughing up blood and it hurts to breathe? You should REALLY get that checked out and be sure to tell the doctor that you recently overdosed. The trouble breathing is because your lungs filled up with fluid after overdosing-- it's called "heroin-induced non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema," and it's what I had a few weeks ago when I was in the ICU for 4 days. My other diagnoses were "acute respiratory failure" and "severe sepsis," so you may want to think about getting yourself back to the hospital ASAP. Like, NOW. 

The coughing up blood thing may be because your lungs are all raw now... I'm not really sure about that one, but everything else sounds exactly like what I had, and that was scary as shit. My lungs basically said "fuck you, i'm not going to work anymore" and my blood oxygen levels were scary low. Don't wait. Go get checked out.

I disagree with this. Many ODs are a direct result of either fentanyl laced dope or differing potency of the same stamps or batch.

TITLE: ATTN: answers about the problems with the comments, POST BODY: 
Currently reddit is having a glitch where not all comments are showing up. Seems to be happening on multiple subs.

There seem to be a few other symptoms as well. Mail responses seem to be working though.

So patience everyone - your comments are not being deleted, nor are you shadow-banned. Perhaps there was a bad software update. I am sure they are working on it.

Please do not mod mail us over this, as it is happening all across Reddit. I will remove this sticky when things return back to normal.

BODY: I can't see a doctor putting a person on subs when they  have already stopped using and are not in withdrawal. 

But if that's how you want too play it, 3 to 5 days is pretty normal. I'd go a full week though if you want to be really careful.

BODY:  I can't help you with the list because I know nothing about the different research chemicals that a lot of people are using now. 

But I just wanted to say that the effort you've put into this project/program/job is really incredible, and I wish that everyone who works in your field could be as dedicated. 

One of the (many) reasons why I love this sub so much, and why I am so protective of it, is that people such as yourself and our resident cop, /u/oh_no_five_oh, can come here and learn from us and hopefully break down some of the misconceptions and prejudices that society often has about us. And vice versa. 

So, thanks again, on behalf of junkies everywhere.

I can't *imagine* why anyone would not want you around them anymore.

BODY: Yeah, it seems like an excessively harsh rule for huge cities, but then the mods would need to figure out what size city is okay, and then still monitor the thread in case people narrow location down to neighborhoods or streets or buildings where they cop. It's just not worth the risk that the admins would see it, determine that we were using this sub to buy or sell drugs, and then banning the subreddit because of it. We have been warned by them before, which is why we are so strict about the location and sourcing rule.

I don't know what your problem is... Is it because we didn't choose you under your real username? If that's the case, no wonder we didn't if this comment is any indication of your personality. 
I've also noticed that pretty much the instant someone becomes a mod, they start getting SO much hate. And yet the same people who give us shit will see a sourcing post and cry for the mods to come take care of it. 

I wonder what you all would do if every one of the mods took a couple days off modding. Maybe we'd get a bit of appreciation then. 

That being said, if you have actual suggestions for us on how you think we should handle this sub, feel free to list them if you think you can do so as an adult and not a whiny little kid hiding behind an alt.

BODY: Tell him, for a couple of reasons. One is that there should be openness and honestly in a relationship. Obviously this is really really hard to do because we're junkies, and too used to lying about things and hiding our lifestyles as a form of self-preservation, so changing our ingrained behavior is really hard to do. 

The second reason why i think you should come clean to him is more of a self-serving reason: you are going to be continuously  looking over your shoulder with him and paranoid and wracked with guilt about it, just wondering when the other shoe will drop and what will happen when it does. If you tell him, you get to skip that part and get straight to the consequences. 

I wish you luck. And like another person said, let us know what happens!

TITLE: I fucked up really badly today., POST BODY: I haven't gotten high in about 2 weeks and was fiending pretty hard. I also am completely broke because I have no idea where my paycheck is- it was supposed to be mailed but it's been missing. I was freaking out because I can't survive another two weeks with 50 cents in my pocket. A really good friend offered to western union me enough money to make it until I can get my check, even helped me to figure out a plan for making last. We budgeted a certain amount for food, gas, cigarettes, beer, and with enough left that I could get high once today. 

So I was psyched and the first thing I did was go see my dealer. My friend and I have this deal where we'll do the first shot of a new batch while on the phone together, just in case something happens (I haven't gotten around to giving him an emergency contact for me though. So if something does happen there is nothing he could do about it). 

Anyway, I was parked in a church parking lot on the phone with him, doing my shot, when all of a sudden apparently I stop responding to him. So naturally he freaks out, knowing that I had just fallen out and he couldn't do anything about it. 

I woke up 2 hours later with something like 15 missed calls and messages. I called back and was told what happened. I didn't even remember that I hadn't gotten off the phone with him, I thought I had just nodded off after hanging up. 

So obviously I'm feeling really guilty and horrible, he felt like it was his fault for loaning me the money, and just putting him through that made me feel even worse. But I assured him I was fine and that I was going to drive home and call him when I got there to tell him I was okay. 

I set off on my hour long drive home and decide that I'm still not okay to be driving, so I pulled over to the side of someone's driveway to wait a little bit. But the next thing I know, it's an hour later and there is a cop opening my door and shaking me and yelling in my ear to wake me up. Apparently, the woman who lived there saw me passed out, couldn't wake me up, so called the cops to come check on me. 

I got away with telling him that I had a migraine and pulled over to try to nap it off. He believed me but has to call the paramedics to come check,me out to see if I needed medical attention. I refused to go in the ambulance and got away with them not finding out I was on dope. 

By this time, I was supposed to be home like 3 hours ago with the car that I had borrowed. My family was super pissed at me and my friend was also worried again when he kept calling with me not answering because I was out once again and it was an hour past when I said I'd be home. So he obviously thinks I'm dead, once again. 

So that was an interesting day that was full of me scaring the living shit out of my closest friend and making him think that it was his fault to loaning me the money. I feel so guilty about that. 

I had forgotten that I had taken a bunch of xanax earlier that morning and all through last night. So don't mix, guys. 

I don't know why I'm making this post. It isn't an interesting story at all, but I feel fucking horribly about how badly I scared my friend and I needed to write it,out and tell someone, to get it out of my head. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4g6x66/i_fucked_up_really_badly_today/

I do it as a favor to the person as much as just for a little treat for myself. I never make much- a bag or 2 depending on what they get. I don't make a living off of it and honestly, with how far I have to go and the risk I'm taking, I should charge a hell of a lot more. But I don't, because I'm not "scum." 

There ARE a lot of shady middles who depend on fleecing their custies in order to stay well. I am not one of them and I don't middle to feed my habit.

Find a therapist. Maybe do outpatient treatment to have some accountability?

/u/psycho_knot: you have no control over his actions. Its not your fault that he's suicidal and it won't be your fault if he goes through with it. He is trying to get you back by guilt-tripping you and that is an emotionally abusive act. You need to focus on yourself right now. 

That's not to say that you should do nothing, though.

BODY: &gt;Can you guys not give me bs posts about how I shouldn't try it and ruin my life? I'm willing to take that risk but I honestly have self control with every drug i've tried (there's been a lot)

I don't think that people realize that heroin and opiates in general are a whole different ballgame. Maybe you are able to exercise restraint and self control with other drugs, but all that flies out the window when it comes to dope. Opiates get inside your head and borrow there. They fester and gnaw at you until they are all that you can think about. 

We have people coming here all the time swearing that they are only going to try dope, and thy are only going to do it as a special thing once in a while. They promise us that they don't have an addictive personality, that they have a lot of self control, that they are the one special person who has the willpower to not become addicted. And then a few months later, or maybe a year, they are back here saying "I should have listened" and telling us how they overdosed and are now living in their car after having lost everything. 

You said that you are willing to take the risk of ruining your life... May I ask why you are so willing to throw yourself away?

BODY: I think that once a week is way too often. I would say once every couple months. That way it really is just using as a special occasion and a treat. Once a week just seems more habitual and would kind of normalize the use, which is how people get sucked in to their first habit. I think The danger comes when using it becomes part of someone's routine.

BODY: So you do or you don't have self-control when it comes to drugs? You claimed to in your post but then go on to say that you went on a 6 day meth run and basically only stopped because your body forced you to. Then you say that you had an addiction to kratom. Nothing that you said points towards you being in control of your drug use. You also asked if you should try heroin-I answered that for you but you just don't like my answer. 

This IS a harm reduction sub, which is why we are telling you not to do heroin. If you're going to do it anyway, start out snorting maybe a quarter of a point just to see how it affects you. Wait 20 to 30 minutes and adjust your dose if necessary. Get ahold of som narcan and do NOT use alone. Make sure that there is someone sober and trustworthy with you. 

But, man, this isn't going to be an occasional thing for you. I can promise you that. From everything you said in your post I know you won't be able to stay away from it. It might take a month, it might take a year, but you WILL become addicted to it. Your past history with meth and kratom pretty much guarantees that.

TITLE: Long Island fentanyl warning., POST BODY: I received this PM on Friday:

&gt;"Just got fent twice in a row. One was an unmarked bag in NYC, other was **red stamped Grey Goose with a goose on it.** 

&gt;it was two different batches, two different dealers, two different stamps. And I'm 99% sure it's fentanyl... It's white as snow, dissolved immediately, and 1/3 of a bag almost knocked out my 250 pound, usually 3 bags per shot to get nice boyfriend."

Stay safe out there, everyone. 

Also, in case you didn't know, there is a **[fentanyl warnings section in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/index#wiki_fentanyl_warnings).** It is updated every time someone posts a warning here. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4mu69y/long_island_fentanyl_warning/

BODY: I actually liked living in my car, for some of the time at least. 

But I was actually talking about something that happened recently with a couple who are members here. One was an addict and he got his boyfriend into it, and they went on and on about how he wasn't going to do t often and there's no way the boyfriend would let him get addicted and he didn't have an addictive personality and blah  blah blah and two months later he overdosed, one of them lost his job, they were kicked out of where they were staying and we're living in their car. 

Prime example.

BODY: No. If you're on methadone you will have to take it every day. 

I guess if you really wanted to you could get on suboxone and just never take it except for when you have to test dirty for it, but I never got high off of suboxone. 

I'm not really sure what you're asking... You want to be prescribed something that you can use occasionally to get high off of but that you don't have to take daily? 

Why don't you just use dope on those occasions when you want to get high? 

I think I'm missing something here.

Also, even if you DID beat him, you're not guaranteed to get your money/product back so basically you'd probably just be doing it for the satisfaction (which i'm sure would be considerable) but once again, it's not really worth an 'assault with a deadly weapon' charge.

BODY: Go check out /r/talesfromthepharmacy. They absolutely can refuse to fill any script they want. And they also say that they know better than your doctor because they specialize in pharmacology while your doctor is only for physical medical stuff. They're right in that they know more about the medication, but it seems to me that the doctor is the one whose orders should be followed. The only judgement a pharmacist should be passing is when two medications could have a negative effect. They should not be refusing a valid prescription for any other reason.

TITLE: First world junkie problems..., POST BODY: When your dealer calls you out of the blue when he knows that you're broke... 

"Why is he calling? I bet he needs a ride again. Last time he needed a ride it was a 10 minute drive just to drop him off at his house and he gave me 4 bags and a crack hit for doing it." 

I got really excited. Then I answered the phone... Silence. Click. 

I call back... "Did you just call me?"

Fucking pocket dial. 

The struggle. It's real. 

(Then again today I spent an awkward hour with him after giving him a ride to meet his dealer who- gasp!- worked on dealer time. I didn't get free bags for that but he did give me like $30 off my purchase and a couple crack hits, so it worked out in the end.) , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/4nui94/first_world_junkie_problems/

"Oh, this is no big deal, it's not the big bad wolf, I can totally handle myself") but then it creeps into your brain so subtly that you don't even really notice until you're waking up sick one morning after having spent your savings chasing that elusive high. 

You can either risk ruining your life, or you can live with the curiosity of what heroin might be like.

That's really amazing, and I'm so glad to hear that the whole fiasco ended up with a positive outcome (well, except for the divorce, but it sounded like that was maybe coming anyway from what i remember?). Are you still going to be able to see your step-kid, though? I know you were worried about that. 

I've been alright-- I am finally working again so things are looking up-ish. What that really means is that I am able to get high a lot more often, so saving money is really not happening at all. But I have a purpose again, and I feel like I'm doing better than I was before I started working again, even with the dope use. 

I get that being around here is tempting but I'm really glad you checked in.

BODY: Be really careful. And keep in mind that if he gets busted, suspicion is also going to fall on you. Your habit will probably skyrocket quickly and if you ever want to quit, you will either have to evict him or move out yourself. Make sure that you write up a contract, i suggest a month-to-month lease just in case things aren't working out or if you decide to get clean. Have that contract notarized (witnessed and signed by a notary public so it's more official). Come up with a separate list of ground rules too: like you mentioned, no customers at the spot, no paying rent in dope (I can just see you being sick one day and broke, and deciding to say fuck it and having him pay you in dope "just this once") and *stick to them* no matter what. Make sure those rules are written out and signed, too. Obviously not for legal reasons, but to make absolutely sure that you're both on the same page. 

This could go either really really well or really really horribly. I don't think there will be any middle ground in this situation. 

Good luck.

Just a heads-up, we came very very close to banning you and honestly the only reason we didn't is because I was too high and nodded out before I could do it. It's really disrespectful to troll this place the way have been, with all of your conflicting and contradictory statements and posts and then you looking down on junkies for being addicts. I basically trust absolutely nothing that you write. You have been taking advantage of our goodwill and honestly you don't deserve the advice that we have given you and you're not worth the time or effort it took for people to actually provide thoughtful and caring advice. It is a scumbag move to take advantage of people here like you have been. You lie and you put us down and then expect us to provide even MORE advice that you won't take and don't need. You really don't deserve this place. 

So if you continue to act the way you have been, you WILL be banned. I'm willing to give you another chance here to prove that you're not just a massive troll but this is it- I'm not going to sit back and watch you disrespect and take advantage of the legitimate members here. We deserve better treatment than that.

BODY: Keep in mind that you'd be taking the spot of a person who legitimately wants to quit. Doctors can only prescribe to a certain number of people at a time. You won't be able to continue doing H since you will get drug tested (you said you're an addict but won't have opiates in your system? So you're clean now?). If you got a script for 16mgs a day, which is probably not going to happen, that's the high range, and sell them at $6 a piece, that's what, $360 a month? Youre also going to have to pay for the script and the doctor and jump through hoops to get prescribed. Doesn't seem worth it to me, especially since like I said youd be taking the spot of someone to whom treatment could be a matter of life and death.

BODY: And I know that you don't want to get off drugs, and I can understand that.but it doesn't have to be forever... Think of it as taking a break so your tolerance goes away, which will make things cheaper if you decide to start using again, and then when you're clean you can get a job and earn enough money so you can start using again if you still want to. Going to detox or rehab will get your tolerance down to a sustainable level. See what I'm saying? If you don't want to quit, don't. But it's pretty clear that you have to do something right now to get your tolerance back to an affordable level.

BODY: There is so much wrong in this post, I don't even know where to start. 

First of all, doing any drug that you've never done before without knowing a single thing about it is **incredibly** unsafe. You didn't even start out with a small amount for safety's sake, you just snorted big lines. Start out small if you don't know how something will affect you.

Fentanyl is incredibly strong and incredibly dangerous, and mixing *any* opiate with alcohol is just asking for an overdose. 

This was your first time doing opiates and now you're asking about heroin? Please stay far away from these drugs. Opiates are unlike any other class of drugs in how they fuck with your brain and how addictive they are. People with absolutely no addictive tendencies at all can become addicted very easily. Opiates start out fun but very soon they take over your life and ruin everything. And even if you do manage to quit, they're still on your mind and in your life forever. It's just not worth it. 

Please, next time you do a drug that you have no idea about, please do research first. I'm assuming you have a cell phone and I'm assuming that cell phone has the internet. It only takes  a few minutes to Google the drug and do research, and that can mean the difference between you staying alive or you dying. What you did last night was insanely stupid. 

Edit: skipped a couple words.

BODY: I'm sorry that you're having a rough time. I really hope you're careful and don't overdo things out of desperation. 

There must be a food shelf or soup kitchen around you, unless you live in a really rural place... Churches also sometimes have vouchers for laundrymats and emergency funds for food. It may be worth actually going and talking to whoever runs them and asking if they have any programs like that. 

**Check out 211**-- it's a website that aggregates a ton of information about local resources like housing, food, medical, etc. 

http://www.211.org/

If you're not able to use the website, you can call them (just dial 211). They will know of what's available for you. 

I really hope you'll be okay, and that there are resources near you that you can access.

BODY: You should take this opportunity to never do opiates again. The more times you go through withdrawals, the worse they get. My first kick was a walk in the park, compared to the last time I went cold turkey. And the longer you use, the more your brain gets rewired and the less chance you have of ever living a good life.

BODY: I was going to say this, also. As a little sister myself, I cannot even tell you how much I idolized my big sisters when I was younger. They were my heroes and I wanted more than anything to be just like them because they were the absolute coolest people ever. I started smoking , drinking, and doing drugs because they did, and I thought by doing that I would be accepted into their circle and that they would think that I was cool, too. Even after I told them that I smoked and drank too and they flipped out and sat me down for a very long lecture, I still thought that and I still continued doing drugs and smoking.

I was only a year older than your sister is right now. She is definitely not too young to start using, and since you room together it wouldn't be that difficult for her to find your stash and try some. 

Please consider this. It sounds like you aren't physically dependant right now and that you're new to opiates in general. This is the perfect time to walk away from this lifestyle and use this experience as a wake-up call. You WILL ruin your life if you continue to use and you WILL become physical and mentally dependant. Once that happens, you can kiss your life goodbye because it's all downhill from there. 

I am so glad that you're okay. I am not trying to be a bitch and I hope you don't take it that way. I am just concerned for you and for your sister. I really hope you will put the opiates down for good.

This might be just as hard on her as it is for you. Her blocking you doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't care -- it might just mean that it's too hard for her to be in contact. Or maybe she needs more time to process things. 

It was really incredibly brave of you to reach out in the first place and I'm sorry that it didn't work out this time. You planted a seed, though. Maybe something will happen and maybe it won't but at least you have done your part.

Why did you decide to start using? Do you know what addiction is like and how risky dope is? That's an honest question- it sounds rhetorical but I actually mean it.

For Carl Solomon

I


I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,

dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,

angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,

who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,

who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,

who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,

who were expelled from the academies for crazy &amp; publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,

who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,

who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night

with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,

incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada &amp; Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,

Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,

who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,

who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi’s, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,

who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,

a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon,

yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,

whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,

who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,   

who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,

who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,

who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,   

who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,

who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,

who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,

who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,

who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,

who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,

who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,

who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,

who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,

who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,

who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,

who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,

who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,

who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may,

who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond &amp; naked angel came to pierce them with a sword,

who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman’s loom,

who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,

who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,

who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots &amp; diner backyards, moviehouses’ rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings &amp; especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, &amp; hometown alleys too,

who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hung-over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams &amp; stumbled to unemployment offices,

who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steam-heat and opium,

who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon &amp; their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,

who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,

who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,

who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts,

who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,

who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,

who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht &amp; tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,

who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,

who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity outside of Time, &amp; alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade,

who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,

who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse &amp; the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion &amp; the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising &amp; the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,

who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer,

who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,

who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other’s hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,

who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,

who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver &amp; waited in vain, who watched over Denver &amp; brooded &amp; loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, &amp; now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,

who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other’s salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,

who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,

who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,

who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism &amp; were left with their insanity &amp; their hands &amp; a hung jury,

TITLE: Narcan and clean needles, POST BODY: Hey everyone.

On Wednesday, I have 5 narcan kits that I can send out, and I can also send out needles. The rigs are 28g, 1/2". **This is only for people who cannot get narcan in their area or cannot afford to get it.** If you're not sure, use these links to find out. 

Packages cost $5, with postage and the envelope. If you can't afford that, I will still send it, but if it's at all possible for you to pay that through paypal, it would help a lot as I am pretty broke right now. 

PM me if you're interested. Right now I have enough to send 5 packages, but I may be able to send out more depending on how many people can pay for their own. **If you can't afford your own postage, don't worry! I can still send them, thanks to a donation from an awesome person (/u/huffinit) and my own funds.**

Just PM me your name and address and whether you want just narcan or rigs too. And whether you can pay for shipping or not. **Either way I will send them to you.** If just narcan I can send it out Tuesday but I won't have rigs until Wednesday. 

I'll take this down when I run out.

TITLE: Narcan and Needles, POST BODY: So, I've got five more packages that I can send out to people who have no access to narcan or clean needles. **Please make sure that there is no needle exchange, CVS, or Walgreens that sells it in your area before PMing me!** [Here is a link to find exchanges in your area.]( http://www.overdosepreventionalliance.org/p/od-prevention-program-locator.html?m=1)

I have 5 packages to send that will go out on Saturday. They are first come, first served. I can send just narcan, narcan and needles, or just needles. **If you can PayPal me the $5 shipping fee, that would be wonderful** (it would also mean that I could send out even more packages) but I am sending the packages regardless.

**If you're interested, please PM me with your name and address, and let me know if you want both narcan and needles or just one of them. And if you're able to pay, let me know that too.**

Oh, yeah, the rigs are 28 gauge, 1/2", 1cc, and the narcan is the nifty new 4mg nasal spray:  http://imgur.com/PeKm1UW

TITLE: Everyone is a person... No matter how despicable., POST BODY: Totally off topic. But tonight at work was really interesting. 

I work in a homeless shelter. I come into contact with tons of different kinds of people, and often- due to the complete lack of organization within my agency- I have no idea who I'm dealing with unless they choose to confide in me. 

Tonight a couple clients were hanging out in the lobby and we got into a long conversation about a lot of different things. 

The woman had only been there about a week. I did her intake and have been wracking my brain trying to remember where I know her from, because I knew her from somewhere. 

Turns out she was a nurse at the rehab I went to 5 years ago. 

The guy in the conversation was so nice and sweet and smart and thoughtful, and we talked about the homeless recidivism rate, addiction in the homeless population, and how strange technology is nowadays. Because he had "been away" for 17 years and I had to show him how to use certain functions on his phone. 

Turns out, He just was released from prison after 17 years after having had molested multiple 10 year old girls. 

There's really no point to this post except that homelessness AND addiction make strange bedfellows, and that it is always worth getting someone's story even if you think their actions are reprehensible. 

I don't know. My job is weird. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/55mqeh/everyone_is_a_person_no_matter_how_despicable/

TITLE: Tis The Season..., POST BODY: ...to run out of dope while on vacation in an unfamiliar town!

Yep, it's the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, when a lot of us travel home for the holidays and many of us end up doing *wayyyy* more than we planned for because, seriously, fuck all that socializing with extended family unless you're crazy high. 

So please, plan ahead and then double what you planned on taking with you, just to be safe. 

And if you DO end up running out, for the love of Junkie Jesus, do ***NOT*** come here to make a post looking for people in your area to sell you drugs! Sourcing is against the rules. I can't even tell you how crazy it gets this time of year. Last year I bet there were 10 posts an hour, and I don't think I'm exaggerating by much. 

So, everyone, be safe, have fun, and don't source!

Much love to all, and to all a good night. 

&gt;**No sourcing!** Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members. Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. 🐢

&gt;**No location-specific posts!** This includes neighborhoods AND cities. 🐢

TITLE: Fent Warning: Kensington, PA, POST BODY: I received this in a PM. 

&gt;I work in healthcare in Kensington Philadelphia, the **scumbag stamp** is one  causing so many overdoses. Users also said the high wasn't great, they went right to being sick. In the past week I had four seizing patients that were foaming at the mouth, and had to be admitted for a few days, and two dead from that stamp. 

&gt;If someone buys those, they better not sell them either, not like dealer level but even just personal use sale. Like if you buy ten for yourself and sell even one to someone else, that particular stamp can get you in trouble.

&gt;if you find this useful could you also make a post telling people not to drive high? I don't use opiates, don't care if others do, unless they drive high. 

TL;DR: **Scumbag stamped bags** are causing overdoses in Kensington, PA. And please don't drive while high. 

**EDIT** I just received another message saying that **Swine Flu** bags are also very dangerous. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/5emr38/fent_warning_kensington_pa/

&gt;Well folks, it seems that it was only a small batch that was tainted- the ODs have gone back to "normal" levels as of today (1 March).

&gt;I hope you all stay safe, and remember- if you don't have anyone else. I care. People here care. I beg of you, *PLEASE* head to your local pharmacy and pick up some naloxone. There's a standing order in MA pharmacies now- and I believe MassHealth (if you're on it) will cover it for free (or for like a buck, I can't remember what the pharmacist told me). Not only to have for yourself, but for your friends.

&gt;Additionally, if anyone would ever like to talk, feel free to PM me. I volunteer with some outreach programs on weekends, and I very much enjoy just talking, listening, and offering whatever help I can. On top of that, I can offer you resources for help if you're in MA- I know some wonderful outpatient places, have MD and RN friends at a couple of buprenorphine clinics in the area... whatever you'd like to try, I'll try to help. Or we can just talk. 

&gt;I just want you to know, that you don't have to be scared or hate all LEOs.

&gt;I wish you all the very best.

BODY: &gt;I used because I felt that I'm going insane, I felt that I'm either going to hurt myself or end up in psychiatry, and dope seemed to be the only choice.

You just summed up the main reason why I use. I have such a hard time explaining this to the people who need to hear it (my counselor, my sub doctor, my family to a certain extent). It's like I can stay on only subs for a small amount of time, but then this pressure starts building in my head and I just *need* to use, because I'm honestly freaked out about what I might be capable of doing to myself. 

I'm sorry that this doesn't answer your question at all.

BODY: I wouldn't go down this road if I were you. IV heroin is for the End Times. 

And no one will be able to tell you what dose you should try. It depends on many different factors like strength and tolerance. When trying a new drug you should always take the smallest amount possible, just so you can tell what your baseline is. The scary thing about dope though is that your "safe" dose from one batch could be an OD dose from the next batch, which is one of the reasons why I will never suggest starting to use dope, even if you have a tolerance to other opioids. 

If you're absolutely dead set (pun somewhat intended) on using, please read the [Getting Off Right guide](http://harmreduction.org/wp-UT /uploads/2011/12/getting-off-right.pdf) in the sidebar for safe needle hygiene practices. And as far as dosing, I'd start  with literally 0.02 and increase that until you start feeling it.

BODY: 3-4 days apart is just begging for a psychological addiction, which soon leads to a physical one. Months in between and keeping it as a special occasion would be the best thing. 

And 10mgs of Xanax with opiates without an opiate tolerance is very dangerous. You got some bad advice.

 Please think long and hard about this. you're playing with fire if you start using opiates, especially if you already use drugs on a daily basis. Opiates are **incredibly** addictive and very, very hard to get off of once you get a habit. They are fun in the beginning but soon you'll be pawning all your valuables for pennies on the dollar, while so sick that you can barely walk.

BODY: If I remember right (it's probably been  about 7-8 years since I've done those) those are a gelled up bitch of a pill to IV. 

IF those are what I'm thinking of, I used a candle, a cooker with a handle, and a q-tip. Light the candle first and drop 100 units of water down for each 30mg pill--and only cook up one pill at a time. Crush the pill (after rubbing the coating off) and set it aside on a piece of paper that is easy to pick up because you'll need to do this one-handed. Get your cotton ready, and it should be the size of a pea so it's easier to draw up through because you need to do this FAST. Put your draw in your mouth for quick access. Make sure the handle of your cooker is either thick enough to not get hot, or wrapped up so you don't burn yourself. Hold it over the flame so the water starts to bubble. When  it's boiling, keep the cooker near the flame so it stays really hot but isn't boiling, and drop the powder in. Shake the cooker around lightly to mix the powder into the water, but this needs to be done fast fast fast. While you're doing that, drop the cotton and draw up as quick as you can, all while still holding the cooker near the flame. Everything will gel but if you do this fast enough and keep the water hot enough, you should be able to get enough morphine out. 

Be prepared to waste a lot of them before you get the technique down. The most important thing here is speed and keeping the water just below boiling.

Do they not understand what's going to happen now? This is going to keep people from getting help if they need it... This is so fucked up. Is there a way we can contact them to let them know how ass backwards this is? "Let's charge people with a crime in order to 'help' them."

And by "research," I mean actual research and not just asking the question here. Research drug equivalency and safe dosing practices, and please talk to your vendor about their procedure for pressing pills. You need to make sure that whoever makes them is making them uniformly and actually knows what they're doing. 

Also, I hope like hell you're telling people that your pills are pressed and not trying to pass them off as the real deal. People need to know that they're getting fent instead of oxy.

I do have to add a disclaimer, though, just as a liability/precaution: there's no way for the mods to verify legitimacy and anyone who makes use of this offer does so at their own risk. 

That being said, thanks again for doing this! It can get really expensive to send out of pocket-it's about $6 for me to send out 3 10-packs- so you might want to think about asking those who can to pay their own shipping via PayPal or something. Most of the time it comes out of pocket so you'll find that any help is welcome.

I worry that seeds will become next to  impossible to find for our purposes if people continue to speak so openly about it. I really think we need to keep it on the DL as much as possible, which means not making posts about it unless it's a harm reduction or safety concern.

I try to not have any mentions of cities anywhere here, even if it seems silly and uneccesary, because i feel like it's easier for everyone- mods and regular subscribers- if it's just a blanket ban on specific locations.

I used to do that all the time and I never had PWDs until I stopped taking subs for a while.i thought since I'd never had them before I would be fine taking them 8-12 hours after dope. Nope.

BODY: I get this whenever I go on binges. Honestly, it only goes away when I stop using. 

The thing I'm worried about with only being affected on one side is cellulitis. 

The doctor may have a way to decrease it but if you continue using it will continue swelling. I get to the point where walking is hard and I have to wear different shoes because my feet are too swollen for my normal sneakers. And it gets hard to walk because bending my ankles is hard. 

I'd maybe get checked out regardless just in case there's something they can do. Maybe check you for cellulitis or blood clots, both of which are dangerous.

TITLE: Second washes: color and potency, POST BODY: I have a couple questions about how potent second washes are. I generally do 2lb - 2.5lb washes (I know, that's a high dose, but I have a really high natural tolerance and also I usually take suboxone daily so that jacks up tolerance as well) and I used the second wash from one batch to second wash maybe 3 batches altogether. So I have [this tea] (http://m.imgur.com/0Ob3S9F) and I'm wondering how potent you guys think it is, in terms of pounds, if it came from 5, let's say, 2lb batches? 

Also, the color of the 2nd washes is only slightly lighter than the first wash, but I'm guessing it's still about 80% weaker. How dependable is color when it comes to judging potency? 

Sorry for all the questions, but I'm relatively new at this since I only do it a few times a month. 

Thanks, everyone. Stay safe. 

Edit: I used the second wash from one batch to do the second wash from another 3 batches. So in that glass is (half) the second wash of 3-4 2lb batches. , PERMALINK: /r/PoppyTea/comments/5zesug/second_washes_color_and_potency/

BODY: Actually, the mods and I have had the off-topic post conversation a lot and decided off topic things can usually stay, provided they facilitate conversation. I've gone through my log of removed posts, and they are all removed because they're breaking the rules, like sourcing or creating drama, or spam that doesn't add anything to the sub. I definitely leave things up that I would prefer to not have here, such as memes. I hate memes and I think they take away from the quality of the sub, but I leave them up because some people seem to like them. I don't think that qualifies as "abuse of mod privileges." I think I'm actually pretty objective about things, and I'd you could read the mod log you would see that.

I disagree with this... He may lie anyway just because he's embarassed or because he thinks he'll lose her, but I don't think it has anything to do with if he loves her or not. In fact, he may be *more* inclined to lie if he loves her, because he may think that she'll break up with him if he tells the truth. 

This is why relationships and addiction is such a bad combination--love makes everything more complicated. Or drugs do, haha.

BODY: Half life of heroin is something like 30 minutes, I believe. And then I found this, not sure if you can read it or not

&gt;Pharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of morphine is 20-40%, and 35% is bound in plasma. Morphine has a short half-life of 1.5 - 7 hours and is primarily glucuroconjugated at positions 3 and 6, to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), respectively. A small amount (5%) is demethylated to normorphine. M6G is an active metabolite with a higher potency than morphine, and can accumulate following chronic administration or in renally impaired individuals. The half-life of M6G is 4 +/- 1.5 hours. Close to 90% of a single morphine dose is eliminated in the 72 hours urine, with 75% present as M3G and less than 10% as unchanged morphine. Heroin has an extremely rapid half-life of 2-6 minutes, and is metabolized to 6-acetylmorphine and morphine. The half-life of 6-acetylmorphine is 6-25 minutes. Both heroin and 6-acetylmorphine are more lipid soluble than morphine and enter the brain more readily.

I worry that seeds will become next to  impossible to find for our purposes if people continue to speak so openly about it.

And before people start giving me shit for "treating my 'friends' differently," this has nothing to do with you, Dori, specifically. Posting there brings us so much negative attention as a subreddit, and it makes the member who posted feel like shit. Enough people look down on us and treat us horribly in real life, and we shouldn't have to deal with the same treatment here. So,  yeah, I want this to be a "safe space" and no, I'm not a "feminazi SJW white knight" either. I just truly love this subreddit and the members here, and I don't want anyone fucking with you guys.

Relapse is a part of recovery, and it can actually be a *positive* thing, as long as you're able to learn from it: what made you relapse; what were you thinking/feeling/doing at the time; what was missing from your recovery at the time it happened, because if you relapsed it means that something wrong with your *recovery*, not with *you.*

BODY: &gt;I was surprised to see that supposedly heroin has little side effects.

Heroin on its own is pretty benign. The side effects are mainly due to lifestyle and ROA (route of administration): lung issues for smokers, nasal cavity issues for snorters, and a whole host of potential health problems for IV users due to the blood involved and the risk of bacteria entering the bloodstream. 

&gt;My family friend used heroin and told me it felt nice. and really overrated.

In my opinion, that's one of the reasons why heroin is so insidious and so easy to get addicted to. Kids are told horror stories when they're growing up and them they try it and are so underwhelmed. They figure since it's so subtle and since it doesn't really change your head space that much, it's no big deal to use it often. That's a part of how it sneaks up on people, I think. 

&gt;My physiology teacher in high school told me it shuts down your entire bodily functions and when you quit, you die.

BODY: I appreciate it-I know you weren't sourcing, and that it's somewhat silly to be so strict when it's such a big city, but it really simplifies things when we don't have to interpret every post to see whether or not we think the OP might be sourcing. And also we'd have to monitor way too many posts to make sure that people haven't started discussions about the city. And a lot of times people will just mention a neighborhood or street they cop on, just shooting the shit. We have the ability to put threads in moderation so we get notified for every new comment and have to manually approve each one, but that is a TON of work to do for something that doesn't really make a difference to the quality of the  post at all. 

Sorry for the long explanation, but it's nice to let people know the method to the madness, and to show that there actually IS a valid reason behind seemingly arbitrary and overly strict rules.

I know you don't have any motivation right now, but can you force yourself to start doing just ONE positive thing? Like, go to the gym or something, get those endorphins pumping.

And your family will see you doing something proactive and they'll start seeing you as the human that they love again, instead of the junkie who they're frustrated with.

BODY: If you're taking subs on a daily basis you can use opiates and not get PWDs when you re-dose subs--although I usually wait until the next day anyway when I start feeling iffy. The reason this works is because so much bupe is built up in your system and the binding affinity is so strong that not all of it leaves your receptors, even if you're still bale to get high. And since some of it remains on your receptors, it will prevent you from beginning sick when you take more bupe and the rest of the dope is ripped off. 

I wouldn't go longer than 2 days without dosing subs, though. But that's just a guess. 

But like the other poster said, you sound probably stop thinking about it.

I wish you weren't ashamed of yourself, but I'm glad that you changed your mind.  When more and more people see us as human beings (that's not hyperbole-we are seen as subhuman by a large percentage of the population), access to life saving services and programs will increase and draconian, ass backwards drug laws that do only harm will be overturned and fixed.

I really couldn't care less where the money I kick down goes- if I choose to give it away, I see it as *no longer mine,* meaning that it is now *their* decision how they want to spend it. I hate those conversations - - "you know they're just going to buy drugs with it..." I've been homeless and I know just how difficult it is and if getting high can brighten someone's day more than a sandwich, then I'm not going to begrudge them that. It's not like that $2 or however much is going to rent them a room or get them a job.

But as I said, half think it will improve quality and half don't. So, I dunno.

As far as your question goes, you will generally know if you're not in the vein or if you happen to slip out mid-shot. Missing dope stings, and you'll have a reddish bump and a crazy histamine reaction also. 

I usually re-register a couple times during my shot, just because I'm paranoid about missing. And I also pull the needle back a *tiny* bit after I initially register (making sure I'm still in the vein) so that when I'm shooting if the needle gets pushed in a bit more from the pressure of depressing the plunger, I know it's still in the vein.

The sub obviously has material on it that can trigger people, which, I'm sorry, it's named r/opiates because we talk about using opiates.  Obviously people in recovery may have a problem with that and if they do, they shouldn't keep coming here.  Blaming us for making someone relapse is ridiculous. It's common fucking sense.

And "this sub is seriously harmful?" Really? I've lost track of how many lives we've saved, and I mean that literally, with narcan and clean supplies. Not to mention how many lives we've saved with information about health risks like abscesses and infections, and all those warnings about fentanyl in specific locations. You call sharing lifesaving information and giving away narcan "harmful?" You need to look that word up again if that's the adjective you choose.

We get enough people looking down on us IRL and telling us we're useless, horrible people, and this sub  is supposed to be one of the few places people like us can go to be treated like human beings.

TITLE: New Rule Regarding Memes, POST BODY: [Introducing: Memeday!](http://imgur.com/a/7sNa0)

Lately the sub has become inundated with memes, and deciding what to do with them has become a controversial issue. Half of the subreddit thinks that they ruin the quality of the sub, and the other half find them funny and enjoyable. The mods spent a lot of time discussing how to handle this issue: do we ban them outright? Do we allow only a certain number of memes per day? Do we only allow high-quality, original memes and if so, who is the judge of what makes a meme "quality?" 

We are aware that we are going to upset half the subreddit with any decision that we make, but I think that we've come up with a workable solution. 

From now on, Mondays on /r/opiates will be Memeday. This means that **no memes are allowed Tuesday through Sunday.** This rule will be strictly enforced (if you would like to post a meme on these days instead of waiting for Memeday, feel free to post on /r/drugmemes) and **memes will be removed, with a ban for anyone repeatedly posting them.** 

And since memes are usually low-effort and low-quality, and to make things a little more fun, we've decided that **only memes will be allowed on Memeday.** This means that any stories or questions that you have **must be posted in meme form.** This encourages creativity and also ensures that we'll always have Original Content on Memedays instead of the usual vapid, mass generated memes that are usually found on Facebook.

This way anyone who hates memes can just avoid the subreddit on Mondays (Memedays), but will be able to safely enjoy it for the rest of the week. 

[Here's a link to a meme generator page,](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator) to make things a little bit easier for the transition. I'm pretty excited to see what you guys come up with for your Memeday posts, and hopefully this settles the issue once and for all. 

**Memeday goes into effect this Monday.**

**EDIT: April Fools'!**

BODY: They do in certain places with a dilaudid mixture (I think) but the problem with that is finding pharmacists who are willing to dispense it for executions. I've read an article before about it and I believe that's the problem they ran into. I'll try to Google it. 

Edit: 

From Wikipedia on execution drug combos:

Primary: Sodium thiopental, 5 grams, intravenous

Secondary: Midazolam, 10 mg, intramuscular, and hydromorphone, 40 mg, intramuscular

In the brief for the U.S. courts written by accessories, the State of Ohio implies that they were unable to find any physicians willing to participate in development of protocols for executions by lethal injection, as this would be a violation of medical ethics, such as the Geneva Promise, and such physicians would be thrown out of the medical community and shunned for engaging in such deeds, even if they could not lawfully be stripped of their license.[31]

BODY: Setting aside the question of morality when it comes to this topic, I feel like the lethal injection would have less room for error than a firing squad. What if bullets miss? People have shot themselves in the head before and survived, so I feel like a lethal injection would be more fool-proof a method (not opiates, though, because of that horrible story about someone taking 2 hours to die). I so imagine that standing in front of a bunch of people with guns who are ready to fire at you would be more distressing thansyimg down on a gurney and getting one injection. 

All options are barbaric, but some more so than others.

Also, Please consider the dwindling availability of good seeds throughout recent years, and the illegality of pods now, before posting about tea in public.  I worry that seeds will become next to  impossible to find for our purposes if people continue to speak so openly about it. I really think we need to keep it on the DL as much as possible, which means not making posts about it unless it's a harm reduction or safety concern.

BODY: Same story as you. Staff meeting with my boss and coworkers and I kept nodding out and doing the speaking gibberish "in my sleep" thing. I said I had a new script for anxiety meds but my doctor wouldn't give me a note because I also tested positive for dope at my next appointment. I actually didn't get fired for that technically, but it led to me skipping another mandatory meeting/training and I got fired for that. If I hadn't skipped I probably would have been fired... Or sent to rehab.

BODY: Please consider the dwindling availability of good seeds throughout recent years, and the illegality of pods now, before posting about tea in public.  I worry that seeds will become next to  impossible to find for our purposes if people continue to speak so openly about it. I really think we need to keep it on the DL as much as possible, which means not making posts about it unless it's a harm reduction or safety concern. 

Posts about tea are not *technically* against the rules here so you don't *need* to remove your post... Unless you want to repost it in the sub I directed you to.

BODY: We've stopped allowing Tinychat to be linked because we've had too many complaints about the room, and the mods aren't comfortable advertising a chat room that isn't run the same way the sub is run and with at least one mutual mod. People have been doxxed, threatened, and bullied through previous rooms and we aren't willing to link to a place where that happens. We would love to have an official TC or other chat room but none of the mods right now have the time or capabilities to do it. Which really sucks because TC can be a great outlet.

Like he said, dude doesn't surround himself with pretty girls just to look at them, and also what the fuck were you doing nodding out in a bed, under sheets, at his house while "hanging out?" It sounds like you completely used the guy for absolutely everything (dope, job, ride to work) and didn't even like him as a person at all so I'd just cut your losses, thank your lucky stars that he didn't actually rape you and that he stopped when you asked him to (if he stopped when you asked him to does that still count as attempted rape?) and be a little smarter in the future. 

~~Also, you may want to drop your attitude and judgement about degrees from community college. Not everyone grows up able to afford an elite college and some people actually have to pay for shit themselves instead of being coddled by a pushover drug dealer or having mommy and daddy pay for their degrees.~~

BODY: My advice (not sure if you wanted advice or just wanted to vent) is to sit down with her tomorrow or whenever you're feeling less emotional about this (that's important, do not attempt this conversation unless you're feeling calm and rational) and tell her how difficult it is for you to be in your situation (living at your mom's house, feeling like you have no privacy, feeling trapped, etc) and how much it contributes to your mental health issues. Let her know that you know she's only doing things like searching your room because she cares, but that it makes you feel like you can't trust her or confide in her at all. Ask her what you can do in order to get more privacy and be trusted more and be treated more like an adult again. Stay calm throughout the conversation and if you feel yourself start to lose it, excuse yourself for a moment and take some time for yourself. 

I'm in a similar situation-- being an adult who had to temporarily stay at my parents house again-- and being treated like a teenager. It's a nearly impossible situation to be in but nothing will change unless you confront the issues head-on. 

Good luck, dude.

BODY: You're talking about percocet and hydrocodone? Hydrocodone doesn't come in 30mgs, was it oxycodone 30mgs? Either way it doesn't matter, give him the clonodine and loperamide now. It won't be too much, and in fact may not be enough. If he's still feeling badly in 2 hours, give him another dose of lope and that should help him out. 

And if he continues taking pills, please please please have him stop snorting drugs with acetaminophen (hydrocodone and percocet). It's really bad for his nose and I believe hydrocodone actually needs to be metabolized through the liver, which means he's wasting it by snorting. And taking so much acetaminophen so often is bad for the liver. There's a video in the sidebar for cold water extraction, which filters out the bad stuff and leaves the good stuff. And make sure he's not taking more than 4000mgs of acetaminophen per day. 

Good luck.

I thought the definition was that the cop got the person to do something he wouldn't otherwise have done, and this fits because there's no way OP would have bought off this guy if he hadn't been pitched. Also, I doubt cops are allowed to sell real drugs to people. Maybe the first time but even then I doubt it. Too much legal liability if the person dies. An informant is different, since they're not an actual cop, but even then I doubt they'd provide real drugs to put on the street.

BODY: I found [this article. ](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/epidemic-addiction/2010/12/why-the-naloxone/)

&gt;The role of naloxone is difficult to understand without knowing a couple facts about the GI system. The human body is designed in a way that allows close monitoring and control of the things that we ingest.  Food or medication that reaches the stomach passes into the small intestine, where the bulk of digestion occurs.  From the small intestine, molecules are absorbed into the circulation and transported to the liver through the portal vein.

&gt;Some molecules are broken down very efficiently when they reach the liver; so efficiently that very little of the substance reaches the general circulation.  This efficient destruction of certain substances is called the ‘first pass effect,’ and applies to the two ingredients in Suboxone—buprenorphine and naloxone.

&gt;Because of the first pass effect, buprenorphine is largely ineffective if swallowed, and so is typically administered intravenously, transdermal (through the skin), or sublingual (under the tongue).  Tablets of Suboxone are intended to be taken sublingually; buprenorphine is a fat-soluble molecule that gains entry into the general circulation via tiny capillaries that lie under the surface of the delicate membranes lining the mouth.

&gt;**Similarly, naloxone is inactive if swallowed.  But unlike buprenorphine, naloxone is a water-soluble molecule that does not pass through the membranes lining the mouth.  When a tablet of Suboxone dissolves under the tongue, buprenorphine passes into the circulation, but naloxone remains behind in the saliva, is eventually swallowed, and is destroyed by first pass metabolism at the liver.**

I'm thinking of roughneckjunkie and how he's clean now but wanted us to see him, and I do love seeing what people look like... And then someone else posted her picture... How would we deal with things like that? Maybe allowing them if they have a purpose or something (but who is to judge that?)... Should we get more input /have a sub conversation.?

Another thing too is I'm thinking about having a monthly "ask the mods/suggestion box" thread. Or maybe weekly. Just ideas for the sub and feedback and complaints and questions, all in one thread? I feel like I'm always hearing "why don't the mods do this" or "why is that a rule" or "we should do this" and unless I happen to read whatever thrrad the comment is on I might miss it.

I've also heard horror stories from old friends of mine on the streets. One kid was forced to cop for his mother when he was around 12 years old, and she'd shoot him up too. Another friends mom was a prostitute and she'd tie him to a chair and then go make her money. She didn't have a babysitter so if he was tied up he couldn't get into trouble and would be "safe," I guess she thought. 

Drugs can make people do horrible shit. It's so heartbreaking.

Removing links here means that they no longer show up on the front page, but people can still come here if they go to OPs profile OR they can follow the comment of someone who posted on the thread (by going to that person's profile page). Removing things *should* have an option to remove the entire thread, comments and all, or something like that. 

Long story short, removing things only makes them invisible on the Front Page, it doesn't do much else.

BODY: I am so torn on the suicide post thing, and I know the others are, too. I completely agree with you on these points:

&gt;it seems like for some people this is their only place to be completely honest.

&gt; I think it could cause more harm than good

and its hard sometimes to remember why we take them down. There are a bunch of reasons and sometimes it doesn't really seem like they're good enough. Those posts tend to attract creeps and trolls who show up just to egg the person on and dare them to do it, or call them attention whores and just completely  lay into them. The posts are sometimes used as a way to troll people here too, and get them all worked up and emotional and upset. It's also a really huge burden to put on people-- they read the post and feel responsible for the OPs well-being, however mistaken that feeling may be, and its way past our pay grade as members. It's pretty common for suicide posts to not be allowed on subs. I know that all those reasons aren't necessarily enough to outweigh the potential benefit of allowing the posts to remain, which is why I'm so divided on it. 

Ultimately I feel like there are different kinds of posts and that they should be treated differently. It's one thing to come here and say that you're feeling suicidal and that you're considering killing yourself, and a whole other thing to make a post saying "peace out, I'm killing myself in 5 minutes." i think that posts that are goodbye posts really shouldn't be allowed, because either there's nothing we can do to change their minds, in which case it really hurts people for no reason, or they are deliberately being melodramatic and playing with people's emotions in order to get attention. But the first example I mentioned I think should mostly be left alone but closely monitored. Or left up for a small amount of time, until they find someone willing to PM them. 

It's a slippery slope. It's what is bad about modding- having to make decisions like this that could potentially have really huge IRL consequences.

BODY: The naloxone has no effect beyond discouraging IV use and as a way to get the patent. It is inactive sublingually so it's not inhibiting any of the suboxone effects, and even if it WASN'T inactive, buprenorphine's binding affinity is higher anyway. There is absolutely no difference between suboxone and Subutex in terms of blocking power and/or strength. Oh, and it's the bupe that causes PWD too, not the naloxone.

BODY: Doesn't mean it's inactive, it means that subs bind better so they cover enough of the receptor. If naloxone was inactive IV, then narcan wouldn't work. 2mgs is the dose in 8mg subs, and that's also the dose of the older narcan.

You still have to deal with the cravings and the way you've totally fucked up your brain and your impulse control and your brain chemistry. I'm not saying that I truly believe addiction is a disease, but it's not as simple as just stopping and then you're fixed. It's an ongoing, progressive thing.

BODY: You should NOT mix bupe and dope!!! Buprenorphine has a higher binding affinity than naloxone and naloxone is inactive sublingually, so it's the buprenorphine itself that causes the PWDs. 

COMMENT:
SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-04-22 18:50:28, SCORE: 1
BODY: &gt; The reason why is because the Naloxone in suboxone will kick out all the opiates in your receptors and push you straight into what's called "precipitated withdrawal"

It's the buprenorphine itself that causes the PWDs, since naloxone is inactive sublingually.

I can't do that if no one tells me what they do or don't appreciate.

BODY: I'm torn about the whole "what do we allow" thing, too. On one hand I agree with you, we are all adults and as long as we understand the risks involved we should be allowed to post whatever. HOWEVER, posts like nude pics that don't have dope in them I feel should go somewhere else, because they really don't belong here. There are other subs for that. And the whole meme thing is just frustrating for me because I felt like they were cluttering up the sub for a while. There were a few days where practically every 3rd post was a meme, and they weren't even that good and they didn't generate any conversation, and if we wanted to be inundated with memes we could just stay on facebook. They also weren't original content, they were just reposts of someone else's creation. 

But I understand where you're coming from and for the most part, I agree with you. When it comes to text posts, I'm down with whatever people want to post because they contribute to discussion and it's a way of getting to know people better.

&gt;I loved him so endlessly and should have tried to help him more

there is often nothing you can do for someone who is in active addiction. You cannot help them if they aren't ready to help themselves and it sounds like he wasn't. I'm sure he understood why you were talking to him less, I know that I don't hold it against people when theyre fed up with the shit i put them through. Please don't beat yourself up, don't let your guilty feelings ruin the good memories that you have of your relationship. 

Again, I'm so sorry. This sub is here for you.

That is *way* too much for the opiate naive, if the seeds are active. You're not going to find unwashed seeds commercially, though.

BODY: Even if you had taken 8mgs, you still wouldn't need to wait a whole 3 days. At 1.5mgs it's not going to entirely block opiates. You'll probably get around 75% of the effect, especially since you haven't taken subs for a while so there's no build up on your receptors. 

If it makes you feel better, I am a "hardcore addict" and I'm also VERY experienced with using while on subs. 

Edit: as a hardcore addict (your term) I have to say that if you're talking about 1 30mg pill, that's not percocet you have. Percocet is oxy with APAP and it doesn't come higher than 10mgs. What you have is straight oxycodone, no APAP.

TITLE: May 7th Is International Harm Reduction Day, POST BODY: I'm not sure how many of you know this, but I send out care packages of narcan and clean syringes on r/opiates. I copied the idea from /u/traceyh415, who has been sending them out for 4 years and has around 250 lives saved so far. I haven't been doing it for nearly that long, but all costs are out-of-pocket. I do ask that the people who can afford to send me the $5-$10 for shipping, but many people either don't have PayPal or legitimatly can't part with that amount. We are drug addicts, after all. 

So today Tracey and I are reaching out for donations, in the spirit of harm reduction. I do have permission from the mods to post this here, and Tracey posted on r/opiates and r/drugs. 

Full disclosure: I do still use, so if you want to donate but that makes you uncomfortable, please donate to Tracey instead. 

 **My PayPal is fashionablyfake82@gmail.com.** Anything helps, and i swear on my reputation as a mod on r/opiates that all donations will be used towards care packages. 

Thanks for letting me post here, and be safe! Happy Harm Reduction Day! , PERMALINK: /r/PoppyTea/comments/69sxa7/may_7th_is_international_harm_reduction_day/

TITLE: How much my sickness is worth, and other Wart tales., POST BODY: The only reason I use the Wart is because they have 10lb WGN and they are cheaper than the river. But they use FedEx for delivery, and the FedEx in my area *never* delivers on time. I get packages usually twice a week, and only a few times have they arrived on the day they were supposed to, because FedEx is short drivers and they often don't have enough to cover my route every day.

This happens all the time, but today I was so irritated that I emailed them to tell them that their shipments are not arriving on time. They refunded me $10 off my latest package, so I guess that's what my withdrawal is worth to them (luckily I had enough to cover it, and have been able to order ahead of time lately). 

Also, the package before this one was for 20lbs, which always comes in 4 5lb bags. This time I only had three bags... so I initiated a chat with customer service, who said that they would put a replacement order in for me if I sent back the original package. Which of course, I couldn't do. I told them that I had been relying on having all 20lbs on that day, and that I couldn't wait for another 3-5 days for the replacement. I asked them why they couldn't just send me one 5lb bag to make up for it? But no, they can't put in a partial order. I don't understand how they aren't able to just create a new invoice and skip the payment, but I guess they can't. So instead, he said they can offer me a whopping $5 in compensation!!! Woo-hoo! Even though the cost was $14... Eventually I had him talk to his supervisor and my account was credited the full amount of the missing product, but still, it was a fucking hassle and a half. 

Oh, and today's shipment? After being a day late? One of the bags was sliced open and about half a pound had fallen out. I was so fed up with dealing with them that I didn't even complain. 

Fuck. The. Wart. , PERMALINK: /r/PoppyTea/comments/6jclwh/how_much_my_sickness_is_worth_and_other_wart_tales/

TITLE: Another loss., POST BODY: I just received word that /u/timbf passed away of an overdose on May 31st. I had contacted his sister because no one had heard from him, either on reddit or through texts, and people were getting worried. She does not know if there was fentanyl involved, or if he had mixed alcohol with heroin, but both are likely. 

Tim was a moderator here for close to a year, and he loved this sub and gave it a lot of his time and energy. He truly felt close to a lot of you, and thought of you as friends. 

Rest in peace, eh? You were loved.

TITLE: In memory of /u/timbf: memorial website and care package fund, POST BODY: I was speaking with a friend of ours from another subreddit, and he asked me what we could do to memorialize Tim. Another friend of ours from that sub had recently died as well, and yet another member created a fundraiser to benefit homeless women, since that was a cause that she was very much a part of (being homeless herself). This friend asked me what kind of charity Tim would be into, and I thought-- the /r/opiates care package fund. 

Tim *loved* reddit. This place, and these members, were his entire life for a long time. He was passionate about harm reduction, and it's just a horrible irony that he died of an overdose when it could have been prevented. 

/u/traceyh415 and I send out care packages of clean syringes and narcan, and we do this for free. We pay, out of pocket, to send these supplies out to members of this subreddit. I know that people here are often not in a position to donate, but if anyone wanted to do something to remember Tim, this is a cause that he believed in wholeheartedly. 

It may seem crass to post this now, but Tim's death (and *any* overdose death) is a huge tragedy. If we can turn that tragedy into something good, and get some benefit from it, I think that Tim would approve. 

A friend made this site to share memories of Tim: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OIDBN7PymQpcDdWsP3pSNfzyd0xZKPRkiu2NUebkJaQ/viewform?edit_requested=true

Please, no trolls. Our friend is manually approving comments so they may take a while to show up. 

If you'd like to donate to me for my care package fund, please PM me. If you'd like to donate to Tracey, please PM her. This is /r/opiates's equivalent of "In Lieu Of Flowers." 

I love you all, and so did Tim. Please be safe.   

Edit: another user brought up a great point, which is that I am still an active/semi active user. Many people here can attest to the fact that I send out a lot of packages, but if you're worried about me getting greedy with the money, please go through /u/traceyh415 instead. It doesn't matter to me who you donate to, it all goes to the same place. 

**EDIT #2:** If anyone needs narcan, or clean syringes, please let me know.

BODY: Thank you! Tracey is seriously the best, she's been doing this for so long and I wouldn't have thought to start myself if it wasn't for her. I feel guilty for taking donations away from her fund, but I sent her some of the ones that I got and I sent some new ones her way, too. 

I got close to $250 from my Tim post, which is fucking incredible. That's anywhere from 25-50 packages and I started out sending 2 narcan doses with each but I started running out too quickly so now I'm just sending one, and everything from this picture is spoken for. I need to re-up already and I still have about 5 orders that I don't have supplies for (getting more by Monday). I'm hoping to stretch the money into 50 packages because it's already gone if it's $10 per. I'll see when I hit the post office tomorrow. 

Anyway, thanks for your vote of confidence!

BODY: Bernese method. It's so you can transition  on to the subs without having to wait 24 hours and without having to go through PWDs. You take sub, start feeling shitty from pwd, do some dope to get out of PWDs, then next time you take subs you should still have enough on your receptors to keep you from getting PWDs again. It sometimes takes a couple days of doing this but eventually it's a pain free way of transitioning, because many people can't wait long enough to take subs without going into PWDs.

BODY: &gt;You've caused a lot of other people discomfort in lots of ways, you can deal with a little in order to get clean and make it right.

Except for some of us, it's not just the discomfort of kicking and then once paws is over it's back to normal. Some of us cannot function without an opiate in our systems. I have tried to go sober and I am miserable and suicidal and unable to function, and that's after a long time of being clean. Some people need opiates for mental reasons, and I'm one of them.

This subreddit is for ALL things opiates, and that includes people in recovery. Yes, some recovery posts are sanctimonious and preachy, but you don't have to read them. People post here because they feel a connection to the sub, and they have people who they may be close to who they want to share their successes with. They may not have that connection with /r/OpiatesRecovery. 

Please don't tell people that it's not okay to post here. That's not your job and you're wrong about it, anyway.

If the mods had been active on reddit and not doing their job then I do think it deserved to be banned, because it had turned into a sourcing sub. But the most recent mod who was active was Kicker, who is in jail and only checked in once in the last 5 or 6 months when he got ahold of a cell phone, and the mod who was active the most recent before that was HK, 7 months ago. The others hadn't been around for a year or more. So why would they ban it instead of give it away? It makes NO FUCKING SENSE. 

I appealed their decision.

TITLE: A reminder about sourcing, and subreddit rules., POST BODY: Sourcing is STRICTLY against the rules here. Anyone making sourcing posts or comments is asking for a ban. Sourcing will get our subreddit shut down, so the mods take it very seriously. 

Here are the rules from the sidebar:

&gt;No sourcing! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members. Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. 

&gt;No location-specific posts! FOR ANY REASON. This includes neighborhoods AND cities. 

&gt;MEET-UPS ARE NOT ALLOWED for ANY reason! Any posts about meet-ups will be removed. We are not responsible for anything that happens outside of this subreddit.

If you see a sourcing post or comment, please either report it or page one of the mods: /u/traceyh415, /u/FashionablyFake, /u/travs3dpe, /u/spinderella69, or /u/chasing-d0pamine.

BODY: For whoever wants to know what happened to the sub:

This is a PM I received from a throwaway account. 

***

&gt;That sub was a honeypot for law enforcement to abuse, not to mention a really fucking shady place to get a hookup. Dangerous to users for multiple reasons. It shouldn't have existed in the first place and it needed to go.

&gt;Last week I anonymously tipped off 15 different local law enforcement agencies around the country, ranging from one of the largest PDs to a small rural one to a couple of statewide ones. Why? If I'd just tipped off one agency then it would have been easy for them to use it for undercover operations and bust users. I figured if I tipped off a slew of agencies at once, there'd be so much LE focus on it that admins would be forced to take action and it couldn't be used for LE operations for very long. Within a few hours of making my reports, readers on the sub increased from an average 20-30 to 350 and then dropped off sharply around 5PM. That's when I knew it had caught the attention of LE. Sure enough the next day there was heavy traffic during business hours and then the usual 20-30 at night.

&gt;A week later it was banned. I don't know what happened behind the scenes but I'm assuming Reddit received requests for data from LE agencies and freaked out and banned the sub and deleted all its posts.

&gt;Sorry you now have to deal with all the people trying to source in your sub, but sourcing subs shouldn't exist publicly: if they're gonna do that then do it in a private sub (still a terrible idea IMO, but better than a public sourcing sub). Shit, people just need to learn to use DNMs.

BODY: I think i asked /u/traceyh415 about this a while ago, and if I'm remembering correct she said it was better than nothing. 

The problem (I think) is that bupe is a partial agonist. So while it does rip opiates off receptors, it can also possibly add to the opioid effects. 

I could be wrong about that, I am bad with science. But I think that since subs shoves opiates off receptors just like narcan, it should have *some* benefits.

&gt;We have come across some fake A 215's in Phoenix over the last month or so. They have a strong dose of fent and unlike all other fakes previously seen, they are impossible to visually distinguish from the real thing. We have entered a new era, please inform users of this and to be extremely careful. They do not taste the same (somewhat soapy I'm told), it's the only way Short of a chemical test that they can be told apart. Very scary. The cartels have finally mastered the format it appears.

BODY: It's just like a methadone clinic, except with heroin, for people who have failed all other forms of treatment. Studies have shown that people on heroin treatment are more likely to wean themselves off of it than people on methadone. 

Heroin is a pharmaceutical drug also, just like methadone and buprenorphine. And just like some people don't respond well to bupe but do have success with methadone, some people fail with methadone and the heroin treatment works. 

As long as heroin is legal and available, most of the negative societal impacts disappear. It's only when people can't get it and when it's illegal that the problems start. For the most part, that is. If we could get affordable dope from a dispensary, would we have to cheat and steal for it? Would we have to miss work because we can't find it or because we got locked up buying it? No. We'd be able to hold down jobs and lives and be completely normal.

BODY: One thing I love about this sub is that people are open to hearing arguments other than their own, and I love that you genuinely thought about this and are willing to discuss it. 

Alcoholism is a bit different because it's already legal, cheap, and accessible. And it is harder for someone to function if they are drunk. I can work without batting an eye on dope, but if I'm drunk then forget it. No way would I trust myself. So the argument for a clinic for alcoholics is a bit different than one for opiate addicts. However, I have read about a homeless shelter that gives alcoholics a certain amount of alcohol every day, and I think that's great. 

Basically, my opinion is that no one deserves to have their lives ruined because of addiction. And that getting clean is obviously ideal, but in certain cases, for certain people, it's just not feasible. In those cases I think drastic measures are called for, and having a heroin clinic, or a shelter that provides alcohol for alcoholics, is pretty much one of the only answers to an unanswerable problem.

BODY: No. I think that if people spend any amount of time here besides just reading a few posts, they'll see that we're not glorifying anything. Sure we talk about the good parts of our drug use, but the overarching message of the sub is that this is a shitty existence and to run away as fast as you can. It's fucked up that we're not allowed to see anything good in this lifestyle, and that we're judged and looked down upon and accused of glorification if we happen to admit that we're not totally miserable 100% of the time. 

As far as it being dangerous to people in recovery, I think that it definitely can be. And I also think that it can reaffirm people's dedication to staying clean.

BODY: You have to tell people that you're not using and to not offer you drugs. Otherwise you're going to continue getting in these situations and being tempted. You have to sabotage your future self. It's hard to do, though. I always leave myself a loophole of I'm trying to stay clean because I figure I'll want to use at some point so I want to leave my options open. But if you're serious about staying clean, you can't do what I do. You have to nip it in the bud now, by letting everyone know you're clean and planning on staying that way.

BODY: &gt;the slapping will only work if the person OD'ing didn't go unconscious, because then it's too late. 

&gt;Because Fentanyl doesn't last long, all he had to do slap the fuck out of me non-stop until it wore off

That's not how it works. I don't want people reading this and thinking it's all good and they can wait a while trying to revive someone just with physical stimulation. If someone doesn't respond to slapping or a sternum rub after a minute or two, call an ambulance. That's quite a long time when you're dealing with oxygen deprivation, so I'd actually say to give it less than a minute. You don't know how long it'll take for the EMTs to get there so you need to call as soon as possible. You don't have to say it's an overdose-- just say that your friend is unconscious and you don't know why, or even tell them it's a heart attack or something. That way they won't send the cops also. Obviously tell them the truth when they get there, but by then they most likely won't even bother calling the cops. 

**edit:** do you have narcan available where you live? There's a narcan locator in the sidebar if you're not sure.

Being homeless is hard enough, who the fuck am I to judge someone for wanting to escape their reality. If I cared what it was spent on I'd give food instead. 

It's good that you paid for the room instead of giving him that money, though. I think it's great you helped him out. He'll get a few days in a room, he'll get well for a little bit, and the cherry on top is that you probably restored his faith in humanity, at least for a little while. Kindness is underrated.

BODY: We can't read every single comment here, even though we try to. So some comments do slip through the cracks. We try to keep the moderation equal but we can't screen every single comment on every single thread, it's just not feasible. 

I know that you're not discussing sourcing. But from being here for 5 years I can tell you that location-specific threads often devolve into sourcing of one kind or another. With the admins so ban-happy nowadays, we're just not willing to risk an innocent location comment turning into something else. And since we can't monitor every comment 24/7, it's safer for us to just disallow any location specific content, regardless of the original poster's intent. Because it's often not the OP who starts sourcing, it's usually someone who sees the totally innocent post or comment and then starts asking for connects or discussing specifics. 

If you want to have a conversation about where you live that is unrelated to this sub and isn't sourcing, feel free to do so privately. But having specific locations mentioned in public is asking for someone to show up and start using it to source. And like I said, I'm not willing to risk the entire subreddit just so one member can have an unrelated conversation with another member. 

The rules are necessary. I definitely don't enjoy enforcing them, especially when it seems like there's no reason for it. But I've seen countless threads start out innocently enough and then turn into something else, and I'd rather be seen as over-reacting than have the sub shut down because someone saw the comment and decided to try to make a connection.

BODY: Check the sidebar. Does it or does it not say that location specific posts are not allowed? It does, which means that I am not arbitrarily deciding that a "conversation is not to my liking" and removing it. You're right. Rules are black and white, and not open to interpretation. And if you read the sidebar, it's there in black and white. "no location specific posts. This includes neighborhoods and cities." 

I was only trying to explain to you *why* that rule exists. I didn't write it, but I understand why it's in effect. And it's not really a good use of anyones time to have to sit on one thread and screen every single comment just because one person feels like mentioning their city. If you go through my post history, though, you will see me posting reminders on certain threads instead of just removing the entire conversation. But with city names, I just go ahead and remove them, because that's what it states in the rules and many mods before me decided it was necessary.

BODY: The other mods can tell you that I'm really careful when I mod to not let my personal opinions affect my moderation. There have been many times that I vote to allow something to stay up because it doesn't break the letter of the law, even though I personally think it's a horrible thread. So I take it somewhat personally when  someone tries to tell me that I'm acting emotionally and modding on a whim. Especially when the rule is right there I  the sidebar, and I'm just following that edict.

Maybe it's unethical in some respects to prolong someone's addiction by prescribing them opiates. But you're doing that to save their life. If they leave, they'll die, and then they'll never have the chance to get clean.

SUBREDDIT: opiates, TIME: 2017-08-04 02:47:17, SCORE: 4
BODY: My sub doctor is fine with the Adderall, but he wants me to get it through a psychiatrist, not him. He USED to script it but I went off of it voluntarily a couple years ago. Now I'm working again and feel like I need it again, and he's fine with me taking it but I think he's using it as a bribe to get me to start seeing a psychiatrist again. He knows I'm not going to go unless there is a carrot, so he's saying that he wants the shrink to write it. 

So, I went to a psychiatrist who refused to give me Adderall, even though I had been on it for about 5 years with no problems, and even though my doctor said he wanted me to be on it if I thought I should be. The psychiatrist would not give me anything except vyvance, which didn't really do anything, and he treated me like such an addict that I didn't feel comfortable asking for a dose increase. He also UA'd me every time I went in, I'm not sure if that's normal for a medication like vyvanse... 

So I stopped seeing him and went to another shrink, who I met for the first time last week. She said that she wasn't comfortable prescribing it to me at the first appointment, which I completely and totally understand. She said that she also wanted to touch base with my doctor to make sure that this was something that he felt I needed, and/or to make sure he was okay with it. And then she said that if he says he's fine with it, then she will keep it in mind, but she made it sound as though she was going to make me jump through hoops and wait a while before getting it. She made it sound like an "Eventually, I may feel comfortable prescribing it" kind of thing, instead of a "You'd been on it 5 years, you clearly have ADD, and your doctor who has known you for 15 years told me that he wants you on it, but you're an addict (even though you have zero history with stimulants) so clearly you can't handle taking the medication" kind of thing. 

I'm just sick of being treated this way. I know what works for me, I know that there is a medication out there that can make my life so much easier and take away so much of my mental pain (the benzos) but I can't get it because these doctors would prefer that I suffer and contemplate suicide and lose my jobs and livelihood rather than let me take a couple pills a day. 

Once you're branded an addict, you're no longer human to a big chunk of the world. You become your addiction, nothing more, nothing less. It is assumed that you are a slave to not just your DOC, but literally any drug that changes your brain chemisty. I am so sick of having to defend myself to these strangers who write me off as just another drug seeking junkie. Shit, I almost died from untreated endocarditis because the doctor I went to see thought I was drug-seeking, even though I had a fever of 103 for a week and never even asked for any drugs at all. Nothing. Not even tylenol for my headache.

Okayyyy, wow. Sorry, I'm high and rambling and seeing my docs this week and talking to /u/travs3dpe tonight about how junkies are perceived made me get a little up in arms about it all. 

End rant.

People try to post vague sourcing posts all the time and the mods are used to it. You don't have to come right out and say "I am looking for drugs." Hinting around about it isn't allowed either. 

Let me know if you need any help, but your history is full of subtle sourcing. I explained the rule as much as it's possible to be explained so I'm assuming you understand it now.

BODY: We can compromise and put the whole thread into moderation and manually approve each comment, I guess. This was something that concerned me too but I thought that, judging from the discussions on most of the Fent threads, it wasn't really necessary to leave the thread open. A lot of the comments are things like "I copped here yesterday" or stuff like that. 

We have had a heavy hand moderating recently, but that's because the admins have had a heavy hand banning subs. I don't like being so focused on policing but I'm worried about the entire sub. 

People can also PM the OP with questions, and the OP can edit the post if there's new information. So I can see it happening both ways.

BODY: I have to agree with you. Gambling just seems even worse than spending it on drugs... It seems to me like it's literally tearing money up into tiny little pieces and flushing it down the toilet.

I know everyone can choose what they want to spend their money on, but at a time in my life when I'm using quarters from my couch to pay for postage and asking my landlord not to cash the rent check yet, it makes me feel like screaming. But also at the same time, I just wasted a bunch of money on drugs so I can't really talk. Whatever makes people happy, I guess.

BODY: I've heard KFC does the same thing as chick fil-a because the owners son had been homeless at one point. I'm pretty sure I'm not mixing the two up. 

Also, just asking people walking down the street for their leftovers is sometimes successful. A lot of people get doggie bags because they don't want to waste the food, not because they actually want it. I've eaten some gourmet shit when I was homeless that I'd never have the chance to eat now. 

Dumpster diving supermarket dumpsters can feed you for a while, too. They have to throw food out if it's past its sell-by date, and food almost never goes bad until days after the sell-by date.

BODY: The only thing I've found that's gotten me out of PWDs is more heroin. Just be REALLY FUCKING CAREFUL because it can get you well without you actually feeling high from it-- which also means that it can make you overdose without you actually feeling it. 

This works with PWDs from suboxone. I think vivitrol is stronger than suboxone, though, so I'm not sure how well it will work. 

Go to the ER if you have to, you don't want to lose too many fluids and get dehydrated.

This is your problem right here. You can be under, over, or to the side and still have it look like it's in.

BODY: Its the same as if OP asked if it was safe driving 30mph in a 30 mph speed zone, and you said "No, I wouldn't risk that because I was in a bad accident when I drove 160mph in a 30mph zone."

BODY: Oh, I definitely see your point too. But to expand the analogy, it's like asking if one beer at 30mphs is safe vs. a 6-pack and 160mph. 

In any case, I'm not trying to bust your balls. Just enjoying playing around with metaphors or analogies or comparisons or whatever the fuck they are.

BODY: There is a HUGE difference between the amount of fentanyl in a pharmaceutical product and the amount in an unmeasured, unregulated home-made street press. You may think fentanyl is a walk in the park when you're doing regulated amounts of it. But take home a bag of what you think is heroin or a pill that you think is oxy, that actually contains god-knows-how much fent, and it won't matter what your experience with dope/pills/prescription fent is. You'll drop like all the rest.

TITLE: Oh, how things change..., POST BODY: I'll probably delete this when I wake up in a few hours, but I'm posting for now because I'm drunk and tired and things are so fucking different. 

I'm watching this show (The Killing--fucking awesome show, check it out) and there's this scene and I swear to fucking god it's straight out of my memories. It's a bunch of kids at a youth shelter sitting around waiting to see who gets beds. When I was homeless I spent one night in a shelter (I was maybe 17 or 18) but it was set up in exactly the same way, and I hadn't thought about it in such a long time. I was still in --city-- and my fiance was still alive and I was still okay being a little junkie streetpunk. 

But, now, 14, 15, 16, 17 years later, I'm sitting in my own fucking apartment, having just been asked by my boss to take a more permanent position at my job, looking at the small but still positive numbers in my bank account, and I've come a really fucking long fucking way from that kid who squatted under bridges and shot tar into her femoral and neck and watched all her friends die and panhandled day in day out in the rain and the snow. 

A couple years ago-- shit, a few fucking months ago-- things were so fucking bad that I honestly didn't know if I'd wake up the next day, or even if I wanted to at all. I let shit get away from myself, in a major way, in ways that I won't talk about but can't be fixed. I didn't think that anything mattered anymore, because I was just waiting around to die. 

So, uh, yeah. Point being, um.... shit's rarely as hopeless as you think it is. Maybe. I mean, maybe it is. But what if, just maybe, your life takes a fucking 180 turn? Don't do anything irreparable to yourself, or to others. Even the worst circumstances can change. Maybe. Or maybe not. I don't fucking know. 

I'm a long way from being clean so this isn't meant AT ALL as a "don't do drugs, kids" PSA. Just want to say that I have faith in all of you, and maybe shit won't work out for you. But maybe it will. I hope it does. I wish I hadn't acted like nothing would get better, the past 17 years. That's all. 

Love you guys. I'm sure i'll delete this shit in the morning. Blah blah blah, goodnight.  , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/6vhla0/oh_how_things_change/

TITLE: My friend died., POST BODY: I've had so many friends die over the years, it's not even much of a shock anymore when it happens. But for some reason, this one has really gotten under my skin. 

We weren't even really that close... we trusted each other completely, which is rare in this game, but for the most part he was a using friend and not much more. He'd swing by my house and pick up my money, go and pick up, and when he dropped it off for me he'd always hang out while I did my shot just in case, because he knew I always used alone and didn't want anything to happen to me. 

He had a wife and a 3 year old daughter named Kaia and a month before he died he and his wife learned that they were having another child. He couldn't get clean and so he kept on using and he died alone, and his child will never know its father, and Kaia will most likely not remember him at all when she gets older. He's just... gone. Like his life meant absolutely fucking nothing. 

Why do we do this shit? If you think about it, like really think about it, what's the fucking point? I know why I use, and it's the same reason why a lot of people do: we can't handle reality, we can't handle our minds, we can't handle our emotions, and we can't handle ourselves. But when did we decide that life was cheap enough to throw away? 

I'm not saying that I think that my life is precious or worth anything, and I actually wouldn't really be upset if I died right now, but it's just baffling to me that we deal with this on a daily basis. Dusty is dead. His wife is alone. His daughter won't remember him, and his unborn child will never know him. And for what? So he--and we-- can stick a piece of metal into our arms and feel human for a brief amount of time. And when another person dies we shake our heads and cluck our tongues and say what a waste and what a shame it is, and then we go and do another shot because we've completely forfeited the right to have our lives be worth anything more than the cost of a bag or a bundle. 

Despite how this post reads, I don't actually have a strong desire to stay alive. But I wish that I lived the kind of life where death is an anomaly, where it means something, instead of the life of a hopeless junkie to whom death is pedestrian and so commonplace that we stop being shocked and affronted by it. 

I just keep picturing him prepping his shot, maybe rushing because he had to pick up his daughter from day care, or drop his wife off at work, and thinking he'd have the time to do whatever it was that he had to do and not knowing that those were the last few seconds he had on earth. 

It's so fucked up. I'm so angry with all of us for living the kind of life that takes the meaning out of being alive. 

If you think about all the energy that goes into raising someone, all the years and years of nurturing a person to adulthood, and then it's all gone in the blink of an eye for literally no fucking reason... Addiction is life boiled down to nothingness. It's all the blood and sweat and tears of loving someone just come to nothing in the end. What the fuck's the point of ever loving anyone if they can just be snatched away in the time it takes for you to take a breath? 

Fuck it. I learned this lesson long ago, I'm just surprised that it's affecting me this way right now. 

Also funny/ironic thing--first time I met Dusty he gave me a couple free bags because it was the anniversary of my fiance's death and I could only afford to get one and he felt bad for me. Death always comes full circle. 



RIP Dusty. Thanks for being my friend. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/77z795/my_friend_died/

TITLE: Holiday PSA!, POST BODY: Merry Xmas, everyone! 

I know that a lot of people are going out of town for the holidays (or their dboys are) and as such maybe running out of dope too soon. God forbid if that happens, but **please don't turn to r/opiates to find dope!** Sourcing is very much against our rules, and it can get the entire subreddit shut down. 

Here are the rules, from the sidebar:

&gt;&gt; 2. **No sourcing! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, *including other subreddit members, online markets, and/or vendors.* Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued.** 🐢 🍁
&gt;
&gt; 3. **No location-specific posts! This includes neighborhoods AND cities. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn.** 🐢 🍁
&gt;
&gt;4. **MEET-UPS ARE NOT ALLOWED for ANY reason! Any posts offering or requesting meet-ups will be removed. We are not responsible for anything that happens outside of this subreddit.** 🐢 🍁

Please either report sourcing posts that you see by clicking the "report" button underneath the post, or by paging one of the mods in the comment section by just writing our name like this: /u/FashionablyFake (for me). 

Be safe, everyone! Don't drink/get high and drive! Do test shots! 

Peace, bitches.

The parameters got messed up and some people can't comment if it's longer than 1 character. The admins ARE aware of the issue and they're working to fix it. 

For now, you can make a comment with one character and then edit it to say what you want. Hopefully it'll be fixed soon, but the admins ARE aware, and there's nothing the mods can do ourselves.

Stamp is called Starbucks in black ink. Dealer told me tocinitially be careful because it was “strong” tested it with 2 bags with a 2 bun tolerance and I fell off for 2 hours IV. Just woke up. Bags are very very fine white powder, no chunks, very white color... draws up clear like water. Please keep me anonymous and get the word out.

Locking per policy.

Edit: I received another message from a different user:

&gt;Can definitely confirm that this stuff is out there as it has killed two of my close friends in the past week (not simply using buddies). The batch that was used to make this stamp also is being packaged under other names for sale down the shore. I would advise anyone in the shore counties to please be extremely careful and test everything whether shot or snorted with 1/2 to 1 bag only. , PERMALINK: /r/opiates/comments/7y9oxn/fent_warning_toms_river_nj/

Apparently it was much funnier when we came up with it than it actually turned out to be... but yeah, like I say all the time, JUNKIES CANT FUCKING SWIM. 

Congratulations to those who called it as a prank--you win absolutely nothing because we are too broke to have a prize. 

For everyone else, our sincere apologies if we freaked you out. It honestly seemed pretty funny when we were discussing it initially. 

TL;DR: Don't SWIM here. Junkies sink.

TITLE: Harm Reduction Awareness Day (better late than never), POST BODY: May 7th was the [International Harm Reduction Awareness Day](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalHarmReductionDay/). The mods felt that it would be a good time to ask for donations for our care package program. If anyone doesn't know, /u/traceyh415 and I send out clean needles and narcan to people who can't access any where they live. To date she has saved somewhere in the ballpark of 200 lives over the last couple of years, and I have saved around 10-15 that I know of. Most of our costs are out-of-pocket; we don't charge for the supplies, and most of the people who request packages can't afford to pay for shipping. 

If you do want to donate, both Tracey and I have PayPal. Tracey also accepts bitcoin (I'd be willing to learn how to set up a wallet if necessary). Everything helps-- like I said, we fund 90% of this out of our own pockets. 

If anyone needs proof that the donations are going to this project and not into our own veins, I'd be happy to provide pictures of receipts. 

We really appreciate the help we've received from everyone on r/opiates, and we want everyone to continue to be as safe as possible. 

If you'd like to help us out, please PM either me (/u/FashionablyFake) or /u/traceyh415 for our information. 

Thank you all, and we love all of you. 

Stay safe.

I wasn't sure if I even should, but I think he would want to be remembered.  It's a good reminder to everyone that no matter how safe you think you're being, no matter how long you've been using or how high your tolerance is,  you're still flirting with death every time you take a hit. Have narcan. Use with a friend. Do test shots. 

I love you all, and I really don't want to see any more RIP posts here. We've lost too many people, online and off. Tell your friends and family that you love them, and be good to yourself and others. 

(PS: I think everyone would be proud to know that this sub raised $350 last year for the care package fund, on tim's behalf/in his memory. So thank you all for that, too!)

TITLE: Fake 30s warning: Boston area., POST BODY: I received another PM from someone--

&gt; Greater Boston area. Have been getting blues from this same group of guys for awhile. Always been straight script pills. My usual dose is 30mgs oral and 15 msg 45 minutes after the initial dose. These K9s were absolutely flawless and had consistent color, sheen, and durability as all the other K variation oxys. Well I ate one and instantly noticed that the taste was really weak and was def not oxy. I waited a good hour and wasn’t feeling much at all where as with a real blue I would be buzzing pretty hard and preparing for the rush from snorting. Well being an idiot I decided to just snort a half of the other pill. Didn’t even feel high for like 10 minutes and just as I was starting to think it was bunk filler presses I got smacked with a surprisingly unpleasant nod. I remember trying to eat a popsicle trying to fight the intense nod taking over me, next thing I know I’m in a haze of paramedics yelling as if they were far away. Kinda remeber puking in the ambulance the second time they narcanned me. They say i was brought back twice, once when they got to me and then I fell out again in the ambulance which was when they sprayed me again and I puked. The whole thing is still a blur but the nurse said they had to use 4 doses of Narcan in total to keep me stable until the Ivs were set up. I’ve already told my boys what happened and the plug said he’s gonna warm people from now on but I fucking doubt that. I got out of the hospital and detox last week and these fuckers are getting around in my town. People are dieing and I gaurentee it’s these K9s

She saw my file and that was that. Eventually I couldn't really take care of myself so my roommate called my mother and she took me to the hospital, where they told her if I'd waited any longer to come in they may not have been able to do anything for me.

The second time I felt okay and probably wouldn't have gone in but my doctor (my *actual* doc) wanted to do a blood test just in case because my risk of infection is higher than normal, and it came back as endocarditis. Just early symptoms but I was still hospitalized for a week and I still had to do IV antibiotics for a couple months after.

We provide harm reduction information on how to use more safely, and we also provide emotional support for people who are marginalized and ostracized by the majority of society. It's a place where we can come and not be judged and treated like shit just because we're addicts. And for that reason, I'm taking this post down.

BODY: There's no exact formula for how many days you can go but generally you shouldn't use more than like 3 days in a row. If you've never had a dependance before you most likely won't get withdrawals after 8 days but any amount of consecutive days use is a risk. You should stop now for as long as possible and if you start again, don't use more than a couple days in a row.

If you go back and refresh the sub, you won't see it in the queue. But if you go to OPs profile or to your comment (or anyones profile who commented here) it will still be visible. If it was a text post it would just say [removed] but since it's a link, the image is still visible.

Hope that made sense... It's hard to explain.

You should really stay far away. Opiates are unlike any other class of drugs in that they sneak up on you and you're hooked before you even notice there's a problem.

BODY: you may think you know the risks, but I don't think you actually *understand* them if you're willing to keep using a drug that has already only made you sick. it doesn't seem like you really comprehend how completely your life can be taken over by this addiction. this drug has the power to make you forget about everything you've ever cared about, and it can make you do things you'd never even considered before. take all the people you care about and cut them out of your life now, because once you're addicted there is a huge chance you'll do something awful to them just to get well for another 8 hours. faced with a choice between stealing from your dying grandma and being dopesick, there's a chance you'll gladly choose the former. shit there's a chance you'll *look forward* to that opportunity. 

why would you want to risk that for a drug that you don't even enjoy?

Also, taking dosing recommendations from people online is a slippery slope since everyone's natural tolerance is diferrent. a tiny dose for one person may be a huge dose for another. if you do decide to use, you should check out the [Tripsit factsheets](http://drugs.tripsit.me/).

We wanted to add 2 new mods, and we did choose 1, but now some of the people who applied before are inactive or not interested anymore. We figured we would start this process over, but give ourselves a STRICT timeline: **applications will be accepted through Saturday, March 2nd, and then we will pick the ~~winner~~ loser by Saturday, March 9th.** 

This is NOT a reflection of anyone who applied before! We welcome the older applicants to re-apply (and actually we would prefer it so we know who still wants to mod). 

**We have created a closed subreddit for applications. You must message the modmail of r/opiatesmodapplicants. ALL applications MUST be PMed to us here: https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fopiatesmodapplicants**

**Applications sent privately to specific mods, or to r/opiates modmail, will be disqualified.** We ran into some problems last time when applications were going to ten different places, so hopefully this will fix it.  

Please let us know the following:

We need someone that will be very active daily, and that will actually invest and commit to doing this for our community. Below are the requirements, and the application for those interested. 

#This will be open for application until 3/2. Please send all applications to modmail at r/opiatesmodapplicants--Please not the modmail for this sub, or to any mod directly!
