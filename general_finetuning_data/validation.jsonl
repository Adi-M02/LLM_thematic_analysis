{"text": "I just wanted to give you guys a heads up, I was diagnosed with partial radial nerve palsy in my right wrist from nodding off in a weird spot on my hand. This usually only happens when you are intoxicated, as when the body is sober it will naturally reposition itself during sleep. However, I was nodding off in a weird ass position and the next morning i couldnt flex and could barely move my right hand. I also have this thing called \u201cwrist drop,\u201d which means i cannot extend my wrist because of the radial nerve palsy. The doc said itll take 4-6 weeks to heal and for me to regain mobility in that hand. Just wanted to let you guys know, as I did not think one night of sleeping weirdly would cause such a big problem with a long healing time. Im out of work as well since i cannot write at all because i cant grip anything. When nodding off, make sure you arent in a weird position!

I waited to post this to make sure I go through the month. Even though it has been a tough couple years for me I've managed to stay strong and for the most part positive.

I give out for free Kratom, Kava Kava, CBD and other such things to help my members stay clean or get clean. I have noticed a really good result because of these practices.

Multiple attempts at detoxing, multiple failures, rehab check ins that lasted 2 weeks had led me to believe that I was incapable.

{"text": "Hello cool cats, it's been a while since ive posted, but some of you probably know me as the poppy tea guy (i get about 10 messages a day asking about the process of making the tea and places to order seeds from, but i don't mind! Ask away im happy to help!)\n\nAnyways i keep at least 40 pounds of poppyseeds for emergencies so i haven't gone through any withdrawals in a very long time (been abusing opiates for about 5 years now), i tend to drink about 2-3 pounds a day and i estimate I get about 80-150mg of morphine from that amount (I wash each batch of seeds 4 times to get every bitnof morphine i can) I always see people posting about withdrawals and i wonder why more of y'all dont keep seeds stocked just in case? They are cheap, legal, and its very easy to get morphine from them, doesn't even take 10 minutes.\n\nIm feeling really up and talkative today so i wanted to post something. If anyone has questions about poppy seed tea, the best methods to use, or websites where you can LEGALLY order it let me know. Just because we're addicts doesn't mean we need to go through withdrawals. I hope all of you have a happy, healthy, and safe day. Be careful out there. \n\n\n\nPeace  -FerretHydrocodone\n\n\nEdit: wow thanks for all the messages and replies everyone! This is the first time my inbox has actually \"blown up\".

In some weird way, I wish I could sill drink or smoke or take other pills, and those suppressed longings are turning into something different. \n\nThat being said, I have no intentions of doing so.

Saving money. \n\nWeird - I don't want to use BAD here because things are improving from all angles, I also don't want to make it seem like a rose garden. So... I'm still having gnarly morning GI that tapers off. Still can't totally relax without some restless feet. Lingering anhedonia that comes in waves. Still sorta anxious about the feeling of not enjoying day to day life things that I used to. Sleep is still hit or miss, starting to hit more. Still dreading the length of days in the morning and how I'm going to keep my self occupied without being able to relax as easy. (That's the shit I hate the most). \n\nI was talking to someone last night about how most of us do enough research to have PhDs in this shit. Sometimes I wish I had a simple tracked mind that didn't try to identify all the bullshit that takes place.

I actually caved Friday morning and went to my guy and ended getting beat, the bags were 95% percent cut, I was just as sick after snorting it as I was before the fact. To be honest with you I was never so happy to get beat because now I no longer have a source since he was my only guy and I was a loner stoner so I don't know anyone else that uses.

{"text": "What's up guys? Today I have a little over nine months clean from IV heroin. It's been a long journey since I started, and I'm finally getting it right this time around.\n I know everyone isn't a big fan of the 12step programs but AA worked for me. Since I moved to Florida completely turned my life around. This time last year I was sitting in inpatient back in the Chicago area. Now I'm working a 9-5 job in sales making over $60k annually. Instead of robbing my friends and family for money now im financing a beautiful car and living in a gated community with a pool right outside my apartment. I am 100% independent and fully self supporting. \nMy point of posting this isn't to brag. I just want to show others who are in early recovery and/or struggling to show there is hope. Im achieving my dreams. I was hopeless for so long. I lost everything. I was spiritually and financially broken, but, I turned my life around. It was hard work but I can truly say that I am grateful for this disease I have today. \nIf you are struggling please do not hesitate to reach out. \n\nOne love. \nAlex. 282 days clean.
