 post: First I want to say that I can't believe I've never been here before. I've been a Redditor for some time under various account names and an opiate *enthusiast* for going on ten years.

It only just occurred to me today to visit r/heroin, which (surprise, surprise) is a ghost town. A post there mentioned r/opiates and here I am, happy to see a small but active and caring community of like-minded and varied Redditors.

So Hi!

Separately - after having done some reading here I am fairly certain that the gear we've been getting here in Scotland is cut with Fentanyl. A slightly alien yet heavy rush, which at first seems to suggest I am in for a lengthy and perhaps dangerous nod, which then wears off quite quickly leaving a mediocre high for the remainder.

Fentanyl? Check. But here's the thing - the gear is very hard, takes a lot - I mean **a lot** of acid to break down and bubbles as a very thick, opaque mixture before settling into a combined sediment / translucent golden liquid. The more acid - the less sediment.

What is going on with this kit? Has anyone seen anything similar and maybe know what's going on here?

It's the strongest stuff we've had in years but isn't strong in the way I remember the good stuff hitting.

Thanks r/opiates. Once again, pleased to join you all.

Edit - at some point the sediment stops dissolving. I can't keep adding acid and be rid of it all.",q2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5

 post: Hi folks.

I used to subscribe to /r/opiates but recently have been finding the content too provocative while trying to stop.

Quick history : I've been messing around with heroin and bupe since about April - my most recent relapse. IV dope user for ~8 years. I became hooked mainly to the bupe this time, with occasional dope hits. It's been just over a week without bupe.

Tried to cold turkey but failed.

What I'm wondering is how long after my last dose of bupe will it be before it is again effective for a rapid opiates detox?

I've done it once before. I went from daily half teenth IV dope to nothing after a week of using gradually reduced doses of bupe. (eg Monday 8mg, Tuesday 6mg, Wednesday 6mg, Friday 4mg, Saturday 2mg, Sunday 1mg, Monday 1mg then off.)

Doing this the only suffering I felt was some insomnia, but I hadn't taken buprenorphine for about 5 months.

**TL:DR** Want to do a rapid bupe detox from dope, but only just stopped bupe habit a week ago. How long before the bupe is again effective in this capacity? I hope I was clear.

 post: Firstly, big thank you to this community for its wealth of support, guidance and experience. 

Long time reader, first time OP post (in this sub). So I've been IVing drugs since before dope. About 10 years. I know my safety / harm reduction. I FINALLY managed to stop using H and got on Subs. A few days in I started shooting them  (save time, taste, better fx, fixation etc.) and now I'm struggling to stop it. I know it's psychological and I'm as safe as can be. It's always a clear solution (or as close to clear ad possible) going in.

 Does anyone else have experience with this? Does anyone know what dangers there are with this (aside from obvious IV related dangers), based on facts or direct experience? I can't find anything much online. My eventual goal is abstinence and I know I'm just reinforcing my fixation / ritualistic behaviour. But am I in any physical danger? Can this have some side effect I'm not aware of? The experience and brotherhood in this sub have been invaluable to me over the years so thank you to all of you.

Tl;dr: IVing subutex and unaware of any dangers.

 post: So I was reading a post on the front page along the lines of ""Socially fluent people, what mistakes do you see socially awkward people making?"" and reading through the list of responses, it got me wondering. 

I am the only one in any of my groups of friends who has *our* problem (or some of us anyway). I am a chronic relapsing H addict. I spend maybe half the year in my addiction and half of it on subbies, or abstinent or whatever. It's an ongoing problem I'm working on.

As a result of the stigma, my own insecurities and the self esteem issues that come with this, I find myself isolating - staying away from people, often thinking that I will reintegrate once I have solved the problem / been clean long enough that I can confidently say that it's in the past.

My question, to the socially adept of us here, is - how do you socialize with people? How do you stay socially relevant while dealing with this problem? I find that it's just too difficult when conversation inevitably comes my way and people ask - how are you, what are you up to, how are you doing, etc. and all I have going on is my constant battle with addiction?

Even though my other friends are normal 20-30 somethings, with no particular high achievements or whatever, I find it hard being that guy. Never making progress, constantly struggling with addiction, doing meetings or contemplating rehab (again). 

Is it possible to remain a relevant part of society when I'm going in circles with this problem? They have all been supportive in the past and never made me feel like shit for it, but to still be in this position...I'm just finding myself in an ever deeper isolation. Ignoring texts and calls, avoiding social gatherings because I'm just going to be the most ""worthless"" person there.

Anyone in a similar situation manage a relatively normal social life / have non self -esteem crushing conversations?

**TL;DR - how to have a normal social life as a perpetually relapsing heroin addict?**

 post: I don't really know the rules, but possible shit post warning!

One of the things we sacrifice as users is having that satisfying morning dump. I know that, in my case, having a successful bowel movement is restricted to maybe once a week and it's rarely a simple affair. 

Today, however, my first charge of the day lined up perfectly with that feeling down below that today was the day for a smooth and successful trip to the bathroom for no 2. 

Having been at *least* a week since last taking a problem free dump, when I got home with a score bag this afternoon, as I was cooking up my hit I could tell that now was the moment to assume the porcelain throne and let nature take its course.

I sat on the toilet, needle in hand and, as if my rectum had been buttered up, my anus dilated and allowed forth several turds of majestic proportions. All the pressure in my guts dissipated with barely any effort and once the deed was done I hit up and felt the combined euphoria of a beautiful, enormous dump and the wave of heroines warm and liberating embrace flow from my chest, to my feet. The heat rebounded up into my ass and then to the top of my head and that golden brown glow settled into a tasty charge that can only come from the first hit of the day.

I don't know if any of you have had a similar experience, but in a repetitive life of stress and struggle, it's the small victories that keep me going.

A truly wonderful feeling.

 post: I feel like I need to put this out there in the hope that maybe someone can tell me it'll be okay and that there is a way out.

I am now 30. My drug use started out fun - with everybody else, but as usual they grow up, mature, move on and build a life. Mine has been varied, some jobs, some studies, some interesting things have happened - but I always let the drugs back in. Rehabs, geographicals, meetings, 12 steps...

Fast forward to now and I have been housebound for nearly two years. I spend half my time asleep and the other half of the time resisting getting high or getting high. I feel like I have abused all my local sources of help so may times that I've become the guy we won't waste our energy on. After all...stick with the winners right?

I wake up between 1 and 2pm most days, despite trying to get to bed for around midnight. Waking up feels horrible and I try to sleep away as much of the day as I can. I don't have anything to be awake for. When I do try and get up early I don't remember turning off my alarms or I sleep through them / switch them all off and hope for a few more hours of numb sleep. 

Being alive and awake feel like a chore. A pain. A challenge with no reward. The more I think about it, the more I hope I won't wake up in the morning. This is turning into suicidal fantasy.

Do I just force myself to go to meetings *again*? I can barely shower myself or cut or brush my hair. I feel like a massive failure and like I've fucked everything up in my head to the point where it'll take more energy than I have to fix.

Does suicide make me weak? I feel weak...

I'm hanging on because I'm gong to rehab in a few months (or when ever a bed becomes available), but I've been before and doubt myself so much. I don't want to wake up anymore.

In less than 3 weeks I'll be a year clean. I never imagined I'd get here and I think the main reason I have is learning through repeated recovery / relapse episodes that I truly have no control and that heroin always takes me to a much darker hell than whatever I'm trying to run from. Really believing this deep down and basically wanting to avoid pain at whatever cost has helped to solidify my Step 1 (for want of a better term).

Recovery is not what I thought it would be. The real difficulties were / are hard to push through in ways I hadn't imagined. My inability to handle, process and accept emotions is awful! When I'm going through some emotional process I feel lost and afraid because I haven't got a clue what is going on or when it will end. Every significant emotional difficulty feels like the end of the world!

&nbsp;

On the other side of that coin the moments of joy have been incredibly real and unexpected. Meeting a woman (also the source of my biggest pain), rediscovering music and pushing myself to do things I never thought I'd get to, peer support work at the centre where I got clean, service positions in NA / CA - all this in under a year. It gives me tremendous hope for what is possible in the future and I'm not even particularly healthy yet.

&nbsp;

The real shock is just how long this process is going to take. I always imagined a year to be this huge milestone where I'd have done loads of work on myself and be almost as normal as any other person in the streets. But it's passed so quickly and, if anything, I'm only discovering more ways in which I'm hurt and broken and want to recover from. I'm going to be recovering from the causes of my using and the damage done by my using, not over a course of keyrings, days and months - but years.

&nbsp;

And that's daunting. I suppose that's why it's ""Just For Today"" and I'm glad for that and the moments of real happiness, laughter and awakening of old parts of myself I thought I'd lost. They give me bouts of faith that help propel me through some of my darker moments. Those dark moments come with suicidal ideation and using thoughts - although more of the former than the latter.

&nbsp;

I'm just sharing this to see if anyone else can relate and if anyone has anything to add or share with me? Those of you who are at a similar milestone, but also those of you who have gone through this stage who can share your experience as well?

&nbsp;

I feel like I'm going through a second puberty where my emotions are wild and volatile and everything feels unknown and a little frightening. 

&nbsp;

**TL;DR - My first year of recovery has been nothing like I imagined it might be. The challenges are nothing like I expected and the pleasures have been a real surprise, but I fear the journey ahead and the scope of personal work I need to do to heal what caused my using and the damage done by my using.**",q12,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: I have been dealing with poly-substance abuse for a long-time. It has buried me emotionally. I had a good chunk of money saved but it allowed me to hide from everything. I was abusing a combo of opiates (codiene/DHC mainly), benzos or ambien, and adderall. I quit everything about a year and a half ago with the help of a detox place. I relapsed by starting to use Kratom and then ventured into RC benzos as a way to get off Kratom, but of course that spiraled into abusing both and graduating to harder opiates as well as filling my adderall script. I resigned from a contract job because I thought it would give me a chance to get clean but it only seemed to make the situation worse. I hated myself during that long time of abuse, but I tried to mask the depression and anxiety with more pills. The idea of going into another job while abusing meds just made it worse, I didn't think I would ever be able to stop and I was mentally driving myself crazy with my thoughts and turned down other job oppurtunities because of this fear. It was like I felt getting clean alone was impossible because of how I isolated myself, but also didn't want to add more pressure by getting a new job while actively using. Anyways, last Monday I stopped all benzo/adderall use and tapered down to Kratom. I thought by today I would feel relief knowing I was only on Kratom, but I am still not clean while on Kratom and have been through 2 weeks of hell already. I didn't sleep for a 4 day span, and now sleep on and off an hour at a time. My thinking is still foggy from the Kratom, but it doesn't do much in regards to anxiety. Right now I imagine that the benzo W/Ds are still most of it, but because I have put myself through so much mental anguish, I don't know if I am simply creating anxiety.

I have to start working again, but I'm not sure if I can wait till I'm off Kratom too. A part of me thinks getting on a routine would be good for me even if I have to eventually deal with Kratom W/Ds while working. It's so demoralizing knowing that you pushed so much away while using. I don't even remember all these days and nights. Quitting was always consuming my mind but I just never put together enough consecutive clean time, it was all the short attempts at tapering or trying to just stop taking one med. 

Really no point in my post, just wanted to get some things out. Curious if anyone can relate on trying to isolate yourself from everything to basically hide your using or thinking you were just trying to hide the days when you were planning on tapering or quitting. I would often cancel future plans because I didn't want to be around anyone while ""attempting"" to get clean, even though I obviousally kept abusing something in order to drown my depression. At this point it hard to feel I will ever get clean, I have been on this coaster for so long and have chronic underlying depression and social anxiety. My goal now is to just stabilize on Kratom, even though I will still obsess that I'm not clean and still have that battle to think about. If I try to quit everything at once without support then it might put me in the psych ward.",q0,2,1,1,0,5,0,0,"2,3,4",0,0

 post: I have a history of overly worrying about things to the point that it can be crippling. I quit opiates/benzos/adderall 12 days ago, now I am trying to stabilize on Kratom. I would love to stop it all but I'm living alone and not working, not having a distraction or something to normalize my routine makes withdrawal 10x's worse. I'm not sure how much Kratom helps but it has been a bad two weeks. I cycled through different opiates but was primarily taking 600mg of DHC or codeine for the past 6 months. I was also abusing benzos, I started using the RC ones you get online. For the past 4-6 weeks I was trying to go about 4-5 days before using again, but wasn't really lowering my doseages. I have been thinking about quitting for months but when I wasn't using I could barely get out of the house or accomplish anything besides laying around. Eventually I would fold if I needed to get something done.

I get so easily over-whelmed, and that feeling is really magnified when I stop dosing. I didn't sleep for a 4 day span in the past 2 weeks. I can tell Kratom is preventing the rest from hitting me, but I can't help but wonder how much of this crippling anxiety is withdrawal related and not just me stressing myself out. I quit because I need to get my life back together which is going to require me to move in order to work. It feels like my blood pressure is through the roof, it messes with my vision and I sweat non-stop. Adding benzos to my habit took it to another level. I might of tried something stupid if I tried to quit everything at once. I hate knowing that all this hardship isn't even getting me clean, I still have to eventually get off Kratom but thought it was smarter to get my affairs in order before I tackled Kratom as well.

 post: My one big disclaimer is that I was a poly-substance abuser, and I went cold turkey off a decent xanax addiction during the same time I jumped off the more powerful DHC to kratom.

Things get out of control quickly when you wake up to realize you have two monkeys on your back, the agreement I made with myself is that I will quit benzos without tapering, but I will use as much Kratom as needed to get through jumping off DHC. The last time I took DHC or Xanax was the Sunday of Labor Day. The first two weeks were absolutely brutal, I could barely function, I didn't sleep for a 4 day span, I was extremely paranoid, it truly was hell. I thought the benzo withdrawals kicked in that first week but now that I look back I think it was primarily opiate withdrawals. However, quitting two drugs at once will only magnify the withdrawal from each. On day 9 I felt some relief, I thought I made it through the worst, however by the Thursday evening of the 2nd week I could feel the benzo withdrawals getting harder and harder to predict, they definitely peaked at the end of week 2. I even bought at-home drug tests to try and see if benzos were still in my urine, it didn't show negative until Thursday of week 3. At the end of week 2 I probably could have picked myself up and been somewhat productive, however you really start to crave sobriety and I knew the Kratom was dulling lots of emotions still. After week two I ordered some plain Bali and stem n vein. That Tuesday it came in and I had a few doses of Bali but then switched to stem n vein that evening. Sure enough after a few hours from the S&V dose I started to feel that unbearable anxiety creeping in. It's such a heart-wrenching feeling after being bed ridden and completely unproductive for two weeks. A part of you tries to tell you just to stabilize on Kratom, get back into society, and once you start to get things on track then work on getting off Kratom. It's a similar mentality to someone using suboxone to get off heroin, but suboxone users commonly end up hating being on suboxone because the withdrawals from that are really no more easy than heroin, Kratom is very similar. Anyways, I took the last 5g dose of Bali on Wednesday morning at 4-5am. I took one more S&V 5g dose on Wednesday around 11am. The stem & vein didn't really provide relief, although I'm sure it helps a bit. I will say that I avoided many common opiate withdrawal symptoms this time around, no unbearable RLS, no violent sneezing or yawning Iat least not yet). It's mainly been extreme insomnia, anxiety, currently low grade depression that I know will increase in PAWs. The worst thing about it is that I have already been through so much that I am desperate to feel like I am close to at least feeling stable. It's been about 48 hours since last Kratom dose, I'm on day 20 I believe from last DHC/Xanax dose. My sleeping is extremely disturbed, I somehow got on this schedule in which I can seem to even find some comfort until 9-11am, but when I do sleep the sweat comes pouring out and I wake up feeling pretty bad. You can't really tell how much sleep you actually got because you constantly wake up. What bothers me now is that I have been glued to my apartment for so long that I am paranoid of leaving. My place is trashed, I need to do tons of laundry, I need to clean, I need to go get food, and I really need to get serious about work. I honestly thought I would be better off at day 20, but it's really hard to gauge a detox when you were abusing multiple substances for multiple years. A lot of that anxiety I feel is likely self-afflicted. I just want to wake up from one of these short naps with this sudden urge to want to get back out in society. I know relapsing would crush my confidence, so I am still willing to ride this out longer hoping I see a beam of light. These subs have really helped as I don't have much of an outlet otherwise.

 post: Sorry for the length, it just helps getting all this out.

Many know I have been dealing with a tough addiction and recent withdrawal. I was on a large benzo/opiate habit and got off both 3 weeks to the day. The withdrawal was really intense, I was stuck to my apartment for almost the entire 3 weeks. I really hoped I would feel some type of restored confidence to then jump off the Kratom, but I don't know if I am so bruised mentally that the thought of going through more scares the crap out of me and just amplify my current after shock withdrawal symptoms like sleep. 

Once I started to feel stabilized on Kratom it's like my mind went back to when I was at this point before. About 14 months ago I got out of in-patient rehab. I was working a heavy contract at the time so I used all my 2.5 weeks of vacation to at least attempt the detox even though I knew 28 days was the minimum stay they really prefer. I had a feeling I might be pushing it, but I figured 2.5 weeks of rehab would be more effective. 

I worked 6 12 hour days, and it was mental type work. When I got back from rehab I wasn't physically or mentally well, and when my sleep wasn't recovered that job started killing me. I actually ended up just quitting, I was kinda in this frantic state and was so afraid on continuing to relapse that I just quit. This didn't really help anything, I just felt that without the pressure that I would start sleeping better and things would look up. Unfortunately, even though I eliminated one pressure, it's not like I felt free. I knew I needed to find another job but now I was suffering in recovery and the thought of interviewing and having the motivation it requires for one to start a new job and impress your new employer seemed almost more daunting than just trying to grit and bear the job you just had. I knew I wasn't thinking clearly, I knew I was so exhausted from all these changes, and being in the PAWS stage just made it worse.

 Then my gf of 8 years had enough and moved. I knew once she left it was going to break me and I relapsed back into addiction but using Kratom instead. Kratom was the less-evil brother, and I managed to get back into the gym and even was going out with friends on the weekends while using Kratom. I still had hesitations about making big job decisions because I knew I was still under the influence of something and once I started a new job that I likely wouldn't find the time to quit for awhile. Sure enough I took a new job that allowed me to work from home and I gradually started to mess with more powerful opiates and even the benzos. That was just a temporary contract, when I was done with it I spent weeks diving deeper into addiction until a few weeks ago when I decided that it was out of control and started the process of getting off benzos and opiates.

 Now after 3 weeks I am back in that place I was months ago. Sometimes I think a work routine, being around co-workers, etc will be good to establish before jumping off all the way. Basically use Kratom like suboxone. Sometimes I feel like I should just white knuckle another week of trying to go ct and see how I feel. I know rehab would be my best option but I'm starting to run low on cash, my insurance won't pay for crap. I am starting to feel really desperate.

I know there isn't an easy answer and I probably sound kinda frantic. Sometimes I just need to type all this out.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"0,5",0,2,0,0

So many many many great things! I'm not saying you all need to stop! (Well, that would be the shit) but I wholly accept I have no control over what you all end up doing. Just know the life after addiction waiting for you is far far far beyond greater than any drug high. You are special. And you deserve inner peace. I love all of you. And you will be in my thoughts. I just wanted to express this to you guys because I don't know who this will help but even if it's just one person, than I am ever grateful. So again, love you all. Goodnight.

This in general is a major contributor to the way recreational users are viewed by society. The people with jobs and normal lives who use responsibly (statistically 80-90% of all illegal drug users) can't be open about what they do because they'd be fired and ostracized by the community. So unfortunately the only drug users people are exposed to are the addicts and the irresponsible. This is also true in the media. A normal person with a good job who uses an illegal drug now and again isn't a news story. What all this adds up to is an incorrect perception that the only people who use drugs are addicts with fucked up lives because for the average person, that's the only drug user they've been made aware of. It's really unfortunate because it creates discrimination towards the vast majority because of a small minority that sets the bad example.

 post: I have been on prescribed opiates for over 10 yes due to severe pain (200 mg a day). My partner just got relocated to hawaii, and I decided to come with her. I did not expect not to be able to find a doctor to even see me let alone prescribe me the medicine I think I need. In two days, I will be completely out of meds. I have tried to get into detox. There is a wait list a mile long. I am not going to look for this shit on the street. What can I do to make it thru detox without killing myself (or really wanting to).
**Edit: saw a psychiatrist today. He did not seem concerned about the benzos wd. Wouldn't give me anything to help. He also wouldn't put me on. Suboxone bc I have legit pain, and it cant be used for people who have pain management problems. He told me I should have never come here, but too late for that. He told me to call my insurance company bc they're responsible for my care. More time wasted. I am in the thick of wd. I can't do this**
** EDIT 2 yay!! Day three without opiates or xanax!  I want to thank everyone who sent me a private message. Honestly, I couldn't do it without you guys. I have been to a couple of meeting.

You may also want to try sleeping sitting up.  The only time I slept in the first 10 days of my detox was in a plastic chair in a brightly lit hallway at the rehab I was at.  I managed to sleep for an hour and a half.

There was no color to my eyes left - just black saucers. My vision became so blurry that I was virtually blind - I could only identify people by their voices, not their faces.  I was seeing and hearing things that weren't there.  It was absolute hell.  There were times where I would be laying in the hallway, vomiting on myself, unable to even stand.

The rehab I attended did not provide methadone, suboxone, clonidine (except in an emergency situation where someone;s blood pressure was at dangerous levels), or benzos (except to alcoholics).  I am so thankful that they gave me nothing.  The only thing they were willing to give was sleeping medication.  I took 150MG of seroquel around day 4 and it did nothing but make me more sick so I didn't take it again.  Most of the people I was in treatment with that I still have contact with are now dependent upon seroquel to sleep every night.

My point is: you can deal.  You can get through this.  I kept telling myself that I was a warrior.

Just terrible anxiety. Went to the psychiatrist last week. He said something pretty dangerous to me. He said I never had a drug problem and was not an addict. I was very frank about my usage with him. He was supposed to do my med management for pain stuff (until I get into pain management).  totally forgot to even bring that up bc I was completely shocked and worried about his competency. He said I have severe PTSD.  Childhood trauma. Blah, blah. He prescribed he .5mg of resperidol at bedtime. I took it last night and it made me feel high as a kite. Don't think I'll be taking that ever again. I wanted to say ty for all of the private messages and support. I couldn't do it without u guys. I know I have a long way to go.

I believe this is part of why the fellowship in NA etc can serve a similar purpose. If we know someone cares about and maybe even has a stake in our staying clean it adds a layer of accountability we don't necessarily have if we are just doing something for ourselves. That's my opinion.

 post: Fuck, how the fuck did this happen?  Crazy to think 9 months ago I was in a hospital bed, could barely walk and breathe, was doing the “undercover ninja” every night to try and get comfortable to sleep, and had no direction or positive things in my life.

I can’t believe all the shit I’ve been able to accomplish in nine months...

**I’ve gotten two jobs (one of which was my dream job of teaching).**

**I’ve moved out of my parents house into my own place.**

**I have a girlfriend and am in an actual healthy relationship for the first time in my life.**

**I lost 60 lbs of body fat, stopped all blood pressure meds, max bench: 375 squat:395 dead: 455 overhead:225.**

**I love myself and actually have some sort of self esteem.**

**My relationship with my family is the best it’s ever been.**

**I actually pay bills now and manage money.**


There have been bad things too, seeing friends die from overdosing, hearing people I met in rehab have relapsed and are living on the street, and just dealing with life.  But I’m able to deal and cope with it without loading up a shot of heroin to just push those feelings away for a few hours.

If I can do it any of you can.  Do what works for you.  My recovery won’t work for you, like your’s won’t work for me.

Keep grinding every day for me just seems to get better and better!

 post: I’m officially one year clean from opiates.

Probably the biggest accomplishment of my life to say the least.


I was in a hospital a year ago, manipulating a doctor to give a heroin addict more morphine.  I had Staff and Pneumonia, but was still making plans to pick up again on Christmas 2016.

I’m now a teacher.  Work out every day.  Support myself.  And am actually happy.

It's day 3 off of a 8 day relapse. Came clean to everyone I know (all very supportive) Been a closet oxy user for years... had some good clean time before lapsing the last 8 days prior to Saturday. 60-100mg habit, 1.75 year habit with some clean time mixed in. My last pill connect entered rehab last week. All ties are cut and I'm moving forward in my life. Too much ahead of me this year to have those pills looming over me.

 post: I said I wasn't going to post today and wait for tomorrow when I'll be working on a week but I feel like I need to.

Yesterday had some high points and VERY low points that have continued into this morning. I did force myself to make my workout yesterday evening despite feeling pretty bad. The evening was fine following that until the later part of the night. I don't think I slept but 30-45 mins last night. This morning I feel like a walking emotional zombie at work. Shed a lot of tears this morning and felt pretty pathetic. I'm hoping the day gets better as it goes. Physically, most of everything has passed. I'm just in one of those dull moments where I'm struggling to find some joy and feelings outside of sadness. 

I wish I could harness some of the good from yesterday and bring it back. I don't know... it's just been a tough 12 hour stretch. I have accomplished quite a bit over days 1-5, I can't forget about that. Those are days I don't have to relive, today has been the hardest thus far. Weird. 

Have a great day everyone. TGIF right? I wish I could actually take joy in having the next 2 days off. Maybe it will pop up later.

 post: 

Seen a lot of day 1-3s recently. I'm wrapping up day 11 in a few hours and figured I'd spew some shit out about progress that might help someone.

I still cry like a baby sometimes but less frequently. I still blow up the bathroom in the morning but it doesn't persist all day. I still can't sleep well but I'm grabbing more random spurts of it. I still feel emotionally flatlined but I've caught myself laughing a few times this week and joking with others. I'm still anxious as fuck for parts of the day but I find my body TRYING to relax in the evening. I still don't feel like dealing with the outside world after work but I'm entertaining the idea of old interests. I still have the ""fuck me"" malaise but random spurts of energy come around every so often.

I'm still a lot of things that fuckin suck... BUT I'm noticing glimmers. Sometimes they come and go in an instant, sometimes they stick around a few minutes, sometimes I can stretch them for 1-2 hours. Piece by piece, glimmer by glimmer, I'm working to rebuild. 

Is it easy work? Fuck no... I've been forcing my ass in the gym (sometimes having my partner force me), following a strict diet, working on breathing techniques and yoga stretches at night, looking within myself to identify why shit is happening, making a list of small daily objectives, talking and crying to my wife, manically spitting bullshit on here, messaging with others for support (thank you, you know who you are) and all sorts of other shit that I'm forgetting. 

Did I / Do I feel like doing any of it in the moment? Hell no. I didn't ""feel like"" becoming an addict either... Now I'm focusing my effort on healing instead of harm, strength instead of weakness, mindfulness instead of numbness... today instead of tomorrow. Sounds cliche as fuck, but if you don't hammer nails into your addictions coffin on a daily basis, that fuckin zombie is going to come out and eat your fucking guts. It was scary and still is... but it's the end of a shitty chapter in my life. 

I wish I could be saying all of this with a clearer head and more time under my belt... I feel like the wisdom doesn't mean as much coming from only 11 days. Nevertheless I haven't worked this hard for something in the last 2 years except finding pills. Now the work comes with a reward instead of a temporary numbing of everything around me.

 post: Ugghhhh. Day 14 will sound much cooler on Sunday morning and I'll probably plan to type up some deeper shit then. 

Got around 5 hours of sleep again last night. I did feel the wrath of a huge ass spinach salad I ate before bed last night earlier this morning. Phew. That's the worst the GI has been since day 6-7. 

It's been a long work week, still have a full day today and tomorrow. Mornings tend to suck exponentially worse than mid-day. I'm not as scared of the evenings, I'm still a little restless but 2 unisom and a melatonin about 15 mins before bed has helped me ease off the last few nights. Instead of getting up after 3 hours at 4AM and being wide awake and pissed, I'm getting up at 5am and sorta relaxing/nodding for another 1.5 hrs. 

I have taken care of a lot of bullshit I've been putting off for months over the last 12 days, pretty stoked about that. I think I feel my brain and body re-igniting my flame for working out too. Little shit I guess... 

I get these random flashes of old feelings that shoot through me for a few seconds-minutes. I try to slow down in those moments to actually feel some shit. Only had 1-2 emotional spells that came and went yesterday. So far... none this morning, just kinda dragging a bit. 

I typed some shit yesterday about progress and the work I've been trying to put in. I know it sounds ""impossible"" and discouraging to some but it's just being honest. This shit isn't easy... but that shouldn't be the reason you don't stop using. It's not supposed to be easy, you're trying to rescue your hijacked brain and body from something that's held it hostage for however long. The effort you put in is just that... EFFORT. The more effort you put in, the more manageable you're gonna make the symptoms and obstacles.

 post: Coming up on two weeks later today. I feel like I can remember every second that's passed by. 

Good - Don't feel like last week. Getting a lot of exercise. Haven't missed a day of work. Sleep is trying to return slowly. Not as many emotional spells. Appetite is coming back (especially after exercise). Getting a lot of shit taken care of. Saving money. 

Weird - I don't want to use BAD here because things are improving from all angles, I also don't want to make it seem like a rose garden. So... I'm still having gnarly morning GI that tapers off. Still can't totally relax without some restless feet. Lingering anhedonia that comes in waves. Still sorta anxious about the feeling of not enjoying day to day life things that I used to. Sleep is still hit or miss, starting to hit more. Still dreading the length of days in the morning and how I'm going to keep my self occupied without being able to relax as easy. (That's the shit I hate the most). 

I was talking to someone last night about how most of us do enough research to have PhDs in this shit. Sometimes I wish I had a simple tracked mind that didn't try to identify all the bullshit that takes place. Fuck it though... about to go cook my wife and I breakfast, have a good cup of coffee, hit up the gym and play it by ear for the weekend.

This past weekend was better than the last. Got a lot of exercise in, bunch of stuff done around the house, went to an early dinner with my wife, cooked for the week and just hung out with some friends. Nothing crazy, I still didn't feel amazing or super peppy but I was able to function and get around to do shit. 

Not sure if I've ever experienced the ""pink cloud"" before. Maybe I think about shit too much. Nothing has felt very pink or cloud-like thus far.

Today I feel... decent? It feels like my body is trying to act normal and my brain is just a few steps behind. Sort of feels like I'm a more functional shell of myself... in a good way.

Slept a straight 7 hours last night. Two morning GI episodes. Only really annoying thing left from the physical side is clammy hands, feet, pits. Probably from the underlying anxiety, so I doubt any antiperspirant is going to tackle it. Def wish I could get that to settle down a bit.

Mentally... still sorta foggy and unable to really relax but I'm not nearly as emotional. Not a lot of happy, not a lot of sad... waves of both throughout the day that come and go. 

Hoping the work day passes quickly, looking forward to working out today so I have an excuse for sweaty pits! Haha.

 post: Yesterday started out pretty well. I dealt with the typical morning bullshit that subsided and went about my day as normal as possible, whatever that means. 

With about an hour left at work I get two messages. 

The first one was my gym partner cancelling on me, which was pretty deflating. 

The next message was my old connect (and long time friend) telling me that he had a slip up and has been off and on over the past week. I can say that I have never had a craving in the 17 days up until that point. It hit me like a fuckin sack of bricks... started pouring sweat, plotting and rationalizing all the ways I could get around this security blanket that I've created, giving myself reasons as to why it would be okay, the whole nine. In the moment it felt like I went all the way back to day 2, looking for an escape from the torture that was day 1-4. Oh yea... it was payday yesterday as well. 

I immediately got up with one of my biggest supporters, played the tape of days 1-7, took some deep breaths (maybe smoked a bit of weed) and went on a jog with my dog. It took about an hour or so for me to counteract my rat brain coming to the realization that it's just not possible anymore. I can't fuckin do it. Eventually I replied to him with the supportive route and asked him what his plan was to get a handle on himself again, we ended up having a good talk and left it at that.

I still feel a bit off this morning but nothing like I did for that hour or two yesterday. Managed 5-6 hours of sleep after a good meal late in the evening. I have a small headache still (I think from the two sides of my brain battling it out), lingering anxiety and just feel over revved. I cannot wait to get in the fucking gym later on, need to get some of this tension out physically. 

Other than that rant, I'm moving forward. Got all the bills paid for the month yesterday, cooked a good ""breakfast for dinner"" and watched Bill Burrs new special on Netflix. Turns out all that inner turmoil was for nothing, the evening wasn't bad at all.

Just hoping that I get more ""happy"" waves this weekend so I can continue seeing mental progress.

Still some morning GI stuff. Clams come and go. Energy/happiness comes in more spurts with less feelings of gloom and doom. I feel like I'm trying to slowly step back into the shell of my old self that I've been hovering outside of for the last year. 

Side note... it's nice having a decent chunk of leftover money after payday. Went a little heavy on Amazon yesterday as a treat to myself, still doesn't compare to the pill money. Funny how my frugality instantly kicks back in when pills aren't in the budget. 

Have a good day folks. ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"17,0,11",0,0,0,0

 post: TGIF

Yesterday was okay minus a crazy afternoon episode of the sweats. I fuckin hate that feeling. Worked, grocery shopped, hit the gym, made a big dinner, started filing taxes. 

Last night/this morning have not been the greatest. Broken sleep from 930-430, emotions are a little haywire this AM, not very enthusiastic feeling so far. Not sure why... hoping it passes over soon. 

Lingering symptoms are still morning GI/Restless when I try to relax/anxiety sweats. Other than that it's a mental game at this point. 

I'm starting an adaptogen blend on top my other shit I take today. Anyone have experience with adaptogens? After a lot of research I've found that people use them for clean energy and lowering inflammation in the brain/body, therefore lowering anxiety and depression spells. Worth a shot I guess... 

Hoping today goes by quick so at least I don't have to deal with work for 2 days. Hoping I can get some solid sleep and ""relax"" time this weekend. Almost 3 weeks!

Who enjoys waking up at 5AM on a Saturday? Not this guy! Fuck it though... 

Yesterday pretty much sucked for the most part. It's a new day though... so I tried some new shit this morning... guided meditation while the sun was coming up. After about 10 minutes of following these Australian guide's instructions I really had to shit... so that was the end of that attempt. I'll try again tomorrow before any coffee.

Started the morning walking the dog in 20 degree weather so my wife could get extra sleep. Doing some dishes and laundry now, about to cook breakfast because I hear her stirring around on the other end of the house. 

Today's agenda doesn't contain much more than a haircut, workout and hopefully trying a new Mongolian Grill... mmm.

Symptoms at 3 weeks out... broken sleep of 4-6 hours, morning shits (a very zen one this morning at least), anhedonia waves, come and go restless limbs. 

Hoping some of the above starts to clear out over the next week.

 post: Morning everyone. Another glorious Monday morning, right? Still fuckin hate Mondays...

This weekend was a mixed bag of awesome and shitty. Friday night until Sunday morning was great! Ran lots of errands, got in some solid workouts, freshened the hair/beard up, had a fun dinner date with the wife. I started to think I was coming out of the fog for a bit. 

Sunday morning the fog rolled back in. Emotional, tons of GI issues, anxiety sweats, depressed, stir crazy, irritable, restless. Felt like day 4 of withdrawals out of the blue. It faded a bit going into the Super Bowl last night but I only managed 4.5 hours of sleep. Just goes to show you the unpredictable nature of this process. 

Nevertheless, I weathered the storm and I'm looking at a fresh week 4 ahead of me. A lot of shit I read/hear says that this should be the week of a lot of symptoms starting to subside. It's a mixed bag of horror stories and glory stories when it comes to week 4. 

Either way... this is officially the longest clean streak in a year of my 2 year run with opiates. Proud of that. Here's to hoping this week shows more reprieve!

Only things lingering around at 25 days are morning GI, restless sleep, anxiety/anhedonia waves. I think it's gradually getting better but it feels sort of consistent over the last few days.

In a sluggish mental fog at the moment with that weighing on my mind, coupled with little sleep and no energy. I feel like I traded one good day for one swift kick in the nuts.

Yesterday was a great day at work and at home. Productive, great workout, good dinner and movie with the wife. I started thinking about today before I laid down last night and now it's transitioned into anxiety and lethargy this morning.

The last 2-3 days have been rough out of the blue. My body/brain are feeling anxious, depressed and just out of sync compared to 27-30. Almost feels like days 7-11 again.

This weekend was amazing... went hiking, fishing, shooting, watched some good movies, made big dinners and just overall had a good early Valentines with the wife.

I've been posting comments here for about a year now and I can genuinely say that this is one of my favorite subreddits. Everyone here is just so helpful and nice to each other. It's just wonderful. If someone is in a really bad mood or suffering from depression I see you guys offer guidance and most importantly friendship, someone to talk to. I've always been a bit of a shy person, but I feel I can completely and 100% be myself here with no judgement. I'm not sure how many people are in the same boat as me but I take opiates everyday now, normally oxycodone with hydrocodone and I am honestly completely happy with my life, I don't steal, or lie to get my drugs, I earn an honest living working as a assistant marine biologist as a local aquarium and I'm proud of the lifestyle I live now. Of course opiates aren't for everyone and they can ruin some people's lives. But this sub has taught me that being an opiate addict isn't always a death sentence, it's a lifestyle choice and some of us are completely happy with our lives :)




Sorry of this is a bit of a ramble but I really wanted to show my appreciate to everyone here, your stories and pictures have given me many laughs and helped me through many hard times.


I would also like to give a shout out to a couple users on here who I see CONSTANTLY helping others and just all around improving this subreddit; /u/fat_loser_junkie        /u/heroinking    /u/Orange_Uncle_Monkey   /u/OxyJay   /u/Peer_Pressure-er

Anyways i keep at least 40 pounds of poppyseeds for emergencies so i haven't gone through any withdrawals in a very long time (been abusing opiates for about 5 years now), i tend to drink about 2-3 pounds a day and i estimate I get about 80-150mg of morphine from that amount (I wash each batch of seeds 4 times to get every bitnof morphine i can) I always see people posting about withdrawals and i wonder why more of y'all dont keep seeds stocked just in case? They are cheap, legal, and its very easy to get morphine from them, doesn't even take 10 minutes.

Im feeling really up and talkative today so i wanted to post something. If anyone has questions about poppy seed tea, the best methods to use, or websites where you can LEGALLY order it let me know. Just because we're addicts doesn't mean we need to go through withdrawals. I hope all of you have a happy, healthy, and safe day. Be careful out there.

I'm a full time assistant biologist, and to be honest I fucking love my life, shit gets better for me everyday, all while supporting my habit, my friends and family don't really mind since I'm not fucking up. 

.


Anyways, at anytime I keep at least 40 pounds of poppyseeds incase the site I order from gets shut down, or something gets lost in the male, by doing this, I haven't WD'd in close to 2 years, I plan out my daily usage in a planner as to not use too much and raise my tolerance more than needed. 



But, this time I fucked up. As I finish off a bag of poppyseeds, I go to check my emergency supply and find out I only have FIVE POUNDS LEFT! Which is maybe 5 days worth of tea if I really stretch it and taper down. My next shipment wasn't supposed to arrive until 2 weeks later. I'm thinking ""what the fuck am I going to do?? I'm so close to running out and I've got to teach an entire auditorium full of students about ocean/life/recycling, which I simply cannot do in WD. I was a nervous wreck. The day I ran out I called in sick, since it had been so long since I'd experienced WD I was in absolutel agony, I literally layed in the shower crying for like 12 hours, every inch of my body hurt, migraines, sweating like a dog even though my condo was 62 degrees, throwing up, I was so tired but couldn't even lay on my bed because the RLS would start up instantly. I know this makes me sound like a pussy but I was this close to killing myself. Everything in life went from perfect to absolute hell in 24 hours, I love my life, but every second felt like an hour, it felt like I was crouched in that shower for weeks.


.
Desperately I pull my self out of the shower and search my entire house for poppyseeds, and old OXY, ANYTHING, and what did I find??

.
Well first I found a bottle of 20 5mg hydros I didn't know I had. I ate all 20 in the span of 5 minutes (RIP liver), but I'm sure you folks understand that level of desperation. But that's  not much, obviously, but when I found it I cried with relief. About a hour later I found my 40 pounds of poppyseeds under my fucking bed! I hid it there when I cleaned my closet!!! I felt so ducking stupid! I put myself through horrible depressing agony for no reason I could have lost my job if I missed more days!


.
To top things off, the next day I got an early shipment of  20lbs of poppyseeds I didn't expect, so now I've got like 55 pounds or so...wow...I'm so stupid sometimes. I've experienced WD countless times but this time was so much worse because of what I had to lose, and because it had been so long since I experienced WD because of my planning ahead. Just thought you guys might think this was funny/interesting. I usually never have good WD/junkie Jesus stories so I wanted to share.

 post: Good morning everyone, as poppyseed tea is getting more and more popular, I've been receiving more and more requests on what sites I recommend. For the last 3 years I've recommended Poppyseedtom.com to likely over a thousand users on this sub who have messaged me. Poppyseedtom.com has been sold to a large ""natural"" food company affiliated with the Pitney Bowes service and their quality had continuously dropped over the last 6 months. As many of us know, poppy seed tea requires UNWASHED poppyseeds. The last 6 shipments I have received have been washed, despite numerous claims on their website (which is rarely updated now). In addition to being washed and useless for tea, the last 3 shipments I've gotten (20lbs Amsterdam strain, 20lbs afghan strain, 20lbs Spanish blue strain) have all been tainted with something and have made both me and people close to me very ill. My sister even had to go to the hospital for whatever it was. All of us are okay now, but the sickness lasted about a week and included symptoms like incredibly high fever, delirium, really bad and burning shits, and general lethargicness. None of us were WDing during this period, and we all got sick from these last shipments. I also had a user whom I do not know message me saying they experienced similar symptoms from their last order of poppy seeds from PoppySeedToms. 


.


This is a company many of us here have trusted and used for many years, but it appears to no longer be safe, or even a good source of seeds. I highly recommend that no one uses this website anymore as it is no longer safe, or even owned by the same people.  I have since found 3 other sites with seeds that seem to be perfectly fine, and if you PM, I can provide links later on tonight. 

.

TLDR: Poppyseedtom.com has been bought out again, and their products appear to NOT be safe, I recommend not using them, and exercising extreme caution if you do use them. 

I want us all to be safe and healthy.

 post: I've been using opiates for about 6 or 7 years now, and I've used daily for the last 5 YEARS(not days) . In all this time I've never had any issue with sex drive, libido, or shitting. So I've always been very thankful for that.
 
Now, obviously I know it's very common to experience sexual problems while on opiates. I just find it strange it's only effecting me *now*...

But, the last 2 weeks shit hasn't been great.

I'm a very sexually active person and I've been experiencing some issues. I have a friend named Gia, we grew up together and I've known her my entire life. We have an interesting relationship, but typically we have sex at least  2-3 times a week.

But, these last two weeks, I'm having fun with Gia and after only 10-15 minutes of sex I just go soft. I'm still very turned on, and want to continue, but I simply cannot because I'm limp. It was humiliating. She didn't even get off (she typically cums very easily) and neither did I. This has never happened for either of us. Usually I last a long time, stay hard until we're finished. I just assumed it was a fluke because I hard worked really hard that day. So I kinda shrugged it off.




2 days later we tried again, the exact same thing happened. So she gave me a handjob to try and help. I did actually cum from the handjob, *but* I still didn't get hard. Never in my life have I had an orgasm without being hard, so that was also strange and disheartening for me. 




To try to remedy this issue I completely stopped masturbating, the only time I'm getting off now is during sex. That *did* help to an extent, I'm no longer having an issue staying hard. But now I'm simply cumming too early. I'm lucky if I even go 10 minutes before I cum right now, it's a bad case of premature ejac apparently...




This whole thing is really messing with my head, my confidence, and just my sex drive in general, it's very embarrassing. I've always thought I was really good at sex, but now my dick isn't exactly responding how id like it to.

I feel guilty because Gia thinks it may be because I'm not attracted to her anymore. I told her that that couldn't be farther from the truth, that she's as beautiful as ever, and that it's likely the opiates causing this issue.



Of course I always knew this was a possibility with opiate use, but I didn't expect it because it's never happened before, even after years of opiate use with a hefty tolerance.


This sub had helped me with countless issues, and given me superb advice over the last 4 years, so I just wanted to see if anyone could offer me some advice, or possibly provide insight if you've experienced something similar. There's a lot of very intelligent people here, and I mean that.

Do I need Viagra? What can I do besides quitting opiates (because that sure as fuck isn't happening?

 post: Good morning everyone, I've got like 30 minutes before I have to give a lecture about The Gulf of Mexico/pollution for an elementary school, so I thought I'd start up a post.


.

Now, all of us, whether you're a new addict, or you've been using for decades, know that withdrawal is a horrible horrible painful thing. Probably the worst part of any addiction. Yet as much as we hate it, it's important to be prepared.

.

I've seen people post their WD kits before. So what's in yours?
I'll go first:



.


My WD kit is an old Jurassic Park lunch box. Contained within are some thing to either get rid of, or help ease WD symptoms.


First of all I've got some downers. 6 xanax, 10 k-pins, 2 old ass Valium. The worst part of WD to me is not being able to sleep, and the dreaded RLS. Benzos/barbs seem to be the only thing that can help me sleep while in WD (besides actual opiates, obviously).


.

Next, I've got 80 Kratom extract capsules. This stuff works great, takes away 90% of WD symptoms for me, but I have to take like 12 or more to have these effects. Good stuff.

.

I've always got a bottle of lope. Apparently it works great for some people. It's never worked for me, even in massive doses of 200mg or more. But I keep it just in case, I guess. 

.

After that I've got 5 8mg suboxone strips. Maybe this one is cheating because it's an opioid. But I really love subs. They completely take away my opiate WD 100%, and if I take more than 10mg I even get high and start to nod. I would actually take these recreationally, but I never see them anymore, so they are too pricey. An essential part of a WD kit though IMO!


.

Next I've got a little pull bottle with about 12 5mg hydrocodones, and like 10 codeine of several different MG. shits too weak to get high off of, but definitely will help my WD's. These pills are like 3 years old lol.


.

I've got like 3 pre rolled joints with some really great medical pot, but I'm sure they're pretty dry since they've been in this box for over a year. Honestly pot tends to make my WD worse...but it's nice to have if I need it.


.

I've got a few bath bombs, I love soaking in the tub to try to relax my nerves when in WD. I also keep like $60 in here so I can treat myself with candy, a movie, whatever.


.


Well, that's pretty much it! This box is a lifesaver, seriously. I don't WD often because I keep like 80 pounds of poppy seeds under my bed. But when I do WD, I WD badly because of my tolerance. If I didn't have this box, I probably would have been close to losing my job a few times....




.


So again, what's in your WD kit/box? Am I missing something that you'd recommend? Thoughts? 



.


Thanks for listening, and being a great community that I am proud to be part of, and see grow over the last 4 years. I apologize for my horrible formatting ""skills"".

.

I've got some old school systems, n64, ps1, ps2, Snes, etc for when I need a dose of nostalgia (Hotwheels racing anyone...?) I also have an original 1982 Miss PACMAN arcade cabinet that my father gave me once I graduated college. None of you fuckers will EVER beat me at miss PACMAN, I'll tell you that right now! :)

.

Ive got some newer systems, WiiU for Mario Kart and smash brothers. 3DS XL for animal crossing, and such.

.

But I JUST ordered a ps4 on Amazon today. I'm super pumped because it's a limited edition Destiny ps4. I've never even played that game, but I loved the look of the console. Here's a link:

Isn't that great?? I'm so excited for it to get here! I got an order from Darknet too so I'll be waiting for the FedEx dude like crazy.

.

Any recommendations for the ps4 or WiiU? I've already got GTA5 coming from eBay, but I need more ideas.


.


Oh! Also, how could I forget? MOTHER FUCKING RUNESCAPE! I've been playing on the same account on Runescape for over 12 years now. Everyone else stopped playing in 5th grade, but I never really did. I swear, that game is my first real experience with addiction.

I've tried to quit 5 times in the last year or so. Start a program, leave the program. Get through detox, feel great and then ""just for the weekend"" myself back into active addiction. 
I've cut myself off my main supply by requesting my mother stop refilling her meds (she doesn't actually take them - I simply con her out of them) this time around. Last time I told my friend that I was going to rehab, and she won't sell me her pills anymore. So, now I'd have to really dig deep to get pills. I'm praying that I don't. 
I bought some Kratom, and have some muscle relaxers for the withdrawl I may experience. But, truth be told - my withdrawl isn't anywhere near what I've seen in others. Bone pain and exhaustion is about it.

I called my sponsor and prepared my, ""I'll just take ibuprofen"" speech for the dentist, but I'm a fucking wreck. I've got 4 months clean and sober - the idea of being in pain just riles me up.

 post: Wanted to share how it went. I know I sounded like a big baby who doesn't know how to adult. I know it seemed like I was preparing myself for a relapse. But, can I share the miracle that has happened to me in recovery? 

I've always been a very prideful person. I Never accepted help from people. I was one of those strong-willed people who believed I could power through anything on my own. For the most part, that approach has worked for me my entire life. I've dedicated myself to being a ""strong, independent woman"" who can overcome anything once I put my mind to it. I kicked a 4 year IV meth habit. I went from being a junkie to being a contributing member of society, with a great family and career. By all accounts I was a party girl, who held down the fort. 

This opiate habit struck me like a cancer. Suddenly I was very sick and I tried for over a year to pull myself up by the boot straps.  I was weak and helpless and insecure. So when it came time to finally get better - having 4 months clean and facing the dentist I'd put off purposely to avoid the opportunity to use pain meds, I was terrified. I was terrified and excited and all of the feelings. 

I reached out. I reached out here, I reached out to my sponsor, I reached out to my home group and my family. I made a very big deal out of this appointment, which I discovered was simply my addiction rearing its head. I have dental anxiety on a good day. I can simply walk near a dental chair and have a panic attack. It's just my fear. 

through all the support I sought out, o faced the procedure with instructions to provide me only with ibuprofen after and I felt good about it. The procedure turned for the worst. It was clear that I may actually need those meds and so I instructed my daughter to inform the dentist that I could have only 10 pills and I gave them to my husband. 

Well, I didn't take one. I took the ibuprofen, and I relaxed and I got through the worst of it so far. I'm not obsessed with those pills right now. I feel like, ""this is not going to be the reason I relapse."" It's all because of the support, the planning and preparation. 

I wanted to thank all of you who responded to my previous post and encourage anyone who may read this another day. We can do it, and it's not shameful to be afraid and work through that fear with others. ",q12,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gddmmom,OpiatesRecovery,8o0sp1,6/2/2018 10:13,0,2,"title: Pain Meds were necessary - thoughts? .
 post: So since I've been sober, my shoulder had hurt pretty bad every day. I've dealt with it with ice and NSAIDs, chiropractic care, acupuncture and massage. It got really bad, to where I couldn't even write in my 12-step book without excessive pain so I went to the orthopedist. My GP had said it was tendonitis and it would heal, but it's been about 6-8 months of pain, and about a month of extreme pain so I figured with all this clean time, I'd be safe to risk the need for surgery. 

The great news is it's calcific tendonitis, which should be mostly treatable with physical therapy and surgery will be a last resort. 

The bad news is I gave in and took pain meds three times in the last week or so. I'm not sure why, but as soon as I knew I really had a physical problem, as evidenced by imaging - I allowed myself some relief. My husband has the pills stashed, there were only 16 5mg Percocet given to me and I've only taken 6, total. (2 at a time) Never took them during the day, never got loaded at that dose and yet I still feel disappointed in myself. 

They gave me a cortisone shot and said it would take a few days to feel some relief and this morning I woke up feeling a lot better in that area, so I don't have a reason to take anymore. Herein lies my problem. I knew as soon as I took them, the mental obsession would return. I'm writing this and calling my sponsor today so that I'm honest, and keeping myself accountable. My sponsor has been unavailable for the last couple of days, so I haven't shared with her yet, but I know that she will not consider this a relapse since I took them less than prescribed and do not have access to them. 

But, guys... if I had them, they would be 100% gone. Which makes me feel like shit. Each time I asked my husband for the meds, I spent 30 minutes trying to talk myself out of asking, and feeling extremely ashamed for causing him to worry about me. He gave me this really awful look of disgust last night when I asked for them, and I know he is just worried since its the third time I asked. Having him hide them, and have to administer them has kept me from chewing the whole bottle and that really is pathetic. 

That phenomenon of craving is so fucking real, and there has never been any doubt that I'm a true-blue addict regarding these pills. I have nearly 6 months sober and although I haven't relapsed... I know in my heart that I would absolutely relapse if those things were in my possession. 

Guess I just needed to get this out, and keep myself accountable because the shame and the obsession were starting to take my brain through the spin cycle.

 post: So, at 6 and a half months, I finally gave in and asked for a pain script. I had horrifying pain from calcific tendonitis and bursitis in my shoulder. I had powered through, acupuncture, massage, physical therapy and every NSAID possible. The pain was destroying my will to live. 
Asked for Percs because I don't like percs. Made a plan with my sponsor, had my husband hold the pills and only took them at night. 
Here we are a month later and I'm on my third script. Back up to my usual dose and acting like an addict again. I came clean in my meeting last Friday, but I filled another script. No intention on giving them up. They are gonna do surgery on my shoulder in a month and I am in pain, but far less than I was a month ago. 
I'm stuck again. I'm humiliated and embarrassed and I just texted my sponsor to ask if she'd hold my script for me. Dole me out two a day - which I know I'll chew in one sitting. 
This is fucked. 
I hate myself for being unable to just use them for the pain I legitimately have. If I don't hand them off, they'll be gone in 10 days and I'll be in pain again and unable to brave asking for a new script before a month is up. 
What am I supposed to do? I know that I am a fucking jackass when it comes to this shit, but it isn't until the evening when I realize I can't live this way. 
I need some support and some conversation. ",q33,0,0,0,"1,5",0,0,0,0,0,0
Gimme5imStillAlive,OpiatesRecovery,6io4hs,6/21/2017 15:22,0,2,"title: From one former junkie to another. Some advice that has helped me tremendously along my journey through recovery. Much love. .
 post: Time, time, time. 
The fact that time is so universally important in recovery can be beyond frustrating and discouraging, because you can't buy it (as we are used to doing with things we want and/or need), and you can't do anything else except to wait in order to have it. Early in recovery the thoughts of using are so non-stop that it feels as if this is never going to change. And for me, that was often a breaking point. But I was not listening to the advice of my peers which was, in essence, that if you can give yourself enough clean time, you will arrive at a place that is remarkably different than the one you are in right now in your head. 
The memory fades as time goes by. I doubt the memories will ever disappear completely, but I liken it to the memories of an ex-girlfriend. They are romantic memories, and when we think about them, we always conveniently fail to also remember the horrible things that we hated about the relationship. When you first break up, it is pretty much all you can think about- just like dope. But as time passes, those memories become less often, and also less detailed. And you begin to think about this person (drug) a little bit less each day than you did the day before. However if you give in and go spend a night with them (use), then it brings those memories back full force. That is why- if you want to be able to think about things other than the ex-girlfriend or the dope- you have to stay away completely. 

I think this analogy is very fitting, at least in my own personal experience. I would always get clean for 
a month or two, or three, and think to myself ""Wow is this what being clean is like? If so, then I'm never going to succeed because I still feel extremely far from normal"". I would then relapse: then use until I ran out of money or got caught by a DT, or whatever it was that would make me start the 'cleanliness' cycle all over again. 
Just as someone posted above- think about what kind of life you really, truly, want to have and maintain. Make it a realistic and achievable goal. As amazing as it would be to have that goal-life AND be able to use at the same time, we all know that is simply impossible (despite what our minds might suggest to us). I finally was honest with myself about this fact, and have been trying so, so hard to get a truly good amount of time together.  

It was not until I was able to put together a year, which turned into a year and a half (where I am currently), and now I am truly beginning to realize that there is a major difference in my thought process overall. Not only do I think about using exponentially less often than I did before, but I actually think about things that your average person thinks about. When I was actively using, I would always call these 'normal people thoughts' and viewed them as thoughts and feelings that would never be obtainable. Common thoughts about things such as work, and actually wanting to socialize again (FINALLY), and my family, and what I should get to eat later on; I'm sure that is enough examples.
Well- as I was told so many times from people who had experienced this change just as I am now describing it to you- it turns out that with time and true effort, changes in overall everyday thoughts and feelings, and attitude as a whole, really can and does happen. 
It just takes, among the honest desire to remain clean, that dreaded time. That dreaded fucking time, the waiting, the pain; you know how it goes. 

I will leave it at this. One of the people I have met along the way during my most recent and most successful stretch of clean time asked me this simple question:
""How long were you using for?""
Upon my answer of eight years, he replied: ""You have to be realistic with yourself. Do you think you can be back where you want to be in one month after eight years of using? Exactly."" 
That really stuck with me. 

I went to comment on someone else's post and ended up writing all of this. I felt it might be a good idea to share it as a post of its own since it is so long winded (I really cannot help it these days when it comes to the length of the things I begin writing- this stuff has just been flowing out of me lately and it is kind of crazy! But I see it as another sign of improved mental health and processing so I welcome it when it happens!)
My only intention here is to be helpful to others, as well as to my self! Writing and sharing really helps me with my own recovery. I certainly do not have all the answers, nor is my experience the only way that it can go by any means. Good luck everyone with your own personal journeys. We have to try to remember that we deserve to treat ourselves with the same powerful kind of love that we gave to our drug of choice. I hope everyone reading this is having an amazing day and is being safe. I truly thank you for taking the time to read a little piece of my mind today :).

 post: This all just suddenly poured out of me when I intended to write a simple reply. I thought I should share it as a post. 

To anyone who is reading this-  truly ask yourself- do you really, deep down, want to continue the miserable cycle of using? How will that end. The best case scenario is that you don’t OD, in which case you would just be using, getting sick, spending all of your money, always worrying, and surrounded by people who similarly only care about themselves- not because they are inherently bad people- but because they too are a slave to their own addiction. 

I remember when I was using that if I was honest with myself, the answer was always that I wanted to change things and wanted to stop- but the next thought would be that I needed to make a plan first, and certainly couldn’t start right then, because I wanted to do it ‘right’. And if not that, then it would be some other complete bullshit nonsense excuse that my brain would trick me into believing, thus delaying doing what I knew deep down that I really wanted to do. Well consider this: there is no better time than now, because it always is ‘now’. If you put it off until tomorrow, it will still be ‘now’, just tomorrow! And today will be gone. 

I encourage anyone who wants to make that change to realize that you already do know, in your heart, that you are fully capable of changing. I encourage you to truly, completely believe that if you have had the strength to endure the never-ending storm of ALL of the shit that accompanies the horrible road of addiction, then you ABSOLUTELY have the strength to conquer it, and put it (and leave it) in the past where it belongs. Only as a memory that will continue to fade with time until eventually, the seductive power that those memories used to have when you first quit continues to fade as well. And those memories become just that: memories of a life you once lived that is worlds away from the new life that you CAN make for yourself. You just have to truly believe those words. Much love to everyone.

 post: These BILLION dollar pharmaceutical companies like Reckitt-Benckiser (producer of Suboxone) and Actavis (largest producer of Fentanyl), along with all the other companies who make the things that led us here in the first place (prescription opioids) are the same companies making the maintenance drugs for IF we can have the clarity to realize that something needs to change and decide to try to get clean. It’s almost as if they knew that they could create this cycle...

Big tobacco knew they had a product that created dependency. Once the anti-smoking era came along, they were worried about losing their lifelong customers- so they figured out a way to still get their customers’ money. They became the largest producer of smoking cessation products- on top of their products that caused the need for cessation in the first place! From a business standpoint, they struck gold. The nicotine patch, gum, lozenges, and everything else. So when one of their customers decides it’s time to give it up, they buy the patch, etc- from the same fucking companies. And the money keeps flowing. 

Myself as well as the large majority of opiate users I have met along my journey through recovery all have almost the same story. Got injured in some way, got prescribed Vicodin, Percocet, Oxys, even fucking Fentanyl in some cases- and then, after unknowingly becoming physically dependent on the medication (which the doctors often failed to warn about), the doc suddenly ends the script. And as I’m sure you all know how the story continues, I’ll just skip to the part where you are in desperate need of help and recovery. 
They put you on Suboxone, or methadone, or any other maintenance drug. And those drugs are made by... the same companies that make the Percocet and the Oxy, etc. Seems to me they have figured out how to keep the money flowing, even when their previous ‘customers’ decide it’s time to stop. 
Thank you for listening to my rant. It helps to write it out and I am especially interested in hearing what everyone else here thinks- and any stories or thoughts or feelings that anyone wants to share. I would love to hear from anyone going through this very difficult journey. Much love everyone, and stay strong my friends. ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

 post: Really hypothetical, just writing this for fun as a thought experiment, as I’m curious if anyone has ever thought about this, and what you all think about this.
So as most of us know, withdrawal is very similar to the flu. I just had the thought that if someone who is on subs, methadone, or using, and has been wanting to jump off/get clean...
If you happen to be unlucky enough to have gotten the flu- would that not be a potentially perfect situation to just jump off? Since you are already experiencing all of the terrible physical symptoms whether you like it or not, I wonder if this situation would make it “easier” both physically and mentally, since you know you are going to feel that way regardless of using or not.
This probably applies more to people on maintenance, as I would imagine if you get the flu while actively using, that’s most likely just a reason to use more to make it ‘better’. 
As I said, this just popped into my head and I thought it would be fun to see what others in this community think about it. More in theory than in practice, but still!!",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0

 post: And I truly cannot get over how much I have changed, for the better, since doing so. I was in recovery, and actually a year or so into it at that point. I’ll never forget it- constant memories of using and wanting to use. I really thought it might never end.
Well, sure, it would be a lie to say all of that BS has totally ended. However it has subsided to a degree and on a level on which I did not even know existed. 
Never once did I think that I would ever think about dope (and it’s companions) without romanticizing. But I was wrong. I just want to write this so that those who are in the state and/or timeframe that I was in at this point two years ago to know that it gets so, so much better. Unfortunately, time away from the game and everything involved with it is another very important factor and it feels unfair, because time is not something that we can manipulate (as we are all so well versed in doing one way or another) and b/c of that it is frustrating and almost can feel futile. Well- DONT LET IT do that to you. Conquer time, and you will be well on your way. 
I am so unbelievably proud to say that I have an amazing career now, and most importantly, people who truly care about me. Don’t let this shit define you. Instead, let it be something that maybe did define you for a little bit, or however long, but now YOU define IT as a bad time in your life- but a time in which you realized what was happening- and during which you took back control.
To everyone and anyone reading this feeling no way out- please know that I am thinking of you, and that things will work out. You know you’re ready to make that step towards getting clean. Don’t put it off, as you know you can do that forever, and suddenly it’s 20 years later. Do it tonight/tomorrow. Take that one baby step- that could lead toward a path that you will one day look back on and be so unbelievably grateful for and proud of. I love you all.

 post: Hey guys,

How’s it going? I recently joined this subreddit after being 2 weeks at my new sober house. It looks like an awesome place. Here’s a little bit about me. Sorry it’s a little long, but I really liked writing this all out. 

So yes, I am a complete opiate addict. Heroin addict, painkiller addict, also a Benzo/Cocaine addict. I’ve done many drugs in my life, I’m not sure people can name many I didn’t do. I never fell in love with a drug so much like opiates though. I remember doing them in high school for the first time, which is weird I don’t remember my first time with any other drug other than LSD, I guess it shows how much I fell in love with them. I managed to rarely do them in HS and in college my friends just didn’t touch them. Blue’s (30mg roxys) just weren’t that big yet, just yet. I did them in high school, but I literally never saw them in college. I drank a ton in college, took benzos, Cocaine, lsd all the time nothing was a so called “issue” but looking back I totally see how much I loved just being fucked up. 

I managed to graduate somehow, I never went to class it was pure adderal binges before tests. My main goal in college was girls, getting fucked up, my friends, and partying. I met the girl of my dreams my senior year who I ended up dating for 4 years as well, life was good, or so I thought. I graduated, moved to nyc, and had a solid job at a one of the largest banks in the world as an investment banker. I thought I was the shit. I was making money, had a hot girlfriend, nice apartment in Manhattan. What I learned was how empty this all was. 

I specifically remember after work early on in my career taking Xanax almost everyday after work. I was bored, tired, and oh ya I was Fucking bored. Life was such a grind and although everything looked so good on the outside I was crawling out of my skin. Once I had my own money I remember for the first time I could buy some 30mg Oxys, a bunch of bars, Cocaine every time I went out. It was a mess. I managed to contain my issue and not become an addict for 1.5 years. I moved departments in my company and my job just become 20x more stressful. On top of that my new job wanted me to take a 3 Month intense fucking training in the summer. This meant not seeing any of my friends who were going away every weekend and my girlfriend was going to bitch and complain about not doing much in the summer. I had tests 3x a week that required basically all nighters and i needed to pass or I would get fired. It was a total bitch. I learned quickly that I can take oxy’s in class and while I’m studying. I felt good, I was able to focus, and I didn’t mind all the work...obviously I was Fucking high. That summer my little issue became a huge issue. By the end of the summer I spent close to 45k on pills, Cocaine, and Xanax. My girlfriend started to notice who I hid this from with my life. She’s not an addict, she drinks like a normal person (dam normies, I’ll never get them). I would be nodding out when I was with her regularly and was getting questioned if I was high which I denied. By the end of that summer I was completely addicted and taking 8 30mg oxys a day. My addiction progressed fast as Fuck.

For about a year I was on this crazy routine except my 8 pills a day probably went to 12 and I was spending so much money on pills it was absurd. I went to an addiction psych who’s actually a really great guy, to try and quit. I told my girlfriend and she was “happy I was getting help”. I quit and was put on suboxone (fuck that shit). I went through withdrawal for 2 weeks and I got a call right after 2 weeks from my girlfriend. I really loved this girl and struggle slightly with her to this day. I have 0 contract with her now and will never contact her on my own. My girlfriend calls and breaks up with me. Clearly due to my addiction and me being a fuck  in a “normies” eyes. My little stint with sobriety was over that night. I was broken as a person, I ruined the best thing in my life over pills. It hurt tremendously. 

My addiction from than on went fucking insane. I started doing heroin because pills were too much money. I was doing heroin all day/night with Xanax on top. Cocaine during work so I could function. I was heartbroken for the longest time.  I was numb from life. I didn’t give a fuck. I lost all my friends because I was so isolated, I lost respect from my parents, my work life finally caught up with me and my boss was catching on. I spent all my money I ever made and created a huge Fucking debt with credit cards for drugs. My life was in shambles. 

This went on for another year and some change.  My doctor and parents would try so hard to send me to treatment but I always refused to acknowledge I had an issue. I would go to IOP for a week than fail drug tests and never go back. I didn’t care. I was making money from work so I thought, oh I’m not so bad. But, my job  ran its course. My boss fired me because I was Fucking noticeably high every single day. I than upped my addiction more. 3-5 bundles of H a day, Xanax use was out of control, so much Cocaine I never even slept. I was completely out of money, my credit cards were maxed the fuck out, I was lucky to even be alive. 

My parents caught me on thanksgiving as I’m nodding out on the table and said this is the last straw you have to fix your life. I finally gave in and dam did it feel good. I told them to send me to rehab. I went to Caron in Pennsylvania and god dam was it the most life changing experience of my whole life. I became myself again. I was social and outgoing connecting with people everyday. I loved the kids in my unit at rehab, all awesome people. It felt so great to literally just give up and listen to what people were telling me. So I completed rehab, which was the best experience of my life, and said screw it I’m not going back to manhattan. I was provided with a sober living option out in LA from my counselor in rehab because I said if I’m moving I want it to be hot and a nice city, lucky me. I took the option, and now I’ve been at sober living for 3 weeks still clean and happier than I’ve ever been. Seriously, I know I don’t wanna say never, but I am liking where I’m at too much right now to go back to that fucking hell hole place I was in. 

I currently go to IOP 5x a week, meetings 5-6x a week, hit the gym 4-5x a week, and my sober living and IOP drug test me numerous times a week. I’m 40 something days sober (I don’t count). 

Sure withdrawing is fucking hell, rehab is a nightmare at first. But what I learned and what I did that changed my life, is I just accepted where I am and I listen to the advice I’m given It’s so freeing. I’m excited for what life has in store with me. I wouldn’t trade my past for anything. I think us as addicts have a dam interesting and crazy journey and I’m happy to be part of this group of amazing characters. I’d rather have a challenging and interesting life where I get to meet new great people than the typical grind everyday for emptiness life. 

One thing I do wanna say if any vets could help. I’m not so sold on the 12 steps, I guess it looks so daunting. Do any of you have any advice? Do I absolutely need it?

Anyway, to anyone struggling out there, don’t be afraid to get help. Also, listen to the people around you and the professionals trying to help you get better. 

If anyone wants to chat privately about rehab or sober living feel free to PM me.

 post: Hey homies,

I hope you all are doing awesome! I wanted to post this, I’ve tried to talk about it in groups and rehab but it’s hard to explain really. I wanted to see if anyone else feels like this.

So I am about 90-100 days clean. It’s the most clean time I’ve had and I seriously couldn’t be happier. Sure, I have issues going on in my life (money), but it’s okay!

I’ve had this strong feeling that I wanted to share. I see so many people bummed out by recovery and I wanted to give my take on it. This might be long winded because I have trouble explaining it.

Is anyone else here thankful they were addicts and are now in recovery? What I mean is, a lot of people, especially in early recovery, that are pissed off they are here. Whether it’s sober living, rehab, or angry they even had to go through this. Yeah, shit sucked for a while and this isn’t easy, but I can’t help but feel happy that this happened to me. Here are my reasons:

I was able to change my life completely. I was working and grinding all day in finance for years. Using everyday. It was a living hell. Sure, I was making really good money. But money seriously does not make you happy at all. If I was never an addict, I would have never left my job and moved across country to a LA which I love. I know myself and I would’ve stayed at my job and hated my life until I retired. I’m really grateful I was able to do this. And it taught me the biggest fucking lesson, and at a young age (I’m 26). It’s that I can be the happiest I’ve ever been with close to nothing. I don’t need a fancy ass job with material possessions. That is not what makes me happy. 

The people. What I mean by this, is I’ve met the most interesting and amazing people in recovery. My sponsor, my sober living housemates, people at meetings, people from rehab. Just overall I’m so happy that I get to spend my time with people who are trying to better themselves and create real connections. It’s so dam refreshing. 

Life experiences. I’ll be damned if I’m going to die saying I didn’t experience life. Being an addict/now entering recovery has been so fulfilling. I feel like I finally have a purpose and I went through some crazy shit in My life and experienced more at the age of 26 than most people do in there lifetime. From my crazy drug dealing/addict days to now changing my whole life. It’s been a really crazy experience and I’m grateful to have it.

So does anyone else, besides me, feel like our experience has been a huge teacher in life and something that you are actually thankful that you went through? I feel almost blessed that I am able to live my life this way. I know it sounds crazy. But what is fun about being “normal”? I for one am very happy and excited for my life to come and I’m glad I get to have this experience to fall back on forever. It really has changed me as a human. 

For all the people in early recovery, don’t complain about rehab, sober living, or meetings. Enjoy it, have fun, cherish the people you are meeting and create lifelong connections.  Be grateful we got to experience some real ass shit in our life. Most people don’t.

I wanted to talk for a second, I’ve had a rough day. First, I hope everyone is doing awesome and I’m sending love to everyone.

I woke up this morning with a call from my sponsors girlfriend - he passed away today. Young dude, had so much going for him, 3 years clean and used once and now he’s gone. I’m clean under a year and it’s so shocking to me that he used. I’m blown away at what happened and I feel so shitty about it. 

He was one of the guys at AA who I fully looked up to. Smart, reliable, was all about recovery and sponsored 3-4 young guys. From the outside he looked so solid and about his recovery. I’m deeply saddened by this and I wanted to share with everyone my thoughts, today taught me a lot.

Addiction is nothing at all to fuck with. For all of you new guys, this shit literally kills people. I know when I was using and getting clean I always thought “oh I won’t be THAT guy”. Seriously though, you never fucking know. Don’t fuck with this disease at all. Don’t think you’re better than anyone, you’re not. Nobody deserves death. The guy had a GF he just moved in with and many dear friends who are all torn apart by the news. He dropped so much knowledge on me that I’ll take with me for the rest of my life.

Please everyone, get clean and stay clean. Life is so much more than an early death to an OD and being an addict with nothing to live for. It’s not worth it, not even once.  Get out of the mindset that you’re smarter than this, you’re absolutely not and understand the consequences addiction can bring. 

You all have something to live for and people love you. 

Peace and love to you all",q0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

 post: Hey guys,

So I finally reached a year sober literally today - but it’s the most down I’ve ever felt. I wanted to give a short rundown on what happened.

So I was doing REALLY fucking well for a long time. Hitting the gym up everyday almost, work, loving sobriety (I still do, just some shit happened and I had a rough past 2 months).

I looked great, people would compliment me on how young I was looking etc. So in early October I had a slight incident at work and my arm got burned. Thing is, I had a tattoo there that got mangled. Not horribly fucked up by any means, but it’s one of 2 tattoos that I have and I went into a HARD depression about it. I know most people here will be like dude it’s a tattoo get over it, but it for some reason really got to me. I would not want to wake up most days, I wouldn’t want to go to the gym. My mind would think about it nonstop. I used to be proud of my tattoos and now one of them I almost hate. 

My skin is healing fine, but the tattoo healed a little crooked which also, is getting to me. Some ink was lost also. 

So for the last month and half since the start of my sobriety I was actually depressed. I started to lack on self care hard. And little by little thanksgiving was coming around and I would be home for the first time in a year to see my parents. So my self confidence was basically at an all time low, I just didn’t feel good about myself probably because of the depression and lack of self care. 

My ex who I dated for 3.5 years finally opened up to me and wanted to see me. This girl is truly an amazing person. Beautiful, smart, has her shit together, I think about her all the time. I went to go see her and I just felt and looked disheveled. Not how I wanted to look when I first see my ex after a year of sobriety...hair and beard was a mess etc. 

I left her place and I felt this sudden wave of “I’m not good enough for her anymore”. It’s really been fucking w me as I’ve always been a very confident guy. For the first time in my life I feel really low. It’s fucking crazy how a small accident at work could have this insane spiral effect on my life, but it did. 

I just wanted to share this with you guys. I spoke to my sponsor about it who is telling me this is God’s will. Which I have to believe! I’m trying to really find the positive in all of this but it’s hard right now. I’ve never felt so low on myself in a long time to the point of where I look in the mirror and I don’t like who I see. It’s fucking weird. 

I do see some positive in this as this was a huge challenge in my sobriety and I’m pushing through. I’ve made promises to myself that I’m not skipping out in the gym anymore and I went and got a haircut and beard trim today. I have to do more self care and get out of this weird funk.

To me - this was a really crazy lesson in “things don’t always go as planned”. This works with my tattoo (I never planned on it getting fucked up) and going home and imagining seeing my ex for the first time and it goes amazingly - to me leaving feeling like fuck I totally fucked up something amazing and I can’t get that back

Thanks for listening guys. Recovery is hard. I just have to remember I’m on the right path right now. ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Hey guys,

Hope y’all are doing well. Wanted to just ask a quick questions. I’m over 1 year into sobriety and I still am very sensitive to the cold. It’s not horrible by any means, but I literally hate being cold it. I’m not sure if it’s a mental thing or what but I definitely feel extra sensitive when I’m in cold weather (thank god I moved to LA)

Does anyone else have this? It gets me really uncomfortable sometimes. Today was a little brutal I was almost shivering and it was like 55 degrees...

It has a great effect with tramadol, increasing the opiate quality to the high and giving it an almost MDMA like stimulation and some visual distortion while also preventing seizures caused by tramadol overdose. 
With pure opiates I find that if I nod out with pregabalin 300mg I’ll fall asleep for about 12 hours (with fentanyl IV). With pregabalin 75mg, I get a bit of stimulation with the opiate high.

Unlike drugs affecting sodium channels, GABAa receptors, opioid receptors, drugs blocking VDCCs don’t always have an immediate or powerful effect or rush or even predictable effects in everyone as the distribution and gain of calcium channel containing neurons is very different in different brains. 
In some people VDCC blockage may cause stimulation in others sedation, it makes it an unpredictable drug.

 post: So long short story... I was running out of options one day, my refills for oxy 30’s, Norcos’s and somas were a week out, I was broke and needed a fix. Having bad back problems at such a young age(24) I’ve always found it easy to get what medicines I’ve wanted, and have been in pain management 4+ years. I had been many times to ER faking back pain to get a shot of Diladuid and Valium, but after 4 visits in 6 months I didn’t wanna raise red flags but had to get high and my paycheck was over a week away and refills not ready. I went in complaining of extreme bladder pain, I even lied down on floor in ER and fake cried with eye drops with a dash of salt mixed in bottle. They rush me back there and I tell them I believe I have kidney stones. The nurse asked for a piss sample, and when I went into the bathroom I pulled out my trusty old syringe. Looking up the symptoms online, I saw pee in blood is a big indicator of kidney stones. So I filled about 1/4 of my rig full of blood and mixed enough into my full cup(ofcourse yelling-trying not to laugh at how absurd this situation was in bathroom as I went. I  looked in mirror and noticed bags under my eyes and I was sweating, definitely looked the part.) Anyhow, I mixed a very small amount of blood into my pee in the cup and gave it to the nurse. After a few tests and the seeing doctor, I’m hooked onto an IV for dehydration and that ever warm and lovely 4mg diladuid shot, usually they do 2 but doctor put order in for 2 because height, weight and tolerance for pain management. In his eyes, I’m just a 24 year old with “kidney stones” and was given 90 Percocet 10’s for the extreme discomfort I had coming... quite the opposite actually. I played the guy like a goddamn fiddle! Just wanted to share just one of many over the top charades I’ve put on to continue obtaining real pharmaceutical narcotics.

 post: To everyone reading this, if you've seen my last posts on opiates you would know I was starting on heroin and slightly bragging about how good it made me feel.

You all told me not to do it anymore and that I was stupid for thinking this way. I just thought to myself ""man what do these guys know let me buy a bun"".

I am sorry. I know you guys were just trying to help me and I foolishly didn't listen to your advice. I made my mother cry last night. I haven't done that in a long time, I haven't even seen her cry in a long time but I saw it last night. I am not myself anymore. I can't think like myself anymore. I don't feel good like I used to anymore. I don't feel high like I was before. 

I sold my xbox about a week ago to get some more money to give to my dealer. My dad's present to me. I remember thinking getting that xbox is the best present a guy could have. And it was. I never got bored of it. I loved COD, gears of war, assassin's creed, and I sold it along with all of those games for another fucking cop of diesel. 

I want to thank you guys so much for warning me, and apologize once more for ignoring it like the fucking dick head I am. I am in a rough spot right now. I can't think straight right now. I'm scared. Im scared of what's in my future. I miss the past. 

I'm sorry if this posts is written weird...the time you hook to read this post is probably the same exact time it took me to type it bUT I just feel I needed to owe you guys an apology.

Please. If you're thinking of trying heroin please please please do not do it. It's not fun anymore. Please don't do it. Please listen to the good people here who tell you not to fuck with it. Please don't make the same mistake I made. Because at this point I don't think I can manage much longer. 


Please just don't snort that bag. Please just be clean from it. You're too precious for this drug and you can't imagine what it would do to you. What you can become. What you would do for another cop of heroin... I'm crying right now so excuse any typos. 

I wished I listened to you guys. Feel free to call me a dumbas for not following your advice. I already know how stupid I seem now.

Sorry again... and sorry to the people Ive turned down advice.

 post: Hey guys. I need some insight on passing types of drug tests. 
I'm in sober living(not exactly my choice) and they do a couple types of drug screenings. They do saliva, and urine. I've been at this particular house for a month and the only time I've been tested was the first and second day I got here. They were both 12 panel(I think) saliva cube tests, so I had to suck/chew on this nasty cardboard-like sponge and put it back in the container when it was all wet. 
Since it's been a while from the last time they tested me, I'm not going to try to use because the probability that they'll do it soon is so likely.
But anyways: Is there any way to pass these just in case?? 
My DOC is heroin so that's really all I'm curious about. But who knows what it could be mixed with.

 post: I've been sober for 13 months this coming Friday, my son is almost 8 weeks old, I'm gaining so much in my life and I'm actually happy, so why do I still want to get high? I'm on deferred disposition for a DVA charge from 2015, and will be until Sept '18. I really think that if I didn't have time hanging over my head and the possibility of losing my son if I fuck up again, I'd probably be high by now as bad as that sounds. 
I know I have a lot to lose. And I've come very close to relapsing, but haven't. 
I really wish I was normal, and could use here and there without totally destroying everything I've worked for. 
I just miss how good the needle feels and the warm rush. I miss the fast life, late nights, loud music, excitement, the uncertainty and danger. But I know I'll never be able to feel it again. When I got clean, I didn't think my last shot of heroin would be the last one for the rest of my life. And thinking like that scares me so I guess like they say in the halls 'one day at a time'. 
My life is moving in such a positive direction, but of course with my thought process I'm trying to devise a plan for when I'm through with the court system so I can use in moderation, and sell on the side again. 
And being a young single mom is hard. I feel like I'm going to be alone forever because no one wants a sober girl with a kid. Boring, right?
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for everything and everyone in my life, but damn, being sober gets so boring sometimes. 
Shit. I can't stop dreaming about going to cop, hitting up a safe spot, and nodding out. Good times?.. and then I forget about the nights of endless crying, multiple suicide attempts, and complete isolation. I guess you could say I like to sugarcoat it. Ugh. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way, or what?

 post: Okay so I was reading a post about how some people on here pretty much have a life while using opiates. I’m in awe because being able to manage my use and maintain my relationship with my boyfriend, be a good mom, and work/go to school/ pay bills on time would be great. And I know that’s it hard as fuck to do that successfully, but does anyone have like, tips on managing opiate use?

I’m also currently in sober living due to my conditions of release/deferred disposition and will have just over 2 years clean when I can leave here. I’m fully aware it’s a stupid idea to even attempt to use after that long but if I were to ever do it again, I’d like to know what other people do. If I could even do a .5 a day I’d be happy.

 post: 7/18/16 was the day I actually got sober. The 17th was the last time I had a shot of heroin. It’s been a loooong year and a half but I’m damn proud of myself. And I successfully used pain meds while giving birth to my first child last June, only because I didn’t expect to have a c-section. But, I’m also on deferred disposition and court ordered in sober living. So honestly I’m not sure what’s actually keeping me sober, however I could’ve easily gotten high because my sober house BARELY drug tests. I mean like once a month or two. 

There’s a part of me that really does want to stay clean, but a stronger side that’s telling me I can manage using again. I keep telling myself it was never that bad, and I didn’t use long enough, or my bottom wasn’t low enough. But I don’t have to experience that suffering if I choose not to. My life is pretty fucking good, and if the only thing I’m worrying about now is losing sleep due to a small child then I’ll take it. 

Idk. I guess all I’m saying is that sobriety is possible. So if you’re getting sober, don’t give up. Just wanted to put it out there!😊",q0,0,0,"1,3",0,0,0,3,0,0,0

 post: This is my first reddit ever. So Waddup.  Apologize in advance for any errors in etiquette. 

I don't want to go into my whole thing… but I'm sure it's similar to many of you. Started with stealing some vikes, saying hell yeah. 2 years later pumping Oxys in my system like crazy [in between tried pretty much all other drugs including alcohol waaaayy more casually]. Eventually-Important people (who really care) find out...

This is kind of where I'm at right now. For the first time I actually have admitted to myself that I was (am?) addicted to opiates, and have made appointments for next week to see a physician and an outpatient addiction counselor. I'll also add that in 5 days clean right now, but on my 3rd attempt (longest was 17 days) since Jan., so physically feeling pretty alright. 

Here is my question to y'all:

As I read about opiate addiction, Awake with no sleep at 5 am, I'm feeling slightly discouraged.  It's not the depression that comes with the [PAWS] territory... This is something else: it just seems like unless I completely change my life, I'm destined to fail. Has anyone else had this feeling early in the process, before talking to doctors, counselors, etc.? All of the literature is, for the most part is, super sober people saying the only way to do this is 100% straight, OR people thinking they thought could do it their way and being wrong. 

It makes me really sad to think I won't be able to go have a drink with friends, or go out on the weekends (without risk of relapse). Anyone else?

MittenProblemChild,OpiatesRecovery,212fta,3/22/2014 6:10,0,1,"title: 33arly Morning Thoughts... my message to folks on day 1 .
 post: 33 days clean today, and super proud of it.  I'm feeling pretty good, and every day is GETTING BETTER.  I've been hitting my outpatient program super hard, 1 on 1 every Tuesday and group 3 times a week.  As my mind continues to clear it's fog, and the space fills up with THINGS, I've had a little less time to check reddit every 5 minutes and see whats up with my recovering homies.  I've been sleeping really well, but randomly tonight I have so many thoughts (good ones) running through my head that I find myself awake.  Just wanted to get a few thoughts out:

1.  Getting sober REALLY is awesome.  Here is my thought process on this from day 1 until now, just so you can get an idea of what it might look like for you. 
 
-Stage 1 ""These people on this subreddit saying how great being sober is, they've been brainwashed by NA, or maybe didn't get as deep as me.  Maybe I'm just wired different or something.  Whatever it is, I know I'm never going to be fulfilled without pills again. No way...NEVER.""

-Stage 2 ""I've got a week.  I can tell the worst part is over, but FUCK THIS.  I'm a piece of shit, I still want drugs all the time.  Shut up about your fucking meetings, that's not for me.  it won't help.  I'm going to continue to sit here and do nothing.""

-Stage 3 ""Alright, let me give this 'active recovery' thing a try.  I still want to get fucked up, but I'm not actually scheming in my mind how I can do it.

-Stage 4 ""A couple meetings under my belt, some counseling, it's all about staying so fresh and so CLEAN.  I'm starting to do things I forgot I enjoyed to do- it's awesome.

That was a long #1 and the main inspiration for this post.  So, just a couple other quick things regarding thought process.

2. [Most of Us] really were pieces of shit.  When you're longing for your days of using, truthfully think to yourself what you're romanticizing.  You were a strung out dude, passed out on the couch.  Ok... Maybe a bit of an exaggeration; or not true at all for some people.  Although many days were spent in a haze on the couch, I was a pretty high functioning addict.  But whatever it was, I'm sure it wasn't pretty.  That place sucks.  Stay here with me.  With US.

3. I've said what I want to say. Get Money, Fuck [pretty, intelligent ladies].  Do You.  A penny saved is a penny earned.  All dat, cause cash rules.  Oh yeah, all you ciggy smokers, get on that VAPE life. I heard smoking is bad for you on the news. :---) DUECES",q0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: Wassup everybody! It's been a while since I've posted here.  Here's what's been up:

After about 2 months of clean time, I started using again.  First it was Weed, then it was Xanax... before long I was shooting Heroin every day.  It got bad very quickly.  I used every day for about a month.  I was stealing and pawning my mom's jewelry to get money for dope.  It wasn't long before my family caught on to me nodding out everywhere, and eventually noticed her jewelry was missing... Shit got real, real fast.  I almost got kicked out of my parents house, almost got the cops called on me, but instead convinced my parents to give me one more chance.

You know in recovery, how they talk about that moment where it clicks? Well I had one of those.  At that moment, nothing mattered except for recovery.  I was (an still am) so exhausted with everything and everybody that had to do with my using that I was willing to do anything to be clean.

I got back into my outpatient rehab program.  I started seeing a new psychologist.  I was doing this stuff before though, and I knew I needed to do something else.  I finally decided to listen to everyone on here, and all of my counselors and check out NA.  42 days later, I'm happy to say that I've been to 42 meetings, and I'm a grateful RECOVERING ADDICT.  NA and the people in the fellowship have been so fucking amazing.  Everyday, I wait in excitement for the evening to come, so I can go to my meeting. 

To anyone that is hesitant to go, or thinks their recovery program doesn't need NA, I urge you to give it a shot.  And don't just go one day, give it an honest chance.  I wish I could tell you how against that shit I was before I started going, so anyone in that same position would realize who this message is coming from.   I almost guarantee if you give it a shot, you will find something useful.

 post: I know NA is about accepting everyone. However, that doesn't mean we can't get a little frustrated from time to time. A lot of the time when we get frustrated, it really has to do with us... Some personal character defect causes us to take what someone else is sharing and internalize that something is wrong with them. 

That being said, I figured we could have a little fun and share out NA pet peeves. Something that no matter how accepting you are, makes your skin crawl a bit. I'm sure all of us know that one guy that says the same thing every day, or shares forever. I would say mine is probably when people ramble about shit that has absolutely no relevance to recovery. Like I sat with this once chick who was going on and on for like 10 minutes about her boy troubles, and how she couldn't get laid. Ugh, makes me crazy.

 post: So I've been noticing a lot of posts lately where people in recovery are talking about how they still drink, or take benzos, or smoke weed… you get it. When I read stuff like that I feel myself getting angry for some reason. It's been bothering me that I get so angry, so I've been thinking a lot about why. 

At first I was telling myself that I felt bad for those people.  That I was sad that they haven't found true recovery yet.  That being said,  I keep hearing my psychologist's voice in my head. ""If you find yourself getting angry/impatient/any negative emotion, it's probably one of your own character defects that's respinsible; not the other person"". So what is it that's making me feel the way I do when I read this stuff? 

Here's what Ive come up with: With only 60 days clean myself, I think I'm a little jealous that other opiate addicts are still using mind altering chemicals. In some weird way, I wish I could sill drink or smoke or take other pills, and those suppressed longings are turning into something different. 

That being said, I have no intentions of doing so.  I've accepted that I'm not only an opiate addict, but I'm an ADDICT ADDICT. No mind altering chemicals for me. And I truly do hope that if you're an addict, that you find peace in your recovery, however you do it. Sorry if I've come off like a Dick in any of my comments in the past couple weeks.

It's from a rap song called ""Commencement at the Obedience Academy"" by this dude Aesop Rock (not A$AP rocky), and it's also (as I found out after I got it) from the movie Revenge of the Body Snatchers.

So I'm 25 and I get my 90 days 100% sober this week. I've been talking to this REALLY REALLY hot 18 year old girl at meetings lately and I'm pretty sure she's feeling me.  Everything in me is feeling her back except for... MY FUCKING RECOVERY. Ugh, I hate this moral and rational compass I'm developing. 

I've never been with someone younger than me let alone 7 years; in fact I've pretty much only been with older girls. But her actual age doesn't really bother me. She's cool as fuck and has obviously been through a fair amount, already being in NA at that age. There's just something about it though...

The whole one year rule is in the back of my mind. How can I expect someone to be where I need them to be, if I'm not where I need me to be? I can't just hit it and quit it either, cause that's just a shitty thing to do to someone, especially in early recovery. But she's so hot!!

Ahh, I don't know what to do!!! Please don't think of me as arrogant or whatever trying to get y'all to be like ""Ohhh there's MittenPC trying to say he gets pussy"". I swear I'm just at a loss with this one.

 post: I'm not gonna tell my whole story again, but basically, the spirituality aspect of NA kept me away for the longest time. I don't consider myself religious so I thought the fellowship wasn't for me. After a bad relapse, I found myself hopeless and ended up at the tables as a last resort. I didn't know what else to do. 100+ days later and I've been to at least one meeting pretty much every day. I'm pretty confident I'd be using if it wasn't for NA. 

Many people are scared away from 12 step groups because they are spiritual programs. But the mistake I was making was assuming that spirituality = religion. Because of my feelings on religion, it's taken me a while to figure out what spirituality means to me. Here's what I've come up with: it's about having a set of values/principles, and living by them. Something I never came close to doing when I was sticking needles in my arm. 

How about y'all? No wrong answers, I'm just curious whether you go to meetings or not. ",q22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Hey reddit, I have four months clean today. These four months have been the hardest I've ever worked in my entire life. I've never had this amount of clean time ever. The longest I used to have was 39 days and the entire time I was white knuckling and just trying to get some cash together to go out and do what I did best. What made me want to change for the better was being in the ER after almost over dosing on heroin and acting very belligerent towards my mom. To this day I still have no idea what I said or did that caused her to call the cops. She went to the ER later that day because I was almost 51/50, I have a long history with mental illness and a year and a half ago I was diagnosed bipolar. She took my phone, cash, and told me that I was on my own and that our family did not want to do anything with me if I was still using. I had been alone, I ran away and went hitchhiking a few times and always came back. What she said really struck home and I knew that I had to do better. Since then I got my car back, some freedom, and I currently have a 4.0 in college.Because of my different illnesses I've decided that I want to help people and I'm going to school to be a psychologist. Recovery is possible. It's definitely not easy at all but I guarantee that the results are beautiful.

 post: So it's been a while since I've posted on this subreddit, I hope you all are doing well. At this point of my life I can honestly say that I have never been happier. Although my life is far from perfect meaning I still don't have a job, my dad can still be a verbally abusive person, and I still can't find my cat who ran away a couple of months ago I still live for each day. I'm at that point of realization that as much as I try I cannot change people, places, or things but I can choose whether to let it affect me or not. I could drown in self pity which leads to getting loaded, but really that solves nothing except feeling good for two hours and being back on the hamster wheel of addiction. This wheel that I'm grateful for everyday that I don't have to be on. 

A little over six months ago, I remember getting strung out in a public bathroom on the boardwalk in Huntington Beach, California. I remember thinking to myself that this is really not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. I'm nineteen years old, this really isn't what somewhat normal teenagers do when at the beach with their families. During the entire time I was in that stall a part of me really wished I could die and escape this existence because I knew how every last pickup would end. It was like a ticking time bomb until something seriously bad would happen. For me, that something really bad was always a mental hospital. This was the last time I hope I would ever use heroin.

Today I live a somewhat clean life. I don't tag like I used to, or shoplift, or disrespect people who I deemed as conformists. I'm still promiscuous by nature and smoke way to many cigarettes each day. I'm far from perfect and still have defects of character that I work on. I'm grateful for all of the friends and family in my life. This was my first clean Christmas in a few years and I was very happy to spend it with people I genuinely care about. I even went to a meeting that night which was awesome! Someone even brought Christmas cookies. 

To anyone who is in early recovery, I want to tell you that it is possible to enjoy life without drugs. I didn't believe it was possible a few months ago but as time went on and I began going to meetings and realizing what life was really about was when I became happier. Today I consider it a blessing that 
I can do stupid shit with my friends like creep around an attic looking for ghosts and wearing a wizard hat just to wear a wizard hat. Anyway, I hope you all have a beautiful day or night.",q0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: As I sit on my back porch smoking a red, wearing my designer duds(not like that truly does but ya know), and waiting for my tamales to be cooked I truly realize how good my life has been good to me now that I’m clean. Today I’ve got 90 days. 90 days ago I was sitting in the IOP program at the Betty Ford Center stung out of my mind with twenty dollars in my pocket anxiously waiting for it to be over that day so that my friend and I could go score yet again. On the break I was busted and sent to to detox there again for the fourth time. I felt hopeless, useless, and afraid. Earlier that summer I was diagnosed as being bipolar and having borderline personality disorder. I felt even more afraid being told that I was being shipped off to the Hazelden in MN. I was pissed off at not only not being able to have my last 20 dollar fix but by my parent shipping me off to fucking MN where it’s cold as hell. When I had got there I was still pissed and made a promise to myself that I’d only stay there for a week, I mean I had front row seats to a Green Day concert along with having one of my “ best friends” moving back to NM. I had missions to go and bust. After a week, I realized how truly sick I was and that I truly need to stay. I signed on for 6 weeks. I paid for it all myself out of pocket. Before this all happened I had been a very successful escort and had more money than god. In that time I got healthier each day. I quit participating in every unhealthy behavior I had which included anorexia and body mutilation( there are some weird fucks who think that’s really sexy) when I returned home I made a 180. My parents are proud of me with all the hard work I put in to stay clean, my boyfriend and I got back together when he had gotten back home from Kuwait( he’s a corpsman in the Navy) and my sister hates me significantly less. This man who’s my boyfriend talked with me every day despite the time difference between us and he even picked me up from the airport. He’s one of the very few who stuck by me through thick and thin, and disputed how badly I’ve fucked him over knew I only acted as such when I was using. 
The reason for this long tangent is to say that there’s always hope and always someone to love you even in your darkest of times. Being truly happy is possible even when you have more issues than Vogue. If there’s those on this sub who are still using,There’s government programs available as well as rehabs such as BFC who do financial assistance. Before my relapse 1 and 1/2 years ago, I had almost three years clean and I can honestly say I’m much happier now because I addressed problems I’ve always had. 

TLDR; someone loves you, happiness is possible when clean, and there’s always someone out there who will care enough about you to help. I hope you all an amazing day ❤️",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: So I'm going to cop from my normal dude, and he's blowing up my phone trying to get me to hurry. Well I answer the phone the last time to tell him I'm about to turn on the street, and this foreign guy who looks like French Montana cut me off so I honked at him. He then proceeds to get out of his car screaming at me and waving a fucking bat around telling me to get out of the car. I say fuck that and speed off, luckily my dude was on the corner already so I pull up and do the transaction in about 3 seconds and the guy pulls in front of me and does the same shit! I speed off and he continues to follow me, weaving through traffic and driving on the wrong side of the road. This goes on for another few minutes and then I see him get on his phone to call some friends to help him. At this point I say fuck it and call the cops because this isn't going to stop on its own until he either gets pulled over or beats me with his baseball bat. Not even 2 seconds after I dial 911, a car in front of me tries to block me in! This is a different car than the original guy so now I have 2 people chasing me. I remember that on my way over to cop I passed a bunch of police officers that were conducting a bust or something at a house so I head back that way. On my way there, a third car starts fucking chasing me!!! Keep in mind I'm in a major city, on busy roads weaving in and out of traffic going anywhere from 50-80mph. The guy in the blue car stopped next to me at a stop light and told me to gtfo out of the car and fight him. If he didn't have a fucking bat and 4 other people in the other cars I would've done it and gotten it over with. But fuck that I'm not getting beat with a bat and jumped by a bunch of guys all at once. So I told him I'm not fighting him and to leave me the fuck alone. Doesn't listen. So I speed off yet again and thankfully some good Samaritan in a pickup truck saw that I was running so he pulled in front of the car to stop him, but one of the 2 cars still following me managed to get around the truck. So finally a cop pulls me over for driving crazy and I explain what happened, and as I'm doing that one of the cars is driving by! So I point him out to the cop and as I do that he rolls down the window and says ""your dead motherfucker"" and made a hand gesture like slicing my throat. So the cop was cool about it and let's me go and says he will take care of it. IDC if he takes care of it or not I just don't wanna see those fucking crazy people ever again. Sorry for the wall of text. 

TL;DR-crazy guys chased me in cars waving bats, had to call cops to get them away because there was 3 of them and they wouldn't leave me alone",q0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Since the majority of us opiate/oxy/dope users constantly face the risk of law enforcement I figured it was time we had a thread to share our experiences with the law/police. Perhaps we can even include some helpful practical information so that the less experienced users have a better idea of how to handle themselves in situations.

Please remember to not post any self-incriminating/ self-identifying information. Alter names, locations in your stories so that they are falsified from the truth thus keeping you relatively anonymous. 

As far as my history with law enforcement goes I've been arrested once for drugs.  That one time they caught me with a bundle of dope, several dimes of coke, and needles. Luckily it being my first offense I got off with probation and had to pay several hundred in court fines plus private attorney fees. As far as the actual arrest goes, I had just copped the dope/coke from the corner I had been going to for a few months straight. This corner was in one of the worst parts of a semi-large city on the east coast, the city as a whole isn't that prosperous although it does have some good things in the center. Anyway I left the hood and got on the highway to go back home to my area. On the highway I was speeding a bit and tailgating cause I was in a rush, although it was rush hour so I couldn't go that fast. Maybe 5-10 miles after i get on the highway from the hood, all of a sudden these unmarked dodge SUVs swarm up behind me with the red & blue lights on. Normally when a cop pulls you over it takes them 30 seconds sometimes even a minute to get out of their cars and walk up to your window. Well this time they were up to my window in like 10 seconds and they were all plainclothes detectives. They knew where I came from too. They told me they were gonna search me and my car but knowing my rights I told him, ""No I have to consent to that first."" He agreed, and said either you consent to search or we call K9 and if they pick up a scent we impound the car and get a search warrant. So I consented, they found the stuff and that's the story. Looking back I shouldn't have got on the highway directly from the hood, I should have driven over to the good part of the city and gotten on highway from there. Cause let's face it cops racial profile people all the time, if your white and driving through a hood/ghetto they're gonna assume your there for drugs. 

Let's hear your experiences/ insights...",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 post: This question has been on my mind for some time now. I've been an IV heroin & coke aka speedball user for 4 years now and have relapsed over 5 times. Ive overdosed 1 time and also had cellulitis in my arm from dirty needles. Been arrested once before for drugs as well as been banned from retail stores for shoplifting. Stolen thousands of dollars from my family and former employers. Have almost 15 days clean now and I notice recovery has been getting harder and harder for me the more i relapse. 

Also I know many other addicts some of whom have progressed very deep into addiction and every time those ones try to get clean it never lasts.  For example, my one friend has been shooting heroin & coke for over 7 years. He has been to 9 rehabs always relapsing within 3 months after his release. He has also been arrested 4 times, the most recent arrest was for robbing a convenience store with an illegal handgun. He was caught 2 weeks later and served around 1 year 8 months. I feel he has progressed to far for recovery to ever work.

Lets face it addiction changes you. It changes your personality, your chemical balances in your brain, your values, your norms. How does an addict get back to having good values when addiction stripped them away? Your thoughts are welcomed.",q33,0,1,"3,5",0,5,0,0,0,0,7
OnTheNod,OpiatesRecovery,56784z,10/6/2016 15:31,0,2,"title: Fighting the temptations at 8 months clean .
 post: So today I have 252 days clean (8 months 8 days). 5 of those months I spent in a behavior corrections facility or ""TC"". I'm also in a drug court probation program. My alternative sentence is 7 years w/ an 85% in state prison. So its safe to say I take my recovery very seriously. I'm involved in AA. I have a decent network, a sponsor, I'm on the 4th step, I go to 4 meetings a week, I also chair 1 of those meeting and, I go on speaking commitments usually once a month. I really try to follow all suggestions from my sponsor and network, because before I thought I knew better and did things my way. Well look where that got me - a 2nd degree felony conviction, drug court, 2 overdoses, fired from 4 jobs,  went to 4 rehabs, 1 halfway house and, 6 outpatients. So I've been trying to get this recovery thing for a while now. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


The frustration I'm having now is due to the temptations/ thoughts/ triggers I'm feeling. I'm on the Vivitrol shot so I don't get thoughts or cravings for dope, which is nice. However my drug of choice was speedballs so I still get thoughts about shooting coke. Like sometimes when I have a strong coffee and the caffeine effects me I'll start recalling the high of shooting coke. Its not like I choose to recall the high it just happens randomly when I have too much caffeine. One of the ways I've tried to compensate for not getting enough pleasure as before (when I was shooting dope & coke) is that I watch a lot of porn and I try to feel some pleasure that way. But its never satisfying enough, I always end up wanting more pleasure which leads me to think of shooting coke. I should probably lower my expectations of how much pleasure, euphoria I can experience while being drug free. Its just hard though cause my brain still craves that rush, that massive release of dopamine. I could try and meet some girls and have sex but that makes me nervous cause the last time I had a lot of clean time (1 1/2 years) I relapsed because a relationship ended badly. So I'm aware of how much getting involved with girls and relationships can mess with a persons head during the first year of recovery. I get pleasure/euphoria in other ways too like from buying things or watching my favorite sports team but its not as intense and instantly gratifying as shooting coke/ dope. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I'm sure lots of you could probably relate. I know what I'm doing is trying to replace one addiction with another, which isn't necessarily healthy. However this is where I'm at in my process so the best I can do is share about it, seek advice and take the right actions to move forward.",q0,0,0,"1,3",0,5,"26,0",2,0,0,0
OnTheNod,OpiatesRecovery,586zw6,10/18/2016 19:03,0,2,"title: Proposed Sabrina's Law in NJ .
 post: So the other day I was listening to the radio in NJ. This woman came on who was spreading news about this proposed law she is lobbying with Legislators to pass. Its called Sabrina's Law (named after her daughter who OD'd & died on dope). The law would allow concerned family and friends of addicts to contact courts in order to get the addict committed to a rehab facility. So in other words, the court system can mandate people to rehabs regardless of whether or not you have committed a crime. All they need is a testimony from a family member or friend that confirms the person's addiction problem. Sabrina's mother said the thinking behind this law is that ""when people are using drugs they can't make good decisions, so lets enable families and courts to make the decision for them and get them the help they need sooner."" 


Idk about you guys but I oppose this legislation. I support addicts getting help and going to treatment but you can't always force them to. Every addict has their own process and progression, they need to get to the point of desperation where they'll have a genuine desire for recovery. If you commit addicts to rehabs when they aren't ready that will only foster animosity between the addict and family. I thought this was an issue worth discussing. Also I don't support involving the government more and more in peoples recovery....we already have drug court isn't that enough? ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I found a bottle of oxycodone 5mg IR at my in-laws house, and decided what the hell why not. I popped 4 of them (20mg in total) and here I am an hour later with the most godly euphoria o could imagine. I finally found the drug which gives me the high I've been looking for. I also picked up a few Vicodins from them which I'm going to try tomorrow. Anyway, I'm so happy right now and just felt the need to tell everyone here. 

UPDATE: I've decided to keep the pills, but I'm going to slow down and think for a while before I decide whether or not to try it again. Thanks for the advice everyone.",q0,0,0,0,0,"8,2",0,0,0,0,0

 post: I'm going to be getting a gram of #4 afghan and a half g of FS cocaine later this week.

Can someone with a .001 milligram scale please measure out an amount of powder heroin equal to a small regular household item (i.e. Pinhead or match head) and let me know how much it weighs in milligrams? Same with cocaine if anyone has some. I know they'll be very similar, but slightly different densities will mean different milligram weight.

I have done both of these drugs before but I figured it's better to be safe and know exactly how much I'm doing. I know the coke/heroin won't be pure so I'll stay on the safe side when dosing using your measurements.

 post: Hey everyone, I've recently acquired 15 OxyContin Old Formula 40mg. They're stamped with ""EX"" on one side, meaning they're the kind made for Mexico. Unfortunately these were discontinued 15 YEARS ago, so I'm wondering how much potency they've lost and if they're still even safe to eat/snort. They cost me $400, so I'm going to be pretty pissed if they've lost potency or are unsafe... On a similar note, I also got 5 roxycodone 30mg A215's (the good ones, super lucky) and I'm wondering how long I could potentially save these before they lose potency or become unsafe to use. I might now have another chance to get A215's again ever, and I don't want to waste the best oxy I'll ever get my hands on.  Anyway, thanks for the help!

 post: Every thread I've seen about lean (codeine with promethazine) on this sub has been shut down because lean is such a weak opiate and considered to be useless. I completely disagree with this notion. In fact, my first ever opiate experience was with ~120mg of a relatives prescribed codeine and APAP syrup, and it was wonderful. Since then I've become a rather seasoned opiate user, (hydrocodone, oxycodone, heroin, oxymorphone, hydromorphone) but my first experience with codeine is still one of the most euphoric things I've ever felt. Since that first time I haven't had the opportunity to try codeine again, but recently I decided to buy 8oz of Canadian syrup, which is much stronger than American lean (Canadian is 16mg codeine per 5mL). I haven't picked up the 8oz yet, but I'm just wondering why you guys hate lean so much and if it'll even do anything for me with the tolerance I have (80mg-100mg of oxy/H snorted). Should I pop an oxy or two before I start sipping? Any other tips to enjoy this expensive drink? Also, if you're strongly against lean, please explain why instead of just saying ""lol lean sucks try something stronger."" Thanks everyone!

Has anyone tried actually EATING heroin and did it do shit? Also, what do you think my dope might be cut with if it burns like fucking hell when snorted, cooks up cloudy, and smells like paint thinner and hardware store chemicals? Thanks all!

 post: I've seen a lot of posts on here about people's fun/stupid/unbelievable stories, so I thought I'd share mine. So I use DNM exclusively, and though I usually make my money legitimately, I was desperate last November and needed a fix badly. A well known vendor contacted me asking if I'd be interested in being one of his reshippers (I had dealt with him before and he trusted me at this point), offering me 100x 80mg mundipharma OC80s. Well of course I'd be an idiot not to accept, as he also offered over $8,000 a month, so I gave him my address and he shipped me the oxy from Europe (I'm in the US).

 A week later I got the OCs, all 100 of them in blister packs of 10 (I still have the blisters as a souvenir). Well of course I wasn't there i wasnt going to reship them, so over the next month, until Christmas Eve, I used about 2-3 OCs a day in addition to a few grams of fent-dope. On Christmas Eve my family found the oxys, about 30 of them left, and I was busted. I felt like a complete shithead, especially since it was Christmas Eve and my family is super religious. 

They hid the pills, and the next time I was alone I searched the house and found them hidden in the garage. I really wanted to resist but I couldn't, so like the junkie I am I kept on taking them out of the hiding spot one at a time, thinking no one would notice. At this point I had come up with a crazy story about the pills being a friends and that I didn't know they were under my bed (I'm 100% sure my family didn't buy it), and when I finally got caught taking one of the pills out, I denied it still and said I was just taking them out to flush them. What kind of an asshole am I to lie to their faces after I've been explicitly caught. I'm still not clean and my family has dropped the issue and still thinks I'm using it can't prove it. 

Anyway, it gets better. The vendor knows I scammed him and has been sending me messages on the DNM and letters to my house telling me he's going to CALL THE COPS. I call his bluff so he starts sending me packages containing an unknown white powder which I obviously never touched. I think he's forgotten about me by now but for a while I was scared shitless about some thug knocking down my door and killing me on the spot.

I met you in adolescent ignorance, and it was love at first sight. Our first night together was the best I’ve ever felt, and nothing else mattered in the world.

 post: ***EDIT***Pictures added***

I was in the hospital today to get my head and chest x-rayed as I apparently blacked out around 8PM last night and fell and hit my head several times. One time caused a nice gash on my forehead and now theres blood all over the floor and walls in my house. Anyways it took two emergency room nurses over 5 minutes (one on each arm) to find a single shitty vein to draw blood from which of course blew the vein but I told he to keep going she's not going to find a better one. 

If they don't think I used to bang from just that they probably do now when I asked ""What gauge needle is that 23?"" Which is when she looked up at me with a puzzled face and said ""ummm yea how did you know"" to which I responded ""just had a feeling."" 

So yea pics soon to come of the gash on my forehead and my left ear which is so bruised it's black. I feel like I've been in a car accident. 

Moral of the story don't slam 8 beers then think ""Oh I'm totally fine might as well take like 10mg of benzos"" seriously don't do it. This is the first time I've ever blacked out no matter how drunk I've gotten (I'm talking like 2 handles of whiskey and still knew what was going on, I mean I couldn't move but still) so now I know how scary it is when people say they've had that happen.

 post: Hey everyone long time no post. As of October 12th I was officially two years sober and in that time my life has had its ups but mostly its downs. I waited to post this to make sure I go through the month. Even though it has been a tough couple years for me I've managed to stay strong and for the most part positive. One thing that has helped greatly is the alternative addiction and support group I started running. Unlike other support groups around my area I utilize tools of the botanical variety. I give out for free Kratom, Kava Kava, CBD and other such things to help my members stay clean or get clean. I have noticed a really good result because of these practices. Anyways I'd like to thank some of you guys in here for being awesome and talking to me when I'v been having a rough time and just keeping me on track. 

So if anyone needs some advice or just simply to talk to whether it's about getting clean or just how your day's going send me a message. Everything we talk about is 100% confidential so you can feel safe. I know one huge key in recovery and hell just life overall is having someone to be able to vent to or just have a conversation with. So to make up for the less than desirable person I was when my using got bad I'd like to try and help out whoever I can. 

So yea, if you want to just shoot me a PM and I'll be glad to talk to you.",q0,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I've gotten to know the plant inside and out over the past year and I'd like to spread the goodness with anyone who's trying to get clean or struggling to stay clean. So if you have any questions I'm your guy! Let me know either here or in PM if it's personal and you don't want everyone reading it. ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

But with him being a middle man now and having to wait on his guy (another long story) it ended up being a shit show and I waited for 2 hours and ended up calling and telling him don't worry about it and that I have to go because I was already late as fuck getting home to get my kid. So a minute ago he calls and says he's got them in hand and he'll call me back closer to time for me to get off. So now my hopes are sky fucking high...

 post: Alright boys and girls i need some advice. this post is probably going to get a little long winded.

So i've been doing opiates since like 2006 or 2007. i moved to a new city 5 years ago. when i first moved here I worked with a guy that would sell me his extra tabs each month and that was about all i could find besides boy and i really didn't want to start doing that again so i just took the tabs when i could get them and got roxies whenever id make the 6 hour drive back to my home state. So eventually we had a new guy start at work (we'll call him S.E.) that could get pandas. id only ever heard whispers about them when i lived down south. literally no one i knew had ever seen one or done one so when this guy told me he could get them i got one and fell in love. 

So i dealt with this guy as my middle man for like 2 years and everything was straight. Then he started getting sketchy and doing a lot of dope. he ended up ODing at work and i had to grab his lunchbox and find his shit and flush it while he was getting narcaned in the middle of the shop. so he got his job back because it was a union shop and he used fake piss when he came back and had to take a drug test lmao. (that doesn't have anything to do with this post really, its just a story i find funny as shit #ThanksUnion) So eventually S.E. owed me a decent amount of money and we got into an argument and it ended with me backing him up against his truck and telling him that he was going to give me my money OR he could introduce me to his dealer and id forget about the money. so of course he took the free option and then i started going through his guy (we'll call him T.W.) which was great for about a year. so here recently ole T.W. went to rehab, then when he got out he decided he was going to sell pandas and not do any dope since he'd gotten the vivitrol shot and couldn't really get fucked up anyways. So since he hadn't been to work in a while he was broke so he couldn't re-up and be an actual dealer so he was kind of a middle man. id meet him and then we'd go to the plug (we'll call him B.B.). id buy 5 pandas for $80 a pop and then T.W. would get like 10 for that amount of money because he was getting them for like $40 or $45 a piece. i didn't really complain because he was my only connect and $2 a mg isn't that horrible of a price for pandas. So iv'e seen B.B. and hes seen me a few times but we've never talked. So after a month T.W. started shooting meth and became ridiculously unreliable. now hes fallen off the face of the earth. His phone is off and i cant get a hold of him. So last night i searched through every one of his face book friends and i fucking found B.B. So iv'e been to this guys work to pick up from B.B. when i was with T.W. and like i said the guy has seen me multiple times but we've never talked. so here's where my need for advice comes in. Should i just show up at B.B.'s work (furniture store) and  buy a piece of cheap furniture from him and then bring up the fact that i know T.W. and try to talk him into serving me or should i message him on Facebook and see if he'll respond or call me? He always seemed a little sketched out when i would show up with T.W. but i guess that could have just been from me and T.W. being white boys and just pulling up to his house or work in the hood lol. but yeah guys i'm not sure which option is better or if i should just not even approach the guy at all and try to find a new hook up. i know if i was a legit dealer and some random dude id only seen a few times messaged me on FB id probably just ignore it or block the guy. so i'm worried if i message him on FB he'll block me and then kick me out of his work if i show up there lol. i just feel like i'm so close to having a decent hook up but still so very far away lol. but yeah so what do ya'll think? what would you do if you were in my shoes? Thanks for taking the time to read this long fucking post and responding. Stay safe out there fam.

TL;DR my middle man vanished but i found his plug on FB and i know where he works so should i message him or show up at his work and try to get him to serve me?",q1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Hello all, currently about to start day 3, last used about 1 1/2 pounds of poppy seed for a tea.  I've been using multiple times a day for over a year.  I cannot do it any longer.  I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything, without knowing I have seeds around.  This will be the second time I'm really trying to get off of it.  Not counting the time I successfully did it 3 years ago.  

Anyway can't sleep, and feeling really emotional.  Currently working on an immodium taper, because I cannot deal with the vomiting, which I get REALLY bad during w/ds.  And I work a pretty demanding job, which I simply couldn't do if I'm dry heaving all day long.

I know about the insomnia, and the RLS, and the aches, and the sweats, and the depression, and the anxiety, as this is not my first time being without the drug, but my first time I do not intend to use at my first opportunity in a while.

I should also add I'm smoking marijuana as it allows me to eat.  I'm at at 24mg dose of Lope, I started out Tuesday night at 36 mg.  I plan to reduce 4 mg each dose til day 5 where I half it til I'm at zero going in to the weekend, just in case I get any delayed withdrawal symptoms.

Just making this post to see if anyone relates.  And if anyone thinks I will in fact be in for a rougher time this weekend because of the lope usage.  Thanks for taking the time to read this if you have.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"12,9,0,11",0,0,0,0

Anyway on day 3 of coming off a pretty serious PST habit.  I used Lope to taper, took 8mg this morning 830am, then 4mg before work at 5pm.  I didn't really want to take this dose but I was really afraid of getting serious gastro distress in the middle of work.

Back home now, physical symptoms seem...pretty non existent?  I'm assume this is the Lope.  I'm just dealing with real bad depression right now, like can't stop crying/worthless/shit for brains/waste/burden/ etc.

Before my opiate issues I took Wellbutrin for depression which really helps, my plan is once I'm through day 5 or so to see a psychologist and get back on some mood medication.  I didn't do this before quitting because I knew if I got prescribed Subs, I'd be setting myself up for another battle.

Just posting this seems to help, almost like a journal which others can respond and input on.

I'm planning on possibly taking 2mg of Lope tonight to help me sleep, but I'm not sure, I might just drop off from 4mg because the bowel stuff scares me.

I asked in my original post but does anyone think I'm gonna be in for a rough time tomorrow with no further Lope?  Last opiate use was 1.5 lbs PST Tuesday 5pm est, after an accidental taper with some less than proper seeds.",q15,0,0,0,0,0,"9,0,11",0,0,0,0

I was considering not continuing but if this could be helpful for anyone then that would be more than worth the effort.

Anywho I've been using PST, about 2-2.5 lbs of Seeds a day, depending on quality, for a little over a year.  Every day, no tolerance breaks, just a few accidental withdrawals when FEDEX fucked up lol.

I've been meaning to quit for a while, but couldn't take time off work to get clean.  I had once mega dosed on Lope when I couldn't get seeds, and while it was miserable it did trade ~80% of W/D symptoms, for a aching upset stomach, but no vomiting, which was key for me.  So I knew if I was going to quit the Lope method was an option.

The previous posts document my lope usage, but as of right now last Lope I took was 2mg at ~4am this morning because I had HORRIBLE RLS.  It did...nothing, lol but I didn't really expect it to.

On the symptoms side my emotions are an absolute wreck, but I made it through every night of work, and did it all with zero vomiting and stomach cramps which is easily the most debilitating symptoms for me.  Night sweats/clammy skin all that jazz have been pretty much non existent as well.

In both my other posts I mentioned being worried about a delayed withdrawal due to the lope taper, but it seems I somehow dodged paying the piper, or at least shorted him a tenner on a dub.

To all reading this looking for help or inspiration you CAN do it, trust me if I can, anyone can.

To anyone who feels this is clogging up their feed, I apologize, the first couple posts were definitely for me, but the further will hopefully act as a testimony for anyone curious.

That's it!  Any input/comments/discussion is great!",q0,0,0,3,0,0,"19,11,10,17,0",0,0,0,0

 post: Hello everyone!  Tomorrow marks 1 week since my last 2lb dose of PST.  Symptoms have been managed with Lope for the first 2 days, and then nothing stronger than an ill advised couple Benadryl on day 3, and a few advil.  

Had real bad nausea last night, wasn't really anywhere near puking just, felt queasy.  And I was wide awake until ~6am when I got REAL tired.  Great I thought finally some sleep WRONG, brain said perfect timing for some R....L.....S!!!  I used to only get it in my legs, but this time it's all over, arms, legs, hands, feet, torso???  Whenever it got unbearable I'd hop in the shower, while it gave me some relief for a while, sleep was just not...coming.

So atm I'm like 30 hours without sleep, and the 2 previous nights consisted of about 3-4 each.

Does anyone have any advice on something that can help me sleep without aggravating the RLS?  I have been doing hot baths/shower, serious stretching before bed, trying not to eat anything as sometimes caffeine and sugar can make it worse.  Benadryl makes it much worse for me, don't have access to Benzos, and melatonin has also made it worse for me in the past.

Thanks all keep on keeping on!

PS: Got in the car last night, turned on the radio and heard ""I wish I knew you when I was young, could have got sooo high""  I thought it was rather apropos  for my current situation

 post: 11 days since I quit a daily PST habit of 2 1/2 pounds a day for about 2 years.  I'm having a few potential issues I'm a bit worried about.  

One of the times I cleaned up in the past, of an oxycontin habit of 80-120 mg a day, I went in to a bit of a manic episode.  It lasted about 3 weeks and fucked me up bad, I ended up being misdiagnosed with Bi-Polar, and was so ashamed about everything that happened during the episode I didn't leave the house for a while.  I was convinced I was now broken, flawed, less than whole because of the diagnosis.

Anyway about 6-7 months after I finally got out of my house to get help from a psychiatrist.  After our meeting she was convinced the episode was due to the opiate cessation, perscribed me some wellbutrin, and I was great for about...6 years. 

Long story short, got dirty again, now clean, have had zero desire to sleep the couple nights, something that happens during a manic episode.  I also found myself getting more easily aggrivated at work, and almost blew up on an employee of mine.  Because I know the symptoms from last time I cooled myself off.  Does anyone think this is related to the opiate quitting again?  I plan on seeing a psych the week after this, unfourtunately traveling this week.",q15,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: What's up OR fam.  I'm currently 15 days clean off PST and wanted to post an update.  Insomnia is starting to fade, restlessness no where near as bad, and the bit of mania I had last week seemed to have passed.  Right now my main issue is memory.  Things I should definitely remember are not foggy like when on opiates, but more like just absent.  Hoping I didn't do any permanent damage and it will come back.  Second issue is my guts.  I have like 3 out of 10 nausea all day and haven't had a solid movement in 10 days(used Lope taper to quit.). Any ideas when I should return to normal?  Immodium not an option because I don't like that it's a opioid, because anything that is there's a good chance I will abuse in a moment of weakness.

Thanks all it you read this, this sub has been really key in me cleaning up, so thanks again to all you lovely people.

Keep fighting the good fight.

I have the worst headache of my life achey and chilly, when I'm not feeling on fire.  My guts also are, not great. I guess I forgot what getting sick is like?  I used to be good for 1-2 sinus infections throughout the year but those seemed to have gone away while using opiates.  Also my chronic heartburn is back with a vengeance after stopping.

 post: 5 weeks off a pretty heavy PST habit, getting back in to therepy and had some concerns.  I've lived with depression since I was about 19 and have been on and off diff ssris and anti deppresents, and felt I had enough clean time to get a baseline intake done.  I've been super depressed the past few days (went from my normal 4-5/10 to 8/10), could this be a symptom of PAWS?  Also I'm considering going back on welbutrin which has helped me in past clean periods.  Question is, will this affect my PAWS timeline?  If I take it and it doesn't work well and I stop, will I have w/d symptoms?  Any advice or knowledge would be great.

PawneePatroleum,OpiatesRecovery,8w46n9,7/4/2018 15:12,0,2,"title: Happy 4th OR Fam! (First post in a while, just over 4 mos. clean) .
 post: Hello Everyone!  Haven't posted in a while, and happen to hop on this account.  12 year off and on opiate user with ~3 years as longest clean time, coming of my longest everyday using time of 2+ years (starting 300g poppy seeds/day, going to 2.5lbs seeds/day)Throwing this out there for advice, encouragement, and the sense of community I craved and needed when first getting clean.  

My last few posts have been about GI issues, I was being a baby and thought my body should be back to normal after just 2 mos. clean from 2 years using.  Idiot.  Colonoscopy clean, Endoscopy clean, I got these done for piece of mind, because I was going to the bathroom 6+ times a day every day, and wanted to make sure something wasn't seriously wrong.  It wasn't.  My body was abused.  Just wanted to say those looking for a timeline **I have had a solid BM once a day for 3 straight days!**  Maybe I'm lucky, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Main ways I've been able to **stay clean.**

1) **Support group.**  I have sober friends I can talk to (one has 7 years off opiates), I have close relationships with my friends again (the ones who don't use).  And I can talk to my family about what I'm going through again. 

2) **Psychologist/Psychiatrist Meds.**  I know Meds aren't for everyone but wellbutrin has been a godsend for me.  Also I think having a trained professional tell you what your brain is going through during recovery is super helpful.  You never know if what you're reading on the internet is anecdotal.

3) **Staying busy** Work, exercise, women, sports, games, self cranking, books, movies, TV, etc, etc.  Do ANYTHING to take your mind off it.  This is most difficult during the beginning stages but definitely worth it.

4) **Change your habits/lifestyle**  Again this one is difficult during early stages, shit it's difficult always.  If you are behaving the same way you were when you were using, it's very easy to fall back in to it.  Your brain will be very quick to remind you of the good times you had doing just what you're doing now, all you need (insert substance).

5) **Play the tape all the way through**  This one might have helped me the most.  I used to see someone fucked up and get super jealous, and wanna be there.  Again.  That's the addict brain.  Now I make myself play the rest of the tape, and visualize what that guy/girl/zim is going to be feeling like in 8 hours (broke, hungry,sick,suicidal etc.)  More often than not that helps me.

Sorry for wall of text.

**TL-DR**
GI issues better now (4 mos. clean).  Love this community.  Love all of you doing well, and all of you struggling.  Keep it up, stay clean, you're worth it.

ANYWHO preamble over, I had got some weed from an excoworker in preperation for early withdrawals because I'm a baby, didn't know this guy at all from when I was using, just heard he dealt.  Well few nights ago he texts me looking for codeine cough syrup and he's got a ton of percs to trade or sell...He's got no Idea I've got an issue, and I could feel the neurons in my reward center start firing.

 post: Today I have one year removed from an addiction that should have taken my life, and took a large part of my soul.  In the last year I have transformed my body through yoga and weight lifting.  I got a promotion at my job, resulting in a much higher salary.  I have also worked very hard in trying to repair the damage done to my psyche through years of abuse, drugs and otherwise.  As I sit here now, all I can think is why.

Why did I do any of this.  Why did I put all this work in.  Why try to get better when it is your brain that is broken.  I will always be a sad, shell of a human, doing anything and everything to make the people around me think otherwise.  

As open as I've tried to be about everything in my life, the thing I most want to talk about, is that which is verboten.  You simply cannot discuss addiction of any kind without being classified, pitied, or even worse, championed.  I get sick to my stomach when people congratulate me on being clean.  If they only knew the shit I did while using, there is no way I would be being celebrated.  

So I come here looking for support again, just as I did about a year ago today when I got clean.  Won't be responding til later on tonight, have to try and get some sleep.

Beating the shit out of my mind and body is NOT worth it for a little perceived relief.

It's weird, the basic victories, but the days I sleep or go to the bathroom normally are awesome. Handling a bad headache with something other than an opiate makes me feel stronger. Taking a long walk makes me proud of myself.

PhilaDopephia,OpiatesRecovery,3qjtg2,10/28/2015 8:07,0,2,"title: 365 days, in a row without cheating or lying. Today marks 1 year of Sobriety. One year of having confidence in myself to become everything I want to. .
 post: I want to start off by saying (sorry it's long) this whole community is amazing. We have people come and go and come back and we never falter, never get frustrated. We are here to support people in some of their worst times, we cannot save everyone... but we can provide a moment of compassion when sometimes even their loved one's are unable to. This is an awesome subreddit where we get to help people we don't even know.

Last year I checked myself into rehab for the 2nd time, almost a year exact from the first time I went to rehab. This time was different as people were keen to my bullshit. I was voted house leader, or as the staff tech's there called it ""king of the retards;"" I think they put me in this position because I had low confidence in myself. My counselor used to ask me to say positive things about myself. I don't really know where I'm going with this other than now, a year later.. I'm starting to think I just never thought I could do this. I could never pay bills, have a place to call my own, have Sixers season tickets (haha) or really just do anything productive. I lived to get high.

My first month or 2 out of rehab I opened up Google Calendar and I scheduled every single thing I was going to be doing for the week, and I stuck to it. If there was more than an hour of ""watching tv/playing video games,"" I was finding something to do, even if it meant sitting with family. I did meetings a lot in the beginning, did a 90 in 90 and I slowly faded after that. I think the most important thing other than being honest is I structured my life again. They say it's a process to become an addict, it's a process to get clean. I had to train myself to live a normal schedule and now it's just habit that I know exactly what I'm doing and I'm never laying around moping. I really think the schedule held me accountable for slipping in the first few months.

I really hope we all, myself included... can figure this whole thing out. We as addicts find it hard sometimes to listen to other people, seriously take a suggestion. In early sobriety a lot of it is actually listening to other people and trying their method since mine obviously didn't work. Continue to be honest and snitch on yourself if you have to, things will fall into place. I didn't do anything special besides give myself a chance. 

Thanks for anyone who read that, and this whole community. Definitely one of my favorite places to check during my day. Have a blessed day.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: Hey guys,

I just wanted to say I love this community, there is no judging and it's crazy you can get so much love from some people who you will most likely never meet. You'll have people lift you up that don't even know you. This is a beautiful place and you all continually make a difference. Thank you for that.

I have two years sober today, I don't really know what to say... time has really stopped being a thing. I probably won't celebrate again til 5 years. It just seems pointless at this point to congratulate myself as it has really become a routine.

I do want to say there was a time in my addiction that I would cry leaving the block and think to myself ""why do I keep doing this?""  I used to tell myself that I have done the damage to my brain and I can never truly be happy. I will say that all that shit is wrong. I hated ""life beyond my wildest dream"" saying, I never understood truly wtf that meant. I do today, shit that I never even knew I wish I had... I have. Things I never knew I wanted to accomplish, I am, or have. 

Sobriety is fucking crazy. 2 years feels like 10... and it keeps getting better. People say they'll never stop thinking about getting high... I can say about 99% of the time I'm not thinking about it. I'm keeping myself busy, and I have my eye on short goals that I've set for myself. These goals are continually increasing in difficulty and one day I hope to have a house for my family and all this crazy shit, that if you knew me 2 years ago would never think I could accomplish. 

I could keep going, I could write a book right now trying not to work on a Friday. If you're just starting out I'll part with.. give yourself enough time for things to change. Give it your all everyday, prove anyone who thinks you'll never be shit... wrong. I'm nothing special, just someone who decided I was done fucking up. YOU CAN DO THIS.

 post: One my my best friends growing up passed away yesterday. We grew up together and this kid really was special. It's disgusting that things like this really do seem to only happen to good people. He always lifted people up and he had this weird big brother vibe for all of our friends, I think it had a little to do with him being held back in 6th grade. That's when I met him, first day of homeroom and we spent the rest of our school days together.

So many sleepovers, so many days wasted on the basketball courts, teaching me about girls. This kid really could have played D1 Ncaa basketball if drugs hadn't derailed him, which makes me think how many other amazing athletes just never make it because of life decisions. We started to split toward the end of high school.

We never used together but we were both hopeless dope fiends at the same time but never talked. I got sober in 2014. A year later we reconnected. I helped get him County funding to get into rehab. As soon as he got out he relapsed and went to jail. After jail he seemed to be doing great. He probably had close to 6 months. Working as a Barber and looking/sounding like his old self.

Yesterday I got the call. I guess this ""keeps it green""... it could be me, it could be any of us. It only takes one time, which is apparently all it took him. I miss you already Joe. Mix the memories of you and the nostalgia from growing up and this one hurts the most.

 post: Hey guys, I have been busy as hell today with taking my son to the Zoo and running back in time to take my daughter to her Soccer game, things I probably would have been a day late and a dollar short for just 3 years ago. 

3 years ago today would be the first day in rehab that I didn't take a suboxone and was fully off any type of narcotic. I had ruined a lot of relationships and was on the brink of losing my job. I was addicted to heroin again after my first stint in rehab got me almost 6 months of sobriety.

I got out, did the meetings.. did the IOP even though I thought it was stupid as shit, since most were court ordered, but I finished it, and that was a small goal that was easy enough to complete... just twice a week show up somewhere, easy enough. It was small goals in the beginning that gave me the confidence to start making bigger goals.

I think the most important thing is honesty but a close second for me was habit/process. I had a habit of getting high every day and it was my routine... it took a process to create a new one. I started scheduling my weeks in google calendar. From the moment I woke up til the time I laid down for bed, and I stuck to it. Eventually that came my habit and honestly what I do today isn't very much different than that original calendar I made way back then, if anything a little more busy.

My son was born about 9 months into my sobriety, and I pray he'll never have to see me that way. I have achieved so many things these past 3 years I would have never dreamed I'd be doing. I was addicted to opiates for almost 10 years and in the beginning of 2018 a bank is going to give me 250k to buy a house. I don't know what my goal will be after that but I need to keep moving forward.

Don't feel like you've made things too bad or that you'll never reach a certain level of happiness again... hard work and honesty will take you places you won't believe.

 post: Yesterday was my 4 years sober. I used to be one of those people who thought the dopamine levels in their brain would never be fixed and I was doomed to keep using in order to be happy.

Today that is no longer the case. It started one day at a time and being honest and telling on myself. If Friday nights were hard for me and I would think about getting high I told people in my life I couldn't be alone on Friday nights. It was definitely a process and lots of meeting in the beginning.

I don't go to meetings currently and have just recently moved across the country. I will admit I feel disconnected with recovery as a whole. I feel like I forget what it was even like to be an addict. Shit kids these days are doing drugs I don't even know about lol. I've been on the fence with going to meetings again (haven't in about 3 years) in my new area but, things are going well.

This shit takes the withdrawals away but it is almost not even worth it. Sometimes I can do half a bag or 2 bags before I go bat shit insane.


Why can't we fucking get real dope, I have been using for the last 10 years but only Dope the last 3-4 but I have never experienced this insanity. What the FUCK are they putting in this shit. I guess I can say that I am thankful they are because now I don't even want to do it. I don't want to blackout and go insane to maybe feel better. If it was real dope that I could get sure I am all for it. 


Is this Flakka? What is going on? Am I losing my mind? I can get blues all day but they are so pricey that I need like $300s worth to even have fun and that shit goes in 4-5 hours. God damn it I wish this shit was legal so I could work and do it safely. I would be a perfectly functional person in society if I could go to the store and get it. 


Do dope dealers realize that if you are giving us this flakka shit or whatever fent bullshit that we are just going to stop doing? I feel like I am taking crazy pills over here!! Bring back real dope or I am just done with it. Done with it all!


Edit: Forgot to tell you how I got in trouble with the law. I was in a blackout episode apparently screaming like a lunatic in a bathroom and the cops were called on me. This would have never happened if I had real dope. I never had any trouble doing dope before but now I can't hide because I will go into this crazy state that everyone knows and sees that I am drugged out.",q1,2,0,"1,3",0,4,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Recently I've developed some sort of rash consisting of hives-like itchy spots starting around my underarms then my elbow/knee creases and then all over the place in varying degrees.

It looks like a ""heroin rash"" from what Google images tells me but I haven't used in around 3 weeks and it only appeared around the time the h would have been leaving my system so I'm not sure if there's any correlation. Benadryl seems to help so it's probably some sort of histamine reaction. 
Does anyone have any experience with this or thoughts? Should something like this stick around so long after use? If not a reaction to heroin what could it be?

 post: For some background I’m 19 and have been using IV heroin for over a year (not consecutively) and daily since early October 2017. I’ve used a variety of drugs to self medicate for depression since early 2016. Since going cold turkey a bit more than a week ago I’ve hardly had any cravings for the stuff. What gets to me is that opiates are by far my favourite class of drugs and yet the only serious cravings I get even when dopesick are for alcohol, which I can’t stand.

Essentially what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can I control myself pretty well with a drug that I really love and have been using consistently for a longer time and yet only have that addict drive for dirty alcohol?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I’m having an ok time getting away from daily opiate use but I’m just baffled by the fact that I’m more driven to drink. I wouldn’t mind continuing to use opiates and benzos in moderation (key word) in the long term and set up a good system, I just really don’t want to become a drunk again. My alcoholic phase was my lowest point and I never want to repeat it.

Also if the blood is trapped and pressure builds you can get a false register from squashed blood vessels as you move your rig.

Halfway through I went to my truck to get some change for a drink and locked my keys in. I finish playing and running through my mind how I am going to be able to afford everything. I had $42 To my name. I'm only on my 2nd week here so haven't received a check. I bit the bullet call a locksmith and give him what I have. He unlocks it and leaves. I get in to drive away and click, nothing, won't start. I fuck with it for hrs, had people try and jump it off and still nothing. Some guy pulls up to help, and does so for at least an hr. Took me to the parts store to check the battery and all. We determine its the starter. But I am still stranded 45 min away from my room with no way of getting back to my truck if I do make it to the hotel. The guy walks away and comes back to tell me he called a tow truck. I tell him how I can't afford it and he tells me he already paid for it ($150). I'm completely stunned and cannot tell him enough how thankful I was and that he really didn't have to do that. So I ride in the tow truck still trying to figure out how I'm going to get to work and make it through the week being completely broke. I get in my truck to get it off of tow to find $200 in my cup holder. This random guy snuck it in there. I got his contact info earlier so I call him. I tell him how he did not need to do that and that I will get it all back to him on Friday (I make decent money, just in a tight spot) and he tells me no, this is a gift and he does not want to be paid back. It has been quite a few years since I have seen any generosity like that between complete strangers, it has restored my faith in humanity.

 post: Hello R opiates. I am a longtime lurker but finally felt the need to get this off my chest. It all started two years ago when I got my new job an a union Ironworker. If any of you work physical labor, opiates enable you to work harder and longer. Immediately I relied on them as a crutch. Your classic addiction cycle began and now two years later I can't go more than 6 hours without starting to become sick. 

I still have the luxury of living at home, with my parents and I have to say I am so not were I need to be in my life. I have pissed away thousands upon thousands of dollars. I have no bills to pay besides the essentialls such as car,credit card,cell phone,food etc...and it's such a shame seeing the amount I have saved up compared to what it should be.

For the longest time I knew I could not sustain this lifestyle, but I genuinely was only concerned about were my next high waa coming from. Now my future is the driving factor in getting clean. I want more than anything to be free from these chemical shackles. So that is exactly what I am going to do.

I have given myself off the rest of this week and next week for work, I'm going to hunker down and get the absolute shit beat out of me with these withdrawals. But I know it will feel AMAZING to be sober. I kicked before for 7 days about a year ago and I regret ever getting back on. I no that's no large amount of time but I know what's in store for me the next few days of agony. I have access to Xanax,lope,magnesium,lyrica.  Definitely going to use them liberally. 

I'm so scared, but I'm ready this time. I have never admitted this to anyone ever in my life. This is the first time I have put this down in writing..by all means I was a functioning addict...but fuck that shit.",q0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Hello Reddit, all my life I have been enthralled by drugs. May they be illicit, or completley legal their various interactions within the human body has always intrigued me. I can vividly remember my first experience with opiates. Thirteen years of age, two full bottles of tussionex. Heaven.

Fast forward 8 years, I have tried every drug you can possibly think of. Was able to avoid any physical addictions or health complications. Until I landed my first ""big boy job"" This was a job that paid very well but was extremely physically laborious. So I reached out to my old friend Mr opiate.

Oxycodone was his name, at first a welcome friend to my days of hardship. He made me warm and fuzzy, energetic, hopeful. And for a while it seemed like I had the world by the balls. Until one day slowly without realizing it, the tables had turned. My doses slowly escalated as did my need for oxycontin to be entertwined not only with my work but daily activities outside of work.

Two years went by and I was making close to 1500$ a week living at home with my parents, paying close to no bills.....with a bank account running on E. Oxycontin was no longer my friend, but my lifeblood. I needed it more than food in the morning. I can remember countless days choosing to obstain from eating in order to get another pill. If I did not dose every 5-6 hours the chills would set in, and I knew just how screwed I truley was.  This behavior went on for a while until I reached out and went to a Suboxone doctor.

 I knew this was simply trading one addiction for another, and I'm not one to advocate using narcotics with potentially even worse withdrawal and addiction rate than the very pills I was so desperate to escape from. But, suboxone gave me my life back just almost to the point were I wanted it.

My bank account skyrocketed, I was much more level headed, I was able to maintain and grow a beautiful relationship with my partner. But in the back of my head I knew that eventually there would come a time I needed to get off the Suboxone as well.

Over a period of six months I went from 14mg-2mg. Until without my doctor's supervision or knowledge decided I had enough of the shackled and jumped off the subs at 2mg. First week was absolutely horrid, my bed and no sence of hope. Second week more of the same. But from day 14-now day 36 it has been a steady improvement.

I genuinely feel like I'm almost back to who I was before the opiates took over my life. And this goes out to anyone out there who knows they need to bite the bullet. I PROMISE you, that not being chained to a pill or strip or powder is the way to go.

 post: Hello reddit world !

Long story short, 4 years on oxys/vikes etc.
Classic love at first sight, which turned into a battle just to feel normal.

Tried to cold turkey approx 8mg sub last year went a month clean and I just couldn't bear it anymore.

Two weeks ago I gave a short 7 sub taper a try. I switched to kratom for about 2 months.( was previously on sub). Using about 30g of kratom a day to maintain so I had a bit of a heft habit. 

Took the subs for 7 days, still felt a bit strange during that time. Probably the kratom withdrawal under the subs. I am now 7 days clean from the subs. I can honestly say compared to cold turkey this was a BREEZE. I have been able to eat at least a bit every single day. My sleep has been decent fragmented but there.  This withdrawal was maybe 2/10th the strength of just going cold turkey.

So my advice is do not use sub long term unless your ready and willing to taper very slowly and truly have the self control to do so. I highly highly advice this to anyone who's ready to quit. It's been 7 days since my last sub and I feel almost 100% PHYSICALLY normal.

Obviously the mental aspect will take time, but anyone who's interested or has questions feel free to shoot me a pm. This should be much more well known and utilized ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"1,0",0,0,0,0

Life while still very far from perfect, is going in the right direction. My personal relationship has improved. My clarity is improved. My relationship with my family has improved. Able to actually save money and work towards financial goals.

To anyone out there who is on day 1 week 1 week 2 etc. I know how INSURMOUNTABLE it seems. But I PROMISE YOU if you just STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM OPIATES, and have a vision of what you want your life to look like. It WILL fall into place. I could never even imagine this far and would always envy people who had 100+ days clean. 

Now I am one of those people, and you the reader with a bit of grit and hard work will be too. I look forward to reading messages similar to this when I'm at a year clean etc. So much love everyone. No matter where you are.

 post: Well it all began at around 12 years old when me and my best friend scored some vicodin and ventured down the unforgivable path of highness. I could take 30 mg and nod off, sweating uncontrollably; which would be something that I would chase for the next 9 years. Throughout high school I had many friends and a social life outside of getting high, which soon would disappear. I graduated from vicodin to oxys and everything else mind altering. I was more of a pillhead than a opiate user and would take anything to change my state of mind. I started losing friends because I would isolate myself all the time, steal, lie, cheat. Everything that I did not stand for. I lost countless incredible girlfriends because I would always be high when I was with them. Ones that would help me quit and stick by my side but I would always do them dirty and ruin good relationships.
By the time I went to college (a very good one at that), I was taking 150 mg of oxy just to catch a little buzz and ended up blowing so much money throughout my 4 years to get a biochemistry major. During this time, my best friend I started doing pills with committed suicide which left me so very alone but at that time I was pushing him away as well. I had spent around 2 grand a month on drugs and now am struggling with loans. I did graduate just recently last year and am grateful for the help my family is giving me after I stole from them and lied to them my whole life. 
Just last week however, I got a new outlook on life. I always knew I'd either die before I was 30 or something lifechanging would happen. It's sad to say but true. I got into a car accident after blacking out and crashed into a pole going well over 55 mph 2 weeks ago. Brain contussions and bleeding was severe as I sat in ICU. The pain meds they gave me did not help at all because I abused them for so long so I was in brutal pain and going through withdrawals such as the tingling sensations. I ran out of my meds soon after I got out and am continuing to heal up, find a job and change my life around. It's been 4 days since I did any opiates and hope I can continue to stay sober. It is boring but I couldn't keep living like that and disappointing everybody in my life. By the time I stopped doing opiates I could eat a 100 ug fentanyl patch and be normal. Shooting dope soon followed and it got really bad but now i'm clean. 
I always had somebody there for me so it was not as bad as it could be but hurting those that I truly love in the end pushed me in the right direction. I want to become a lab researcher for the CDC and work with virus' or something along those lines. ",q0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: I started doing drugs when I was 13. Just pills occasionally. Went to college for biochemistry when I was 18 fresh outta high school and constantly partied. Been a thief, a cheat, a liar, a fool. That's for damn sure. Used everyday around 200 to 300 mg of percoset and graduated to fent patches sublingually doing 2 100 ug patches at a time. Good times right? Hell nah. What a powerful drug when it can steal your soul. Heroin was fun for the time being, I'd chase that high right before I nod out and my lips turn blue. Had had friends save me multiply times, snapping me out of it but I continued to fuck around. Got into a car accident last august and fractured my skull, hematoma, and a rib broke and went through my lung. I healed greatly and was actually sober for a while. Man did I enjoy that time and I look back on that as what I want for my life, I have my biochemistry degree now but working at a call center to save up and move to a region that has better careers for my passion. I am now quitting again after screwing around, going to rehab and getting out only to get arrested for a dui cause i passed out in my car after shooting up. Court in 2 weeks, got set up for an outpatient so my judge and lawyer knows I am at least trying. 

The biggest problem I have is that I owe 100 grand in student loans and probably around 5 grand in medical and dental bills. That just seems to suck me into using because I say what's the point; I am never going to catch up but while using I won't. That's the truth. 

Starting all over now. Day 3. My withdrawals are never really that bad besides the sleep problem but I just take two extremely high doses of loperamide each 48 hours apart and before I know it i'm clear of the withdrawals but then my paycheck comes and I fuck up. I'm really going to grow up. This time I am focusing on health and meditation. I really want to grab my soul back from the depths of hell and bring it back into the present world where I can focus on bringing joy to other peoples lives and making a difference one day at a time. Going to start running everyday and hitting the heavy bag/jump roping. Really helps me out because then I wouldn't wanna use to fuck up the progress I am making on my health.

Well sorry for the super long text. Just wanting to let some of it to really convince myself I want to do this. My mom has done absolutely everything for me and I always fucked her over, she cries at night wondering if she will get a knock on the door at 3 am saying that her son is dead.

 post: Little background: Started using any pharmaceuticals at age 13 and immediately loved it. I used because I did not feel comfortable in my own skin and wanted to be someone else. Thus grew my fascination with pills and booze. Got into two serious head injuries over the course of the next 10 years and OD a few times. I needed to get my shit straight. I was stealing from the closest of friends; robbing my parents; and casing college book stores. What a trip. I never imagined going to rehab. My first trip I knew immediately I would use as I got out and I just wasted my time and insurance money. Went to AA and NA as suggested but I was still getting fucked up. Then I lost my home, and everything that meant anything to me. My soul was gone. Shooting dope became a urgency as I'd wake up frantically and call everybody trying to find someone to rip off or some way to score. Used to hook up with women in college and introduce them to this terrible disease and most of them are still struggling (guilt trip). But I just got out of my 2nd stint in rehab today and my mother is sooo supportive. I am now 23 and feel like I need to get it right this time; I know I do not want to pick up. Will go to outpatient and meetings as much as I can. Just got my second DWAI before rehab and lost my license so it will be hard but I need to take my time and slowly reintegrate into society so the stress does not overwhelm me. I love all you guys and I hope you make the right decision in going forward to remove this disease. It is truly progressive and every time I relapsed it got much worse. Peace and Light folks.

 post: So today, I experience my oh shit this is no joke while meditating. I can compare the blissfulness and content to that of a heroin shot. Even better in my mind. The rush of warmth was unfathomable; I spaced out. No thoughts, no ideas, no concerns. Just blank consciousness. Then I passed out and woke up 2 minutes later feeling like the king of the world. 

I have meditated on and off, usually when I had a steady supply of heroin. Was doing a bundle a day but now im 24 days clean and focusing strictly on my psychical health (lifting/cardio) and mental health (meditation). Well today I sat in my room, usually takes me 10 to 15 minutes to completely focus my thoughts on my breathing as I do mainly concentration breathing. Well a breakdown goes of the first 10 minutes, focusing and centering myself. Then about 15 minutes in I can get into a cyclical rthyhm (some days). I do complete nasal breathing as it differs and whatever is most comfortable. My mouth just gets super dry doing it through my mouth. As I take a deep breathe in through my nose it begins in my stomach and fills that and then slowly goes up the spin and into my lungs. Hold it for a second, exhale and it travels out of my lungs and down to my stomach. Like a cyclical pattern. Well unbeknownst to me I got stuck consciously in this pattern and did not recognize my body and could not feel my extremities. Well once I opened my eyes (very reluctant), I stretched and laid down. Completely spaced out, no thoughts, nothing at all. Complete warmth and content with life. Passed out for about 2 minutes and then just laid there in complete relaxation. 

It is like an art form, takes practice and trying different methods. I started with guided meditations but I feel like that took my focus away from my breathing. Well just want to let you guys know it really does help. I have always had a blank canvas in my brain and really don't ponder much thought so it is rather easy for me. Some people might have a more difficult time. Inner worlds, Outer worlds on youtube is a great show that'll get you in that mindset to really go for it. Love you guys. ",q0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

And take away all these pills

Guilt, shame, stress, and fear

Obsession is just one rich thought

I never learned what was taught

Was all my life, oh sinking sand

God left me to rot in flesh

Oh what i've done, he wants me next

Lied, stolen, cheated, blamed

life will never be the same

always woke up to alarms

stick the needle in my arm

constant hell, im left alone

burned my bridges, now i'm home

in the dark, dwell my soul

i am lifeless, i am cold

i was but a dying rose

spoiled, rotton, and decomposed

i leave you with my misery

im withered deep inside of me

please forgive this selfish act

i hope your lives are still intact

i wish youd never get that knock

i know youve prayed and cried all night

but what ive done is not alright

 post: What a ride. Things have gotten so much better though.

The first shot was shortly after my best friend committed suicide on October 31st, 2010. 20 years old and gone way too soon. He was the one person I could trust in this world. I was always addicted to pills from as early as 16. Emotional growth stunted. Only friends I ever had was the ones who would just sit around, drink, pop pills, smoke but never had any hobbies that will help one grow. So after my friend died, I was already at about 150 mg of Vicodin a day. Cue the heroin. I will make this quick, I don't like to romanticize my past because it was awful. 

Got drunk one night and decided I will shoot up. So I drove completely wasted to a friends house and shot up. Nodded out, decided to drive back home and was all over the road. Could have killed someone. Holy fuck was I selfish. Car behind me, pull into a random drive way. Nod out, wake up at 5am thinking I killed this poor family. This was the state of my mind. Few years of shooting up dope and I was stealing, lying, kicked out of my parents house, treating girlfriends like shit, and was just a morally corrupt person. Evil would be the right word. I did manage to graduate college with a biochemistry degree but I never ran out of dope because of a side business. Started becoming sick more often and wanted to die. Losing jobs left and right. I was purposely shooting up over a bun a shot with my buddy hoping secretly that I would die, I didn't want this life and I was trapped. The final time, shot up and nodded out. He pushed me in the backseat and drove as fast as he could to his house so he can leave me and call the police. He didn't wanna get arrested. Cop gave me a sternum rub and brought me back (this was before narcan). I went back out, woke up with my whole family crying over the hospital bed. What the fuck was wrong with me. Why was I so selfish and not considerate of the people that raised me and gave me everything. 

On to rehab, it was my second one. The first one I planned on using as soon as I got out and I did. This one I wanted to but at the same time, I can't do this to my mother anymore. I got out and started working out everyday. I got really into meditation and yoga. I just wanted to be someone different, a better version of myself. I lost 40 lbs from running everyday and lifting. Fit, happy with myself.

A few months later, I landed my dream job working on robotics in a biotech company. It was the one thing I  had wanted in my life and I got it. I still have drug dreams 3 years later and honestly, I have no thoughts about going back to that life. It does take time but fitness was definitely the key to my recovery. I am an addict to the bone; in relationships, in life, in being happy, in being sad, in health and fitness. I watch what I eat, I work out daily, I need to meditate more but all with time.

So life is good. This may not be too motivating but listen, I am 26 now. I would have gotten nowhere the past 3 years if I didn't stop. Now I actually have 15k in my bank account. I was always negative and living paycheck to paycheck. That alone gives me hope. I was doing drugs since 15 years old. Watched over 6 friends die and lost some family in the process. Life is hard but let me tell you, it's a lot fucking harder when you are chasing a high just to mask your problems. 

Most recently, I ruined a relationship with a girl I really cared about. She was probably the first girl in my life that was a decent human being. It's so hard to trust people still and I doubted her motives. I mean how can she be with a guy that is so evil. But that's not me anymore I say to myself. I try my hardest to be a better person but sometime the addict slips through. I want things a certain way and when they don't go that way, I get all bent out of shape. Things don't become perfect over night but they stop getting worse. 

This is a poem I wrote in rehab and posted her about a year from being sober. If anybody needs any help at all or just wants to talk about their struggles, I am more than happy to give you some hope. Just remember, it's one step at a time. Getting off it is the hardest but the longer you go, the better your life will be. Don't you want an SO and to live a better life. Your family doesn't want to bury you, that's a nightmare. Be smart if you are gonna use but try to see the light. 

Love as always

 post: Hello all u guys from my favoritte comunity

I have been a heavy heroin user for a year now, and for the last four months I have tried to quit a handfull of times without making it past the first day. I am using with my girlfriend, but this is the first time I try to quit alone. My supply is two mg xanax and two mg etizolam, along with 100g kratom.

I am 13 hours into this hell, so that is a good start. My girlfriend is using several times a day right next to me, so I need some help resisting to ask her for some. Also, other things that worked for you, I really need to know how I’m gonna be able to do this. If I take a small shot in the middel of the withdrawls, how wil that mess with the timeline?

 post: Hi, again, fav people
Thanks for all the good stuff on my post yesterday. You guys help out so much I might not even be breathing anymore if it was not for you amazing fucks. So yesterday, on day 3, I went to buy a bag, but my dude know we trying to stop putting money in his pocket so the mf gives me four bags for free, cool dude, right? No, cuz now I’m going back to buy 10 more because those four bags put us back a hell of a lot and we are not ready to start all over.

Not sure what to do from here, the plan is to only split one bag every day, haha yea right, we propably gonna find some reason to do 3 today, and hey we can afford one more, right? Well not really, but I’ll just take some from my fucking best friends card, cuz he too spaced out to pick up on it. If I where to follow that feeling of What I really want, I would just slam all of them in one go, and never have to deal with a single thing ever again. Hell, it’s been a year since I was declared dead, but that narcan, I can’t make up my mind if I’m glad I woke up. I was not at the time, and I don’t look foreward towaking up in the morning eighter, mabye silence is better than these depressing and fucked up thoughts I walk around with.

Be safe out there, and for you out there still just curious, please, never do this thing too often, it’s like a prison where you get tortured from time to time. You gotta find new ways to get a pass from the fucking pain, and even when you are in the clare, the clock is ticking, you better prepare yourself, because if you are not ready, you might just wanna shoot up 10bags at once instead of facing that week.

 post: Sup, bropiates

Thank you so much for all the tips on my post yesterday on how to prepare for rehab. I survived day 1 (today) easy, I have no idea why I tried to do it myself 50 times when I should have come here right away. They make the W 80% better, I am at day 3 of W  but it feels like day 1. I think they gave me something to make my adrenaline chill, and that killed almost all symptoms. Yay🎈

I have a solo room so I only see people at the smoking spot, no one wants to talk or even look at me for some reason, and there is nothing to do but sit on my phone, alone, all day. But that is beside the point, I wanted to make this post to encourage people that can’t seem to do it alone, but are hesitant to try and get help, to just give it a shot.

Bonus question: What are some stories from when you where treated? Would love to hear about other peoples experience.

You propably don’t read it or whatever but I made a post about taking a smal shot in the middle of my wd, and I am soo glad I did cuz yea I had to start the wd all over but it is like 1/3 painfull so I am actually enjoying myself. I mean it is still shitty but not to the point where I can’t function, and that makes me able to do some normal erryday stuff.

To the point tho, I can’t remember last time I felt so much, like I am listening to music and crying, on dope I would often go around with headphones no music cuz it did not really make me feel much anymore. And I saw stranger things s3 today, full on laughter like whoa I had forgotten how my lafter was besides yaknow ‘heh’.

Also real quick, I read that paws last like a long time, can someone fill me inn on what it really is and how long it takes or whatever? Been on iv heroin for four years.

So when I was 9, I was given tylenol with codeine (don't know the street pill term for it), and I was allergic. I got the hives, and my breathing constricted. The doctors told me it was an allergic reaction and took me off of it.

Well now that I'm older and use drugs, I have always wondered what the hyper about opiates is about. I'm just scared to try them incase my reaction to codeine would be similar with other opiates. I don't want to ask my doctor this question because it would seem sketchy.

 post: I admit I only have limited experience with tar/gun powder (same shit right?).

Personally I always found it to be a much more a downer high, and never gotten that uppity feels like ECP may do. Like I said I've only done tar a handful of times.

So I am only asking those who have experience relatively equally with both for their opinion. Which is preferable? and elaborate and all that good stuff. If you think you have a bias for whatever reason explain too.

I can only say I prefer ECP because that is what I can primarily get and am used to.

 post: No one is telling you that you're going to wake up the day after you take them and think to yourself ""I need to do whatever I can to buy more oxy and nothing else in life matters now."" That's not how it works. Chances are, as long as you take enough to have the full opiate-virgin experience and get this easily obtained euphoria, you'll have a nice, deep sleep and the next morning you'll wake up with a bit of an ""afterglow,"" similar to MDMA, but with an opiate feel. You'll be fine then. The issue is that you will remember the feeling and you might even think, ""huh this was nice experience and I had fun, but i don't get why everyone on reddit was freaking out, this isn't really such a hardcore drug and is pretty subtle"" (like you have mentioned somewhat expecting.)

You'll go on with your life and continue with your so-called amazing self-control. You'll continue setting your monthly targets and goals, will achieve them, and will use some oxy as a reward every month or two. Again, this would not be a problem on paper. You'll be fine, as you say, you're continuing to avoid using more than you said you would and you haven't upped your dose, at all. You'll be ok.

The problem with this train of thought is that, the more you use them, the more your brain will link target goals -> working on them -> reward. This is how reward pathways start. Your brain will remember the good feeling achieved from the Oxy & you will have no guilt about it. ""It's really not such a scary drug like those guys from reddit kept saying""

This routine continues for say, a year. You stay on target & you dont stray from your dose or your schedule. Again, the routine is going to continue reinforcing pathways in your head, and the oxy will make it a much stronger and direct connection. Maybe one month you meet an extra goal and do it every two weeks. You do this again maybe 2 months later and take it twice again, only now you are starting to notice a dip in the amount of euphoria you are getting, BUT you aren't gonna up your dose because you're strong-willed, so you take some potenators and get way higher than you have been. You take the potenators everytime you dose now cause it was so nice.

THEN something in life happens that sucks really hard., like getting dumped by your longtime partner, you lose a great job you worked hard your whole academic life on getting, your mother dies from cancer suddenly, ANYTHING really shitty that you can think of. You admit to having anxiety and depression so you are familiar with getting in a depressed slump/rut, i'm sure. Now, after all that longtime planning and careful dosing of these opiates (that you haven't truly been respecting because you think you are stronger-willed than everyone else, remember) you decide to get some a week after you had last dosed. This new dose lifts you out of your headspace, but just temporarily. You go back to being down.

See where this can lead?? This is where the real danger in using opiates regularly lies (and yes using one every month or two months is regular). No matter how careful and ""strong-willed"" you may have be, you can't account for life throwing you a shit roll. You have already created these direct paths in your brain that lead to not just euphoria, but contentment, a lack of depression & anxiety, FEELING GOOD. It really isn't hard to justify further use with these drugs, ESPECIALLY when you use them as a reward. You will use again. And again. And again. It continues and continues.

But by all means, use them and think that you are in the extreme minority of people that won't get hooked on the feeling because you've used pretty much all other classes of recreational drugs before (just like 95% of us on here). The best thing that can happen to you when you try it is that you wont really like the feeling of being on an opiate.

Good luck, and please respect (and even fear) these drugs and where they can lead.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its decent dope but I cant help but feel like it gets wasted in my nostrils cause its not coating it, it just clumps up into boogers.

So whats a good way to fix this?? I want it to be nice and dry.

 He told me to go out to the house cause he stayed there the night before so I get there around 9am and notice some kids nextdoor waiting on the bus with their mom who gives me a weird look as I pull in the driveway so I try and look nonchalant on the walk to the door.

Lmao so basically this dude is trapping out his grannys house in a very standard middle class neighborhood. so I wait for him to bag up my shit while the gramma goes outside in her robe to smoke a cigarette on the porch and starts talking to the neighbor with her kids, I'm assuming to take attention away from the random white boy hanging out there lol. I get my shit and ask my dude if he wants me to wait a little so it doesn't look completely fucking obvious and he's like "" nah bro it's cool they don't care"" so I dip.

 post: So I got some dope & coke from the plug today, was super quick with zero waiting time, so everything was going smooth. He bags me up my shit and let's me try his new fire 🔥  ass dope which he gives me along with the coke and gives me my bags. 

He then throws me this extra bag, which was at least a grams worth if not more, and tells me, ""Here, take this shit too, cause you snort right? This stuff has a bit of this tea stuff,  you can use it like an opiate, it's like heroin.."" Immediately I knew it was kratom & said, ""Kratom is really weak, it takes at least multiple grams eaten or drank and it is literally dried tea leaves . That's not a good cut really."" He said he knew & he is only giving it to snorters cause he understands how fucked the dope is. 

He kinda got how kratom doesn't work thru the nose or smoked and he reassured me there was only a very small amount of kratom in the dope, but i could definitely smell it and see it as the dope had a slight green tint. So since I got it for free I was like fuck it, racked up a few lines. It immediately smells & tastes like heroin with kratom in my nostrils & I exhale a small puff of it too, cuz... kratom I guess. This deff works as heroin but god damn it is stupid as shit. Like now 75% of the users cant use it cause they shoot and it's just a useless cut in general. I told him it was wack and I wouldn't pay for that dope, and thankfully he got the message.

 post: So last nite after a long day of middlemanning and such I drop off my last person of the day off at a hotel. They throw me some so I decided fuck it lets do a shot? I proceed to do my shot fine and fast. As for my passenger, to say the least is struggling. Poking her self over and over not hitting a vein. After 20 minutes of watching her struggle she finally agrees to let me try to hit her so I repark. Im sitting there looking for a vien and what not and all of a sudden theres a flase of light in my eyes and I'm blinded. I look stupid. Like an owl. A deer in head lights. At first I suspected it was just the hotel staff telling us to leave but I was wrong. Oh so wrong. It was the local police department. First thing he asked was what are we doing. Now let us not forget I was in the middle of trying to hit a vien for my friend and had a rig in my had that I dropped on my side and also my passenger had a tie off around her arm. None the less the officer ask for my license ( I dont have one. ) so I hand him a state I.D and tell him it my license. Thats not his concern. His concern is about my eyes. ""Sir why are you and your passengers eyes watery?"" A wave a confusion hit me not knowing how to respond. He didn't know if we we're on drugs or crying. He ask over and over if we had been drinking. Lists every drug imaginable and asked if we have done any. Then finally the question comes. ""Any heroin in this vehicle?"" No never officer. He heads to his squad car. Im thinking its over doneskis. Fucked. Bamboozled. I cant help but think how to get out of this one. I swallow my heroin hand the rigs to the girl she shoves them in the deep dark unknown. I'm on the verge of running. Heart beating like a NASCAR race. Cop comes back come up to the window. ""You have no business here, I suggest you take your friend home."" The officer walks away. Im shocked, in disbelief about what just happened. How we didn't get searched when we were obviously getting high. 
We leave back to bitches house and watch her poke herself 2000 more times before I say fuck this and make her get out so I can go home. Im almost mad at her because she can't just shoot herself up without stabbing her self more then O.J did his wife. Anyways glad I'm on reddit and not in jail. I gtg to work now have a good day.

My question/concern is when I started using (18) compared to now (21) it seems like there is no true heroin so to speak of. When I lapsed this time around I have been realizing that most of the dope I've been using just isn't the same high as it used to be. I can tell its fent.

 post: Just a warning, this is really long. I needed to vent. I talk a lot about drugs and I'm sure a lot of it could be a trigger for people so don't read on if that's a problem.

Night time is always my hardest time. I'm a pretty closed off person in general. I haven't used my DOC since Wednesday, I'm not gonna say I have 3 or 4 days clean cause I don't, I'm still using cannabis products and about 20mg of hydrocodone a day, atleast that's what I've used in the last 24 hours. But yeah that's better than 120-160mg+ of Oxymorphone, 150-300mg+ oxycodone, or .5-1mg ECP a day. So I'm chalking it up as a win to be where I'm at today. I've been in withdraw fairly hard for sure I know it's a lot better than cold turkey. Oh, also used some weak barbs at night but they don't do much, a dab does me better. I have 4 Barbiturates, 15 7.5mg hydros, 4mg bupe, and some tramadol although I've found the jump off from my Loritab better than my tramadol. I'm gonna try and get thru the rest of this with those 15 7.5mg and some bud.

I've been doing drugs since I was 14 or 15. Did some pills here and there around 16. Had a kidney stone at 19,  got prescribed 20mg oxy every 4-6 hour and told to stay on top of the pain. 6 weeks of bliss insued. Even when my dick was pouring blood I didn't mind so much because I was numb. I left work and went home and hung out with my roommate. I sniffed 8mg dilaudid (roommate was prescribed and we traded), chewed 40 oxy, smoked bongs and drank 2l of water until I was about to explode. After that we started buying OC 80s cause I loved that feeling. ODed on 240 mg of oxy some benzos and booze and some other shit one night. I had just started taking celexa and I've always blamed that. I've been on narcotics pretty much all my life, started amps in 1st grade ended up on so much ritalin I talked to a potato lunch, amphetamine psychosis. Got switched to some BS than finally adderall.

I quit for a while after my OD.  Went cold turkey with the flu I was dumb back than. I stayed off a few months than chipped a while. Stopped for a while to save up to move to FL. Get there and within 4 months I was smoking 30s everyday with a coworker. I decide to move back home after 8 months of this to get clean. Move in with a friend who hates opiates. But I'm home I have tons of connects. I get back into shit, and start using again. Meet awesome people, meet shitty people but my networks grows and grows and I have fantastic connects at this point.

 I have a soft tissue disorder so I've had to have a few surgeries on joints over the years. I have a messed up back from a few car wreck. In autumn 2013 I totaled my 2011 car while ill in a rainstorm. Got my dealer to come to me since he was leaving on vacation and got fucked up in my totaled car, on the side of the highway right after causing 30k+ in damage because of this stupid disease. I say that cause I was going much faster than I should have been for the conditions and am honestly lucky to be alive. I broke my wrist and now have slight scoliosis of my back because of this,  I hit a guardrail at 50mph after losing it at 85 mph and almost flipping at 60. I was rushing to my dealer.

My money was still straight at this point, and I got a big payout from insurance without a rate hike. I got really lucky, I'm also kind of a piece of shit because of this but I've gotten used to looking at myself this way. There's literally so many lows. Anyway, I went out and bought a 2014 luxury sedan. I end up backing into a car on NYE. Drunk, on a lot of oxy and benzos, and my friend convinces me to take off. Is this my low? Nope, of course not.

By this time I'm dating a ratchet bitch. When we started dating it was awesome. She sold pills and was great at sharing and I covered us all other times. She got me into dope too. She's the one that convinced me to buy it the first time, I'd done it a handful of times over the years but never actually bought it. Starting buying Gs of fire from her cousin and using generic 40mg opanas other times, sniffing 3 or 4 or 5 or more a day. She starts smoking and crack and shooting, something I could never do. I break it off. She owed her dealer a lot of money at this point. I get propositioned to take over and of course say yes. I fuck that all up. You can't trust an addict with hundreds of 15s and 30s and 40s and kpins but fuck that was a fun couple months. That left me with my fantastic habit I've had.

It's funny, my last time hustling up cash at the pawn shop actually pawning my own shit for a change and I get fake pills. I was at the end of my rope. I really don't think I have a rock bottom, other than this, except for death and that kind of terrifies me. I think I've wanted to get caught because I was starting to realize this fact. When it was all totaled up I owe the pawn shop over $4000,  sprint over $1000 for iPhones I bought just to flip, paypal $2,000. I've really really fucked up my entire life at this point. When I was 21 I was getting 1k every month from a trust, had a fantastic job with a major tech company, was living on my own and thought I knew it all. 

I could never understand how someone could get to this point when I was younger. I saw friends strung out on dope and couldn't see how they could steal from their parents or friends. I've had roommates and friends do it to me. I thought I was in control, and that was my biggest problem. I've been on opiates on and off since 2004 for recreational use and no more than 5 or 6 days off since October 2011. I'm flat broke. Living at my parents, who are fucking saints. A good 3k of the shit in pawn is theirs right now cause I sold all mine. I sold all my gold, silver, bonds, cashed in an ira, stocks. I had enough in an investment account to give them to get their shit back, the transfer went thru Friday and I official have less than $200 to my name. When I was 21 I had a net worth over $100,000 and was making $65,000 a year. I have ~$5,000 in high end functional glass art I plan to sell to get myself out of debt, I don't trust myself with the money though. I've signed all my bank accounts over, my car loan over which I'm fucking thankful to have because on Thursday when shit hit the fan I agreed to sell it to not be homeless. I have had my carrier change my number, block access to my new number by my dealers. But less face it if I want to relapse I know where to go. Hell I'm prob cause Friday I could have either had 6 30s if I drove 30mins or 3 delivered. I chose to turn my keys, wallet, and phone over till my number was changed. But, all I have to do is get in my car and drive to their house. So I need self control, something I've never been good at.

I keep getting asked how I got here and I really don't have the answers. I've done a lot of research, at uni I studied neuropsychopharmacology for my major. I knew the risks and yet it didn't matter. All that mattered was my next high and later how to not be sick. It was a miserable existence. 

I've been a long time lurker here, I don't post to reddit often but I'm crawling out of my skin here and have very few people I can fully talk to without them crying halfway thru which I can't handle right now. I've been taking ever hour as it comes. I've slept 5 hours in 4 nights. Been up for 22 hours now and just typed this out on my Note3 since I don't have a computer or ipad or really jack shit anymore so I apologize for poor grammar and bad spelling and any other shit.

I know I am the lowest of the low with the shit I've done and it's going to take me a long to process everything and not hate myself. I hated myself before I was addicted to opiates, but my self loath is pretty high right now, like really high. I'm feeling suicidal like when I got that call anymore and haven't since about 2 hours shit went down which is good. I hadn't felt like that since I was like 16, what a coincidence.  It felt good to write this. I'm going to go smoke and try and sleep and I'll check this when I wake up in 2 hours, if I'm lucky. Lol.",q0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,0
WhatevaWhatever,OpiatesRecovery,2chamm,8/3/2014 0:56,0,1,"title: Another wild tale... .
 post: So I posted back in March when I was coming off of a ~300mg oxy habit. Got a mixed response due to tapering with hydrocodone, so I didn't really come back. I got clean, and started going to a therapist to work thru some personal issues. We dealt with my addiction but it was mostly about processing being sexually abused as a kid and my bisexuality, I'm a guy. I feel these two things helped lead me to opiate dependency.

Anyway, at the urging of my therapist I started going to NA meetings. I've done NA before, when it was court ordered and I didn't like it, so maybe I went in with preconceived notions. Anyway, I went with a friend to some meeting and stopped going after a handful. I never shared, I never worked steps, I never sought a sponsor. It felt like BS to me.

I had a small relapse in early June. I used for about a week, realized how stupid I was after the first trip to the pawnshop again, and went back to meetings. I shared this time, and I told my full story. It felt good, and I got some numbers of some people that helped. One was a guy, let's call him Steve, who I felt might make a good sponsor since he was fairly far along in his recovery. We started hanging out, going to meetings together. Life was good.

Well Steve reveled to me he was also bisexual and had been thru a lot of similar events in his life. A little background, I'm out and I know I'm bi, whether caused by sexual abuse or not it's what I am and I accept it. I've never planned on dating a guy, I've just never been interested in it. Well Steve and I started dating I suppose you could say, even though we only did the same shit I'd do withy straight friends, we were also fucking around. Now, I had been warned about dating another addict but Steve and I weren't dating and I knew better, like always.

About a week after we first hooked up Steve confessed to me he wasn't as clean as he lead on in NA. He still used occasionally. He was an IV heroin user, and shot about once a week and used about twice a week.

I'm sure everyone reading this can see where I'm going here. Even though oxy took me to the deepest trenches, I never shot, and I only did dope when absolutely necessary. After I found this that changed. I let him shoot me up, stupidly, for the first time in my life. I loved it, but I was way to afraid of showing track marks and being found out. But, for the first time in my life I was with a guy that I could see myself dating.

I used when he used, not more than two or three times a week, for the next couple of weeks. I don't know if it was the drugs, or finally feeling 100% accepted by someone, but I'm pretty sure Steve is the first person I ever loved. I'm 27, and I've had lots of girlfriend whom I felt I loved. Even one I used with regularity, but what we had was different.

I went away for a week in early July and when I came back Steve was in full on addict mode. Everything in my being was telling me run, but I didn't. I followed him down the rabbit hole. What I got was $1500 in debt to a pawnshop, and a little more than a half G a day ECP habit.

Luckily I've only been using everyday for about 3 weeks, but fuck. I'm 24 hours into withdraw and it's tough. I have to say I don't feel as bad, physically, as I did when coming off oxy. But my state of mind is in the trash. I'm not suicidal, but I'm the closest I've been to feeling that depressed again in almost 10 years. I feel like I can't go to NA, because I can't be around other addicts. Of course my therapist is on vacation, but luckily I'll see him Monday afternoon. He doesn't know I've relapsed. I just don't know where to turn.

I liked what I got at NA, I liked sharing my story and meeting people. Asa bisexual though I'm in a unique position of not being able to form a close bond with either sex without the possibility of it turning sexual.

So, I'm reaching out to you, you beautiful redditors, at least for now. If there's ANYONE with a similar experience, please PM. My heads spinning from a lot more than just throwing up right now. I'd really like some advice from anyone that's been in a similar situation.

I'm also curious about Smart recovery, and if you guys think group addiction therapy could be a possible substitute to 12 step. I need something more structured that doesn't allow outside interaction.

I appreciate any advice, I know this is a long post, but it helps me to write when I'm feeling like shit, and I'm desperately looking for some advise here. I know I'm stupid for thinking a relationship with an addict could work. But a bisexual with a history of sexual abuse as a child who also was a recovering opiate addict was just too tempting a life experience to pass up. The most fucked up thing? If I could go back in time I'd do it again, because I was able to share with Steve stuff I hadn't been able to say out loud to anyone, not even professionals because he's the only person I've ever met that understood me completely. My physical withdraw doesn't even feel as bad as it should because the psychological aspect of loosing a person I was that connected with is so severe right now it's killing me.

I chose to go there instead of going out to the bar with friends to see a band. This is my first time taking the total abstinence path, so I felt isolated but met some really cool guys at the meeting and got some numbers.

 post: Day 16 here. It's my first weekday not going to my IOP which is kind of weird. I don't feel ready to even cut to 4 days a week, but they said I'm doing so good that's it time. It's probably because I don't like change. I'm sitting in my GP's office now. It will be my first time seeing him since I red flagged myself, so I'm really fucking nervous about this. I feel like I am getting cold, but my throat is killing me so I wanted to come and get checked out since earlier this week my left lymph node in my neck was really swollen and painful so urgent care put me on antibiotics and now I feel way worse haha.

I haven't been sick in years, at least I haven't felt sick, other than withdrawals, in years. So this sore throat is a bit triggering right now. I'm sure my immune system is shot.

How's everyone feeling today?

It's day 20 for me. Tomorrow will be 3 weeks sober, which is incredible to me. This is already the most real clean time I've ever had without using illicit substances. Still fighting strep throat, which in early recovery really sucks. I'm staying strong though. I'm amazed how well managed my cravings are, and how normal I feel. Everyday has been getting easier. I know not everyone agrees with my recovery path, but for me it's the only thing that has worked. Recovery has been my main priority, and these boards really help me since so much of my time is spent sitting around at home, especially since I've been sick. I've just been reading thru my big book and reddit'ing all holiday weekend.

How about you guys? Anything exciting going on this weekend either recovery related or just for the holiday?",q7,0,0,0,0,0,"24,0",0,0,0,0

I had a good day. I'm 4 weeks sober, 28 days yeah yeah! Mom took me out to dinner to celebrate which was pretty cool. Today was my day off IOP so I had a relaxing day at home mostly. A friend recently was in a bad car accident where he was rear ended and it totaled his car. So I've been helping him pick out a new one and negotiate. I'm going with him Thursday to buy, so I'm looking forward to that. I'm clean another day and thankful for that!

For me, it's day 31. I'm looking forward to my blacklight home group NA meeting at midnight. I'm going to pick up my 30 day key tag which I'm really excited about. Earlier this summer if you told me that at midnight every Friday and Saturday night I'd be at an NA meeting, I would have laughed in your face. But, I've really grown to love my home group! I went to the mall and splurged a bit on myself after IOP today. One of my hobbies for a while has been sneakers, but while in active addiction I wasn't really buying them cause I was always ""broke"". So when I walked into the footlocker house of hoops store today and saw they were putting out a pair of kicks I've been lusting over, I had to grab them since I had the cash. Most would probably think they're ugly as hell, but I really like them and they sold out really quick after release. I had extra money because when I went to pay for my IOP after group today I found out I had an almost $350 credit with my rehab which should easily cover the rest of the month. It was really nice not thinking, ""oh I've got dope money!"" but rather I'm going to go walk around the mall and get a coffee. It almost seemed like fate. They had one pair of the sneakers I've wanted the most, in my size, I had the cash, and I just celebrated a month sober for the first time.

Went out with some friends yesterday and had fun, but was reminded how weak I still from the EBV. Skipped my home group last night because I fell asleep so I'll probably hit a random meeting today to make up for it. Right now watching my Ravens lose, and watching my fantasy teams be decimated by injuries.

But, I am clean, and life is good! Weather you're just starting off, restarting, or you have years of clean time, stay clean just for today. Don't give up on yourself, and keep your eye on that prize! We all can, and will, get our lives back in time. 

*edit* Holy shit! The fucking Ravens pulled that win out of their ass! Good fucking Sunday! This has me pumped up, and in a great mood!

I'm feeling good today, had a minor drug dream last night so I got up a bit earlier than usual this morning but I didn't let it bring me down like I usually would! Trying to move forward, and have another day sober under my belt. Can't wait to get some coffe and do some window shopping when I get out of here to kill some time until I get dinner with a friend.

I've hemmed and hauled about weather or not to go, but after getting advice from my IOP group, NA home group, and therapists; I have decided to go. All my friends know I am in recovery and will not be drinking with them. I have some Antabuse should I need it, but I don't plan on taking it. I feel like this will be a good test. Being so far away, reconnecting with old friends. Luckily the handful of people I used with in Florida will not be there, but the ones I drank a lot with will. I'm going to celebrate a union though, and look forward to actually remembering my trip and the wedding. This will be the first trip I have every taken sober, and I'm really looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to seeing people I haven't seen in two years, I'm looking forward to lying out on the beach and enjoying the sunshine, and I'm looking forward to checking out some NA meetings down there to see how they are.

 post: How's everyone doing today?

It's day 59 for me. Yesterday I had a big surprise; I graduated from IOP! I thought I had another week left, but I hit my 30 sessions, I actually did 33. So now I have my certificate, and I, feeling pretty good! My continuing care group is awesome! A lot of them have been with the group for 1-2 years so they have a really good bond. We're also allowed to have relationships outside of group, unlike IOP, so my network has expanded a little bit more. So I've now officially moved from the rehabilitation phase, to the aftercare phase. I still can't get other how different life is now. I am in such a better place, but since I was in such bad shape my program will be easing my transition. I'll still be going to my IOP group for the next month but only one day a week, and going to my continuing care group for one day a week. I'm excited because it's friday, so I have my home group tonight and tomorrow! I also get to handout key tags tonight which should be cool. I'll be presenting a girl from my IOP group with her 30 day key tag, and I'll be picking up my 60 day one!

I hope everyone else is having a good day! Stay strong, it really does get better. Especially if you put as much work into recovery as you did active addiction. I never thought I could recover. I had lost all hope and accepted that my addiction would eventually kill me, and I didn't care. I've foumd a new way of life, partially by focusing on my new associations. It's really important to build out a sober network. Doing that makes recovery so much easier. I know the weekend is coming up, so if you're struggling go and check out a meeting, NA AA smart etc. introduce yourself at the beginning and 9/10 someone will come up and introduce themselves after the meeting.

 post: How's everyone's Sunday going?

I'm at 105 days today. Currently freezing my ass off waiting in line to get a ticket so I can buy another pair of shoes this Friday. Been trying to pick up on hobbies like sneakers, movies, working on my car, etc. Shits been going pretty well. I have good days and bad days. Been in a bit of a funk since right around my 90 days clean. Having extremely vivid bad dreams, or drug dreams, 4/7 night a week. Some depression/anxiety but nothing like when I was using or in early recovery. My counselor is leaving my program which is unfortunate. I've really bonded with him over these past 3.5 months, but he's 9 years sober and has to do what's best for his recovery. Over the next he'll be transitioning us to our new counselor.

Still going to a lot of NA meetings. I've gotten pretty involved with the fellowship. I know it's not for everyone, and there's meetings I've hated and never gone back to. My home group is awesome, and I've met a few pretty cool people. Still do key tags at my Friday night homegroup, and I just started with HNI. Will be bringing meetings into a local detox facility the second Tuesday of every month. Got a sponsor, and working on a 90 in 90. Meeting Tuesday to start work on my first step. The first 30 days he just wanted to talk to me everyday and hit a lot of meetings. He's a cool guy with 2.5 years sober. Supports my personal recovery path and respects my doctors.

Anyway, it gets a lot easier. Life's so much fucking better now even on my worst days. Hang in there if you're stuggling.",q7,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: So it's Thanksgiving and I thought it would be cool to put a little twist on our daily checkin thread. In addition to commenting with how your day is, **what do you have to be thankful for today?**




It's day 110 for me since I last used opiates, marijuana, alcohol, coca in, etc. I've gotten out of little 90 day funk finally! Just been doing lots of meetings, therapy, step work, and hanging out with new as well as old friends. It snowed today for the first time that I've ever been sober. It was awesome! I felt like a little kid. Instead of dreading the snow; I had a great day! I wasn't shivering with hot/cold sweats, I didn't have to worry about running out to pick up, and I wasn't achy all over cleaning my car off and shoveling this morning. It was truly great.

First off, I'm extremely thankful for my sobriety. It's been a true struggle for me to get to this point. I'm very thankful for my family. I had lost them while in the grip of active addiction, but now I have them back. Our relationship isn't perfect, and I'm still working on building trust back. Our relationship is better than its been in a decade though, and I'm looking forward to having dinner with them tomorrow. I'm thankful for NA, my rehab, my counselor, my therapist, my sponsor, and my network of sober friends. I dove head first into recovery and I have tried to put as much work into it as I did being a junkie. Without every single one of them I wouldn't have been able to get to this point. I'm grateful for everyday I wake up feeling like a normal person. I'm grateful for this sub because it was the place I could come to to vent and hear from others trying to kick the habit while I was going thru withdrawal. I would disappear for months at a time, but every time I came back I was welcome with open arms. I'm grateful that this 23 time has seemed to be the charm. I'm grateful I was finally able to make it past the first week, the first month to get to the point where the haze began to clear and I was able to start seeing that I really could have a better life.

Anyway, Happy Turkey Day to everyone! I hope everyone at least gets a good meal tonight. If you don't have a place to go, if you're going thru withdrawal, or you just need someone to talk to; call your local NA hotline. I know in my region were doing a big dinner for anyone that doesn't have a place to go so they can celebrate with a hot meal. I had a shit load of reservations about NA for a very long time. I was court ordered to go to meetings when I was 19, and the only one I went to, 25 times, really sucks. A lot people trying to push their Christianity on everyone. There's bad meetings, and there's good meetings. I try and check out a new meeting every week. So far I've found 4 that I hit regularly. It's worth a shot even if all you get out of it is a few phone numbers. I had no sober friends when I stopped using, so I went to a friemds ho,egroup with him. I ended up meeting a ton of cool people in their 20s and getting a lot of phone numbers. NA, at least in ,my area, is a lot more laid back than AA and tends to have a younger crowd.

It really does get better, and you really don't have to use opiates anymore. Being sober isn't a cakewalk, and it's not all rainbows and unicorns all the time. But it's a fuck load better than using, for me at least.

I hope everyone has a happy holiday. I'm helping mom cook, than going to an inpatient treatment program to hangout and play board games with some of their patients, and than hitting one of my home-groups.",q7,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: Haven't done one of these in a while, but this sub helped me so much last year when I was at my bottom and suffering relapse after relapse and again once I finally asked for help and went to rehab. I was talking about you guys and recommended a new comer come check this sub out. I can't believe I'm 4 days away from my 1 year, and less than a week away from my celebration. I'm still a ways away from where I want to be, but it's insane how much better my life is today and how much I changed. Opiates brought me to the brink of destruction, and I truly thought my addiction was going to kill me. I finally had my aha moment, or what the NA sect likes to call my first spiritual awakening; I just call it a moment of clarity exactly one year ago today.I finally asked for help, and started being honest. Honest with my family, with my friends, with my therapist, and most importantly with myself. It was the first time that I truly accepted that I was indeed an addict, and that I couldn't do it by myself. A year ago this week was a whirlwind and this week will be too, but for totally different reasons. I just finished up my duties as GSR to my homegroup last night for the week, tonight I am chairing a friends meeting for him and sharing my story, on Wednesday I have my 1 year party at my continuing care group as well as my HNI commitment and finally I get to get my 1 year key tag at my Wednesday meeting that night, than Friday I have my 1 year anniversary with my homegroup where many of my best friends from the program will hear my whole story for the first time, and that's just my recovery related activities on my schedule. It all started right here with you guys though.

If your on day 1 or just struggling just know that it gets so much better if you just stick it out and put in some effort. Also, know the only difference between an addict with 10 minutes, 10 days, 10 months, or 10 years of clean time is one bad choice. I hope everyone has a fantastic Sunday!",q0,0,4,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

Recent use: Chipping lately with methadone to taper off after any individual sessions or often mini 2-3 days binges.  Thursday through saturday of the week prior I went on a bender with lots of shooting dilaudid and morphine.  Used 50 mg bottle of methadone from Sunday until to this sunday while staying abstinent of anything else for the sake of doing work I had to catch up on.

Today: I caved and did a bunch of shots of morphine and dilaudid while picking up the 70 mg bottle of methadone. I intended on just getting the methadone and taking a little to stay well a little longer then just freeze it and save it for next time.

I've recently started to volunteer once a week at an animal shelter, making a difference for those animals is an amazing feeling. 

I recommend looking around for a small local dog shelter stopping in and filling out a volunteer paper. I had a 1.5 hour orientation three days after filling out my information and was walking a dog by the end of it. Share some of the love you had for your dog with another less fortunate dog, I feel as if it will help. A lot of places you can just stop in whenever you have free time (after you have completed the orientation anyways). Just make sure to know your limit with dogs, and if you ever feel like a dog is or may be too strong/aggressive for you then let an employee of the shelter know, don't risk walking the dog. Even if you are dependent on dope or something you could still drop in whenever you are well and give a dog some love/a walk up the road.

 post: So I am working on a harm reduction device for people who use opiates alone and would be implemented with an Arduino (prototyping on an Uno but final product would be on a smaller board, benefit of this would be its also open source) that measures one or multiple of the following: pulse/heart rate, breathing rate, chest rising and falling (again checking if your breathing).

 The goal would be to sense an overdose using biometrics and either create a sound alert to try to get the person aware again, a message alert using one of the wireless or GSM peripherals or perhaps ultimately administer a narcan nasal spray. The sensors I have found that could measure these are as follows: pulse sensor, temperature sensor (placed under nose for breath) or alternately thermistor sensor which would be smaller but achieve the same result, accelerometer for chest movement or alternately inertial measurement unit (IMU) for the same application, flexible band belt respiration sensor/Fabric stretch sensor, sound sensor to listen for breathing, IR sensor (to measure heart beats), pressure sensor for respiration. 

I have no idea which would be best alone or combined to get the most accurate idea if someone is slipping into an overdose or has already overdosed. I do see projects people have done in the past that do similar things measuring breathing or pulse such as [this one] (http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2012/htq2_mg573/htq2_mg573/index.htm) 
made by people at Cornell so some smart mofos. Their device uses a thermistor sensor and has a buzzer when breathing rate gets too low and a different sound when breathing stops. 

My goal would ultimately be to have some sort of beeping if breathing gets too slow to give the person a chance to wake up and if breathing got way too slow or stopped it would somehow activate a nasal spray of narcan. I don't know if this is possible or perhaps too ambitious trying to administer narcan but at the very least there could be a noise to alert family or roommates or even a prerecorded message calling 911 using the GSM board (911 is free to call too so there wouldn't even be any need to put minutes on the SIM). 

I have had this idea in my head for ages and just got into Arduino's and saw potential to turn this idea into a reality. The device being open source means anyone could get the parts and make it themselves and even if it needed to be sold it could be made very compact with some of the arduino boards and could be as low of a price as 40 bucks as that is what the Cornell students project costs as a one off. 

Please critique the hell out of the idea, tell me if anyone would actually even use it, if you'd be afraid of it malfunctioning and narcaning you when your not ODing (my biggest worry) or it failing and not saving you putting myself at liability (would need to consult lawyers on that one, maybe make it a kit and not even sell it as a narcan dispenser). What you think about if its possible to even code something like this for all you coders, help writing the code if anyone is actually interested and passionate about the project, possible sensor combos that would ensure no accidental narcaning. Any input would help me so much as this has been something I have been building in my head for years and want to see it actually happen if I can. Thanks in advance.

 post: Well, I have a physical addiction to opiates that is a lingering part of my life. I still go to class, get good grades, but I feel ***no*** enjoyment from any of my daily activities (except getting high). While I am currently keeping withdrawals at bay with 10 - 20mg a day of OC (I was pretty steady at 50 - 100mg a day, every day), I want to enjoy life again. 

I guess my question is this:
does anyone else deal with this at such a young age? I am 21, but I don't feel mentally equipped to deal with this elephant in the room. I started to, and use, opiates to control my consuming depression, but I also suffer from OCD and that ""tells"" me to stay away from doctors and the hell that is SSRI dependence. Honestly, my mother was extremely religious during my early childhood, and she would not allow me to be diagnosed with ADHD, and this means that I have to risk jail time to acquire something that makes me feel normal for a few hours. 

Anyways, I am off to class and will read replies when I return. I love all of you, and I just want to feel love and emotion again (I've been in a void for a long time, but the void consumed me earlier this year when opiates became my outlet for happiness and enjoyment in life).

 post: This is mostly due to my reading that dude's oxy-hallucination post, but I wanted to ask this with regard to only fent. 

As someone who consumes around a 25 mcg/hr patch buccal (when I have fent), I have constant and enjoyable hallucinations. I have little to which I could compare these hallucinations, but they are a bit like when you combine amphetamines and sleep deprivation (and pot, lol). 

I find these to be mostly auditory, but with some ""edge-movement"" that I notice. The sounds, well, sound like a radio is playing, and there is the sensation that I am rocking back and forth - as if I am in movement with the universe. All of these hallucinations are fleeting and pose zero concern to me, as I enjoy them. 

Have you guys noticed this with fentanyl? Is this a serotonergic characteristic?",q3,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

 post: I took 15mg of oxy yesterday afternoon and it didn't even get me slightly well. 

After a year of daily use, I am done with these fucking useless pills and the useless fuckers who I have to deal with in my life. No, I'm not tapering, using subs, or any of that pussy shit -- no lope either  because I'm a man goddamnit.

As of Thursday, I was using 60mg of oxy to get right daily and 30mg to not be sick. Come at me, chills; come at me stomach problems. I'm so tired of constantly dealing with moderate to severe withdrawals. Even on a sunny day, I'm shivering, and my nose is draining. I love all of you and will still come here, and I'll chip monthly -- after a month clean. For now, I am coming back to reality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

EDIT: 48 hours since last oxy dose. I am starting to feel human again. Praise satan!!!

Holy shit, it's the morning of day 3 and I'm still clean. I havent been this far in...ever. The chills are less intense, the stomach issues are subsiding, and I actually slept like 6 hours last night (soma and drinking and smoking helped that one), so I actually don't feel bad. Is it normal to be very emotional during this time. Here I am, a person who is 21, and almost crying because of how amazing my life has become. Everything has been positive, and getting physically dependent on pills has been my number one roadblock.

 post: To everyone: taper and stop fucking using opiates/opioids. It gets better, I promise. Some legitimate medical reason, sure, keep using and more power to you. 

If you're thinking about starting to use opioids, stick to something like kratom. Hydrocodone is the entry-level to something that is more addictive than every other drug combined (for me). I've spent 95% of the money I've earned/borrowed in the past two years on these godforsaken pills, and I've only become depressed, as my fucking endorphan system doesn't work anymore, and this may take a while to heal.

Recently I drove a 2014 Honda accord. All I thought was ""damn, I'd love to have that car."" I estimate I've spent no less than $25,000 USD (but likely far more), and that car was only 21,000. Fuck my life. I love you all; stay safe.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Hey all. First time poster here, on and off lurker (when I'm not scooping dank memes elsewhere on the site).

Little history: First introduced to junk in HK at age 14. Spent my teen years in and out of rehab. Sometimes it stuck, sometimes it didn't. After moving from HK to the UK, and landing in Toronto at 18 I managed to clean up my life and stay clean for 8 years. 

At 26, having no prior experience with prescription opiates, I was prescribed Percocet (Vicodin in the US, I believe). Instantly brought back all the familiar feelings to my teen years—thus, beginning a roller coaster ride that lead up to a 160mg-minimum oxy habit for a couple of years. Destroyed credit, lost relationships, family lost their shit. Rediscovered junk eventually. Of course. 

Anyway, long story short, went to rehab at age 30, cleaned up for a year, life was awesome. Work great, all that. Relapse one year later, arrested at 32. Cleaned up again on bail (thank Yoda), beat the charges. 

Two years later, work is awesome, life is awesome, met my life-partner (she has no prior experience with opiates), life is good. Ended up finding a bottle of percs in her medicine cabinet while she was away over X-mas. Did them all in two days. Hated myself. Began the cycle all over again eventually. Percs to oxys, back to IV junk in no time. 

Another two years go by now of a roller coaster from hell. I use for three to six weeks, detox and WD for a few days, six at most. Partner-now-wife catches me out twice. Stays with me. I'm now on my last chance. Credit fucked again. I'm debt. Host of other problems. Didn't work for a year. Lost all my self respect and esteem and motivation again. Depressed as fuck, obviously. Oh, my wife is pregnant now—due in May, hopefully on the 4th. 

I'm on day 14 now. Every day is a little but better but also a little bit harder. I've had to call on my clean friends and therapist every single day for the past week. Hanging on for dear life here. It's Friday, I have money again. It's amazing how much money have when you don't blow 160 bucks a day into your arm. I have the devil in my ear saying just go grab a half G, you'll have a great day and you can say goodbye to it once and for all. I know it's bullshit and that's just gonna reopen that door into hell, but fuck me it's unreal how much I want to give into that lie. 

I feel like such a burden relying on my friends every day. So I'm finally posting here. 

I'm not sure what to expect by posting. But yeah.

Days 18, 19, and 20 were pretty good. Slept better those previous night. Last night was rough. No sleeping aids beyond melatonin. I have zopiclone but not super keen on that. 

Walking around a lot, doing chores, talking to my therapist, support network, being social, all that jazz. Doing the work. Hating it but doing it and feeling proud of myself at times for doing it. 

It's the middle of November and it's 15 degrees Celsius outside right now (60 degrees in American), it's gorgeous but I just feel like I want to grab all of a sudden.

 post: I'm wondering if any of you advocate for this? I have no stance on complete abstinence one way or another. Some need to, some don't. I don't drink at all. I do smoke weed. Don't have any at the moment and haven't really smoked much in the past few months as weed and H really put me out of commission to the rest of the world. 

Smoked a roach I had in my ash tray on Friday night and felt immense relief from the nasty cravings I was/am getting for my DOC. 

Right now I'm at home, winter has finally hit Ontario and I'm all like ""don't make the call, don't make the call"". 

What do you all think about smoking weed during this period? Do you find that it resets your brain recovery? Sets you up for a fall? Do you find the cravings for DOC worse over the next few days? Or do you find it as an actual quitting aid?

Looking for experience or logical reasoning here. Thanks!

Edit: I understand that there's a lot at play in recovery. I don't mean to solely deal with cravings with another drug. I know there's all the other work that goes along with it.

artooisgod,OpiatesRecovery,5m7uxx,1/5/2017 12:53,0,1,"title: Day 6 and feeling very frustrated and angry .
 post: I'm on day 6 here. Doing the moping at home thing. I've been on the phone all morning with therapist and support network and it's frustrating because rationally, there is absolutely no reason that I would trade a clean life to go grab ever again. Over the years, I've researched opiate addiction (as most of us have and continually do) and I've been in and out of rehab/therapy/meetings and all that, I understand and know how to beat this game, I just can't seem to shake it, though. 

What I'm trying to say is that I'm so frustrated with myself because my desire to use and be selfish is stronger than all rational thought and logic. It's also stronger than my commitment and love for the people in my life that love me. Stronger than my desire to live my life with pride, joy, accomplishment, success, happiness and freedom. Stronger than the idea of losing everything (yet again--this time, more than over lost--wife who loves me and upcoming baby in 5 months). This is disgusting and frustrating to me. 

Even now, on day 6 and just barely through the worst of the physical symptoms, my desire to use is still there. My desire to stay clean is also still there and this is why I'm posting about it and why I've been on the phone all morning. I have this dichotomy of desires that seem to swing back and forth like the wind. 

On one hand, I know that me going to grab and make that call is the worst idea in the world. On the other hand, it's the best idea for a temporary respite from my current misery and state. But of course, the real me knows it won't help but only make it worse. That does NOT make it any easier. 

I guess my overall point for anyone who may be in a similar place as me is that, I will always understand a fellow addict's struggle with their morality. The things I do due to this addiction would never happen in a normie life. I will never judge another addict for making the choice to use instead of the ""right thing""—because I've lived it—no, scratch that, I'm living it. Every time I go back out to use, I'm giving a big ""fuck you"" to my loved ones, wife and colleagues. My professional life (which I've worked very hard to build up in my clean years) is slowly being flushed down the tubes with every passing month. 

I'm sick of being a child. I'm fucking 37 this year and I think like a teenager. Fuck, even when I'm clean and I have thousands in the bank I don't pay my phone bill till they cut me off. This is how fucked up I am. I'm sick of it. I'm now convinced that my greatest enemy is my refusal to mature enough to become and act like a rational adult. 

I have destroyed my soul and life for far too long due to being like this. There's a million productive things I should be doing. Like looking for a new work contract or job since my last contract ended in December and of course, I blew my remaining 5K on dope. But instead, I'm feeling shitty, angry and frustrated at myself. So much that I feel paralyzed. 

I haven't even been able to string 30 days clean together in three years. Fuck. I hit 25 in December and I worked HARD for that. It FUCKING hurts to think about that work wasted and back here at day 7. 

If you can relate, I hope this post helps you not to be like me but better. For yourself. 

Edit/Addition: Just a little background for those who care or didn't read my posts from last month:

I first used at around 14 when I was growing up in HK. Cleaned up at 18. Fucked up around 26. Had a few years clean in between bouts of use. This current run has been going on almost three years now (after a couple years clean). In the past few years I've literally had too many day 5 and 6s to count. Literally. Not figuratively. I've gone through withdrawals in attempts to clean up so many times that I'm amazed my body hasn't shut down. Every time I go back, it's because I think and trick myself into believing that I won't use enough to get sick again and it's to just say ""goodbye"". It's always bullshit. 

I think that sometimes being intelligent is a curse, because you're smart (or stupid) enough to trick yourself into using again. I feel like if I was an idiot it would be easier sometimes. 

When presented with a choice: good or bad-- being stupid, you clearly pick the good choice without being able to rationalize the bad choice like I do. 

I'm just trying to say please don't be like me and throw away life of potential and awesomeness for a lifetime of misery spending half your day copping and the other half in a bathroom when the entire world passes you by. 

Edit: I'm on day 7. I lost a day in my detox somewhere and realized it was Thursday and not Friday for my last use. I only realized this because one my connects just texted me and the last message he sent was on Friday which I remember seeing right when the sickness was kicking in hard.

 post: Checked into rehab again on March 1st, I had been clean since February 22nd but was at a point where I knew if I didn't do something drastic that it would only be a matter of time before I picked up again, like so many other times. 

I've been to rehab before, last stint was in 2009. It was a very clinical style rehab, I learnt a lot about my addiction intellectually and it all made sense to me. I stayed clean for a year and a half and the roller coaster began again. Got arrested again in 2012, cleaned up again for a year a half—life was good but I was living a very unbalanced life and made no time for any recovery. I thought I had it licked again. Met my now-wife when clean. Fell in love with a wonderful woman. 

Then the cockiness, laziness, and complacency kicked in and eventually, I did the ""just once, I can handle it, it's just a perc and it's not IV dope, so it's fine"" thing. We all know where that led. 

Fast forward to last month. Pregnant wife. Chronic relapse after relapse. Desperate. Verge of ODing every day. Lost finances. Debt. Work suffering. Barely able to function. Wife at a loss. Desperate to see me help myself. Paralyzed. Crippled with self-pity, self-hatred, depression, misery and desperation. Truly hopeless. 

Knew that I'd been trying to kick for over a year to no avail. Too many ever-increasingly hellish and terrible detoxes. Too many days, weeks just white-knuckling in misery only to cave in. Too scared to kill myself but wanting to die. Too paralyzed to help myself but wanting to live. Just right fucked. I'm sure some can relate. 

Anyway. Rehab was exactly what I needed. Schedule, routine, feelings, emotion, shame processing, acceptance, self-care, self-love, proper eating, positivity with reality checks. Learning to deal with frustration from all the bullshit from other clients, counsellors, or whatever in a healthy manner again. Lots of good work was done in out small groups there. Dudes sharing their journals with us, their feelings— putting their balls on the table with the utmost in courage, bravery and honesty. 

My heart has begun to heal again. I dropped a lot of emotional weight in there. In one day there, I would laugh more than I have in the past 3 years. I also cried more than I ever have in there. They were tears of healing. Tears of sadness. Tears of hope. 

Also, I hit the gym and did voluntary exercise for the first time in 36 years of living. I hit the gym for 26 of the 28 days I was there and actually began to look forward and crave it after just the first day. 

I actually picked up the guitar in there and wrote songs for the first time in 4 years. Reconnected with that side of myself. Healing. Soothing. Enjoyable. Shareable. 

Reconnected with the side of myself I thought lost. The ability to relate to others, connect with them, be with them where they need me to be. Share my experiences with them and marvel in the shared healing power of that for both parties—myself and them. 

Got home yesterday afternoon and went running in the real world for the first time instead of a treadmill. Loved it. 

A lot more happened with me in there but I'm full of gratitude for a fresh lease on life. My wife has her partner back. My unborn daughter may now have a chance to grow up with a present father to help guide her through this world again. 

Woke up this morning in a completely different world to my morning yesterday. Life was simple in rehab. Wake up, make my bed. Gratitude list (super helpful for me), drink coffee, already laughing within 5-10 minutes of waking up, smoke, eat, class, small groups, blah blah, but always laughing or doing work, real work, soul work. Choice was there, but limited. 

The real world is full of a million choices. This morning, the fear started to creep in already. Rather than wallow in it and paralyze myself in the tried and true way of cyclical self punishment leading to disaster for myself, I took action. Grounded myself. Touched my wife. Listened to my still-beating heart, and instead of giving in to the urge to just stay in bed where it's safe, warm and devoid of choice, got up, made my side of the bed, took dog out, smoked—gratitude. Grateful that I didn't wake up sick and desperate. Grateful I still have my entire life ahead of me and I don't need to die alone with a needle in my arm. Grateful for hope again. Grateful to have choice. Grateful for feelings. Grateful to be able to share. 

I have a lot more I could share but I won't now. I hope this may be able to give someone hope or encouragement in a dark or hopeless time. 

I wanted to thank you all for giving me hope over the past few months. Some of you have read about my repeated attempts to get my shit together. It means the world to me. Thank you.

artooisgod,OpiatesRecovery,65cetl,4/14/2017 9:08,0,2,"title: 50 or so days clean—2.5 weeks out of rehab now .
 post: Hello to all truly brave and courageous people in here (yes, even you; just the fact that you are in here shows so much courage)!

Just wanted to post an update with where I'm at 50 or so days in (April 22nd will be two calendar months). I say 50 or so because I've found that this time around, I haven't really been counting the days. I have an approximation due to knowing my clean date, but yeah. I've found that o haven't been obsessing over it like I have in the most recent attempts.

I'm still formally off work currently but I have been building a new site for my business in the meantime and that's been occupying a lot of my time during the day while my wife is at work. The newfound motivation has been very empowering. Even more empowering is that I know the motivation stems from actual action, which inspires more motivation. Motivation for myself doesn't just magically appear from thin air in the same way heroin never just fell from the sky for me. It always, always required action. The action yields results, every single time. 

I'm not talking about major exertion and action and overextending myself like I do when I'm using, I'm talking about the small things—getting out of bed, choosing to go to bed at a reasonable hour even when I'm not tired. Choosing to exercise even though I don't feel like it. Choosing to be social even when I don't feel like it. Choosing to make my bed. Choosing... always trying to choose the 'next right thing' (as they say). I've found that it's done wonders for me mentally, physically and most of all, emotionally. It gets easier and easier to continue to make better choices for myself the more I do it. 

It might sound overwhelming for some of you who are down in the dumps and stuck in the perpetual doom cycle of action, inaction or bummed out thinking and feeling. I was there myself just 50 days ago. I also know that 50 days seems like a lifetime for many of you just fresh into or out of physical detox. I've been there myself too many times. This time around I literally could not see the light or any hope of surviving this. I even posted about it 2 days into my last detox and as always, there were people here to help me through that. 

My point is that no matter how many times I would hear that it would get easier, when I was stuck in it, I would always think that it might get easier for some, but it wouldn't for me. That's a lie. That's the drugs talking. That's the destroyed soul talking. That's the chemical war going on. I've always intellectually known it would get easier through my own experiences in the past and through others' but at the time it always feels so dark and so alone, so very alone. 

It DOES get easier. Not only easier but it gets GOOD. I'm laughing again. More than ever. I'm smiling again. It's still a conscious effort for me to be vigilant in my choices but it's less and less so every day. Even that I'm vigilant with as in the past in recovery, I've gotten cocky and started slacking. That always ended in a nosedive. 

My partner and I are having our first kid in the next couple of weeks. I'm really hoping it's on May the 4th. That would be the best fucking thing ever. I'm terrified but also kind of looking forward to the next chapter. I'm a little worried about money right this second but I know it's something that I can address in a short time. Slow and steady. 

Another thing I'm doing different this time around is instead of trying to WIN every day and win at recovery (I have a tendency to want to perfect everything), I'm aiming for balance. I don't think I've ever woken up and said to myself ""I'm gonna have the most BALANCED fucking day EVER!"" before. This time, that's my goal. I recognize that perfection goes hand in hand with procrastination. Procrastination in my recovery is bad. Bad, bad, bad (to quote the leader of the free world). Feeling balanced and living balanced for me is a very satisfying thing. 

Another thing I'm aiming for is to be teachable. I don't always have to be the smartest fucking person in the room. I have a tendency to intellectualize everything and have a very broad understanding about the clinical side of things and that's never really done me any favours. I'm the past, as soon as someone starts talking about a subject I feel that I'm knowledgable on or feel that I know more than they do, I've shut off and taken a seat on my high horse—thus remaining unteachable. This time around, I'm shutting the fuck up and just soaking in what I can. I'm even going to fucking meetings. Something I always thought I wouldn't need or want. ""It works for other people but not for me"" again. That's just arrogance and denial at work in me. 

The trick for me is being open this time around. Just having an open mind. None of this shit can hurt me at all so why not just fucking try it with an open heart? I certainly do know that in the past, doing things the way I wanted to resulted in a negative outcome that did indeed hurt me. So WHY THE FUCK NOT TRY SOMETHING NEW?! If I knew everything then I wouldn't have relapsed a billion times. 

I haven't fully embraced the 12 step thing yet and I haven't started chugging the koolaid but I am taking small sips and finding it easier and easier to keep down. Not only keep down, but I'm starting to like the taste now. Something I never thought would happen in all my 36 years. I first used at age 14. I've had pricey therapists, rehabs, and all of that. I've studied it. I've lived it. And now what I'm finding the most helpful is the free thing. 

For me, it's about the fellowship right now. I've always had a good support network but something about stepping into a room and not having to explain myself or educate someone about why I'm like the way I am is POWERFUL. Fuck me it's a relief. I can just ""be"". 

So to recap. This time around I'm open to new things. Aiming for balance. Living life one choice at a time. Taking it slow but consistently. Journaling, exercising, playing music, hanging with friends, having sex with my partner, doing conscious things for my recovery as opposed to just living a sober life and all that. 

I'm nowhere near out of the woods, but for now, I'm not constantly obsessing about getting high. The reminders of where I was just a short time ago is enough for me to stop those thoughts real quickly. Living in a fucking bathroom is no life at all. Dying in said bathroom were a real possibility too with all the fentanyl that's out there. Street heroin in Toronto is all fent right now. No pretences anymore. I'm not experiencing any major cravings either. This is due to me constantly making conscious positive actions and choices I believe. No one likes being an addict. Everyone likes the high. But for me, the brief 15-second rush when the shit enters my bloodstream followed by 15 minutes of feeling good never balanced out the hell I was living. 

There is hope. There is light in the darkest times. Find it. Live it. I have to remind myself that if all I have is myself, then that's enough. More than fucking enough. I am worth it. I'm not the person I feel I am when I am actively using. I am kind. I am loving. I am thoughtful. I am a positive force in my own life and others' through my experience. There is always hope. In the darkest times, just know that you are never alone, there's always someone, many of us who know that darkness and will always accept you for who you know you are inside. Not the addict. The real you. Love, light, hope and all that hippie feeling shit to you all. 

And having a really fucking balanced Easter fucking weekend!!!

Love and hugs from Toronto

 post: I'm about to be a first-time parent. If baby Boba Leia (jk) doesn't decide to pop out of my partner's cooch by Monday, she will be induced. 

So by this time Tuesday, I'll officially be a dad. 

I'm fucking terrified beyond belief. I think that's normal for normies, but as an addict in early recovery (Feb. 22), I'm tripping balls. 

I've been thankful to have some extra time before the event to continue to work on my shit but I'm also terrified that the life upheaval will be more than I WANT to handle. 

I'm struggling with many fears and doubts right now. 

I'm still on the whole self-absorbed ""me me me"" mentality right now. As in, focusing on what I need to do for my ""recovery"" and to get to a good place emotionally, spiritually and mentally. 

I don't feel ready. 

It's weird. I have the perfect partner. We're a great team. She's the most supportive and understanding person I've ever met. She's kind, patient, assertive and we have very open communication. Yet, I find myself and my thoughts wandering to how much I yearn for ""freedom"". 

I guess it might be my addict brain just looking for ways to take the ""easy"" road away from responsibilities and mature things. I find myself wishing for days of being single, free, carefree and without an impending child that we will be responsible for, for the rest of her life and ours. 

I am finding myself looking back to my days before I was in a long-term monogamous relationship and without any responsibilities other than my own self-care. I know this is selfish and foolish but it is me sharing openly and honestly. 

I'm working on a California Fourth Step thing right now that asks some really hard questions. Even though I know that no one has to ever read the answers, I'm finding myself struggling to be be completely and brutally honest with some of the answers. I guess that's the whole denial and refusal to be honest—even with myself—thing that is often spoken about. 

I'm kind of stressing too much about my own future right now, I guess. 

Not sure what I'm hoping for by posting this but I just wanted to get it down in writing I guess and share some of my fears and doubts. 

Maybe some of you have some feedback, advice or can relate?

 post: Hello, I love browsing this sub even though I have been clean off heroin for 7 years and some change. look I'm not trying to convince people in here to stop getting high, or preach, and stick my nose up like some fucking god just wanted to share some shit w you all. I started using heroin back in 2004, after graduation I got into pills, you know the story well eventually I tried heroin and I loved it. Back then you could get a gram for around 20 bucks or so in downtown, now listen this was terrible dope my tolerance before quitting was around a ball a day I never tried the stuff these kids are getting there hands on these days and I'm lucky. I would have probably ended up dead! It wasn't unusual to shoot a gram right after coppin.

I ended up in inpatient treatment 4 times, tried moving across state, went to state ran detox facilities 7 times, was In a 51/50 mental lock up once, I ran the gambent. After trying NA and all that and never making 60 days of being clean, I was in the suboxin program multiple times. I had finally made it, I thought, had a job, a car, was selling OxyContin in 09 and taking subs, had money,women, dope was never sick and after spending 5 hours trying to find a vein one day I just had enough and stopped. I shot the remaining half gram of dope that was mixed in my rig full of blood and frustration into a shoe box full of needles and decided to quit! I had 11 8mg subs, and 3100 dollars under my mattress, and a job still,but had enough of dull needles and endless nights alone. 

I had completely shut myself off from the world at that point no friends,no girl, hell I didn't even serve my customers I was in complete isolation. I was a junkie of the worse kind people, I loved dope I was the friend who everyone always thought took it to far. I had enough, had enough of the nasty feeling the lonely nights and dull needles. 

I was coming off almost a year habit of a ball a day and took those subs 4 of them the first night and 2 for a few days tell they were gone and the next thing I did was attended na meetings every fucking day.

Now do I still attend NA meetings? fuck no, I don't haven't for about 5 years...but let me feed you with a theory:  I needed it then, Na was the most familiar setting to the dope game without the dope that I could find. The crazy people the slutty women (sorry ladies) the drama,  I needed that to keep my mind going for a while. Got in a few relationships the women were crazy even survived a girl I felt I loved who lied,cheated, and stole from me and was high and on drugs in front of me numerous times but I refused to let her fuck my life up again. When she was gone I was heartbroken, found out she cheated on me, I wrecked my car and was fired from my job the same day still refused the life of heroin.

After my 4th day being dope sick I bumped into this homeless women I used to always break off when she was sick,she asked how I was doing I told her I was 4 days sober she asked if I wanted some I told her no, after that day I knew I was done but was tested many times. 

I still remember the obsession of not wanting to be a junkie anymore,but couldn't stop! Numerous times I went to detox, got out went to my parents and felt overwhelmed and that fucking depression sunk in that feeling that I was never going to enjoy life again and within a few hours a friend would be meeting me with a shot up the street, and it always was never that great and I always of coarse would tell myself you just had to get that out of the way, don't let yourself get a habit, and within a week I was stealing receipts out of the garbage at Home Depot and trying to get cash back from some customer service agent who I knew was about to call the cops.

I was once kicked out of a treatment center when I was 19 in Seattle for smoking crack in the treatment center. I was a die hard peeps! Anyways plenty of more stories I could share countless jail visits, dead friends, guns to my head etc....and today after 7 years I have a job that pays around 80k a year,own a home,have a nice car, and it's all almost a forgotten dream.

I remember it all sometimes, and as I sit up at night (can't sleep) I read the posts on here and think of you all! And want every single one of you to know if you want to stop you will I promise you that and if you don't,  do your thing I will never judge you. This is freedom, in this forum you are all real people and I love you all! If your in the PNW, and would like some stories or maybe some help you can PM me...look this isn't a plea to NA or nothing like this. Hell even if you don't want to quit hit me up I'll do what I can.
I'll listen won't judge, I just want to make a difference! I won't give you money to get dope sorry! You should be good enough at that (I was rarely sick when using and no I didn't have rich mommy and daddy) but seriously someone to talk to, Maybe a ride to a job interview?  I'm here I don't attend NA but I still want to help, Whatever I can do let me know, need a meal? Some cigarettes? Naloxone? I'll help all I can...god bless you guys and stay safe few people I knew just recently fell out this shit these days is strong fuck ✌️️",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

What I have a problem with, is having a ""safe injection site"" where people feel like the practice of shooting heroin is not taboo. The mere thought of this is terrible. What junky ever has copped and decided to walk, ride, drive to find a safe injection site to fix? People fix in the nearest alley bathroom they can find period.

Read it, don't read it, whatever, I love this sub and all of you so if you're bored...here you go. Sorry it's so long. 


********************


Robert is sitting flat eyed at the dining room table taking bites out of a cheeseburger with a grease-stained paper bag set in front of him.  This sight makes me recoil back into the bedroom and almost shut the door. I can't comprehend why he is back here. A white plasticky hospital bracelet dangles from his wrist as he ignores all but his meal in front of him. Things would get much worse, incredibly so, but I didn't know it yet.  It's just past 1 am. The events of the evening made time slip by so quickly. I don't work tomorrow, fuck it, I think, and proceed to sink down into a sitting position on the edge of the mattress with the door ajar so I can see Robert in the dining room. Dylan and Art are talking on the porch, I strain to hear what they're saying and press my face against the screen in the window to listen.


Hours earlier, when the sun had just barely set so it was dark out but not too cold yet, we stood in the kitchen. Happy John brought a pizza home for everyone to share. It was a weird pizza, covered in pieces of bacon and sausage. The crust was too chewy, too thin and lukewarm. But it was free. Dylan looked up with a mouthful of pizza and chewed on his words.


""Where's Robert? "" he asked noncommitaly. As house manager,  he was responsible for doling out Roberts meds. Once in the morning, once at night. Lately he has been having me hand Robert his medication, with a glass of water and a kindly forced smile.


""Here's your meds, dude"" I say smiling but I don't look into his eyes. Robert hates women. He likes pussy, and has an unhealthy and flagrant passion for porn, but as people he distrusts and loathes females. Maybe it's because of his mother. His mom,  who dropped Robert off in Arts driveway and sped away leaving tire marks in the gravel. She couldn't handle him anymore. 32 years of dealing with Robert I couldn't imagine, but...Still. What a bitch. She will pay his bills to displace her guilt,  I guess. Dylan thinks this will be good for us, that he will trust me more, if I deliver the medicine. He trusts Dylan and also mistakenly believes that Dylan owns this house we live in, and that he is in charge. The only person in charge above him is Art. Robert loves Art. He would absolutely kill for him and I know it.


But tonight during med time Robert is not present. He's not on the porch smoking hand rolled cigarettes and he's not in the bathroom. I rise from the couch in the sitting room and walk over to the fridge. Opening it to retrieve a soda, the shelves are bare.


""What the fuck?"" I recoil and back my head out of the fridge to stare at everyone eating pizza oblivious. 


""Why is the fridge empty?"" I inquire. 


This house has 15 people living in it. The shelves are never empty, thanks to every last one of us being on food stamps. Food is frequently pilfered and exchanged but is never completely *gone*. 


I open the second fridge on the other side of the counter. Less dire here, but still more barren than usual and certainly not containing the missing food from fridge #1. I throw the door of the Community food cupboard open with a gasp. All of the canned food is gone. What the fuck?


The side screen door to the kitchen opens and Grizzly John walks in. He is large, muscular and fit, with a huge beard and sideburns. But Grizzly John has a goofy smile and drawl in his voice. He's a kind guy. 


""Robert threw all of the food out."" He states in an amused tone. 


""What?!"" I shriek, ""Where? Why didn't you stop him?""


Grizzly John still has a bemused smile on. Robert told him he was cleaning the fridge. He left it alone. Now there are two huge Rubbermaid trash bins outside filled with our food. That part he missed. 


""I didn't think he was throwing it away,"" states Grizzly John. He's not the smartest man ever but Robert always does odd things. He can't be blamed. 


The first time I met Robert, no one warned me that he was a severe schizophrenic, or in laymans terms batshit crazy. I walked into the house and into the sitting room to find Dylan. Instead I find Robert, staring intently at whatever is on the big screen television. The TV is off.


""Hi,"" I say as I walk through his line of sight. I am used to people I don't know here, constantly. In a clean and sober house such as ours there is always someone new, someone old and returning for a visit, friends of roommates, family of roommates...Robert doesn't respond but I find everyone else in the den next to the kitchen. A few minutes later I walk into the bathroom and lean to pull the door shut, and in shock see Robert standing close behind me in the way of the door. He looks at me like a junkie in withdrawal looks at a bag of dope. I lean the opposite direction with a frown.


""Do you wanna have sex now?"" Robert inquires simply, not really looking at me, or anything, anymore.
 

""What the fuck?"" I inquire back. I shut the door and lock it, still confused. It must be this guy's idea of a joke, except we haven't met yet and that seems rude. When I emerge from the bathroom to my relief he's not outside the door. I tell Dylan I'm going to smoke and then take a nap, over my shoulder as I open the screen door to the porch. Suddenly I feel arms grasp me from behind and a hot breath on my neck. 


""Can I come take a nap too?"" Asks the voice strangely. But it's not Dylans voice and the arms grab me too roughly. I spin around in anger and shove Robert off of me. Once the situation was explained to me it took everything Dylan had to not beat Roberts ass. I'm glad at least the physical altercation was avoided, because as we would later learn, Robert had superhuman strength once he went into violence mode. 


Dylan stands from the couch and coffee table, chewing his last bite of pizza. Roberts voice comes from the front porch. Ah. He's back. Hopefully he wasn't in the neighbors yard again, on their porch. They don't like that too much. He's calling Dylan outside, says he wants to show him something. 


I'm in conversation with the others, eating and sitting and winding down our day for several minutes. Suddenly the screen door slams open and BANG hits the wall in the neighboring room. Bellows come from the porch and we all stand, searching each other's faces for an explanation. Happy John and I briskly switch rooms and find Dylan doubled over, pawing at his face and Robert is nowhere. 


Robert has spells. Episodes, you could call them. Where he freaks out a little, does odd things or offends someone who doesn't (or sometimes even does) know him. Like the time he stripped naked and we found him on the side of the house spray painting himself with a can of spray paint stolen from the garage. He had already sprayed his old black Nike sneakers and now was concentrating on himself. 


""Dylan, look! I have blue balls!"" Cackled Robert while Dylan looked on in horror. He continued laughing and spraying his nude body a brilliant shade of azure, oblivious to the crowd that gathered on the front lawn. The neighbors called the police, of course, but by the time they got there Dylan had him calmed down and clothed, indoors again. The cops just laughed at the recounting of the tale. They laughed, and said he wasn't hurting anyone, so they couldn't do anything like arrest him or take him somewhere. It was apparent to me long before this that Robert needed specialized help, and that was something we could not provide, but the resources in our state are limited and most places would only hold him for 48 hours then turn him back out onto the streets. Art had a soft spot for Robert and so he stayed. I never knew exactly why, but I do know that Robert smoked far too much crack and did far too much ex and his mind never recovered. I think Art saw that it could have been him in Roberts place had he not gotten clean. 


So I rush to Dylans side, my hand on his bent-over back. 


""What happened??"" I ask. 


""He threw a bunch of dirt and rocks in my face,"" Dylan replied, standing up straight watery-eyed and rubbing at his eyes with his knuckles. 


Robert was not usually violent. His *happenings* were happening more frequently now, and in shorter intervals. Sometimes his meds would quit working and the doctors would change the dose, change the prescription. It just kept him stable most of the time. All of this in one day was an ominous cry for attention, or help. Things in Roberts world weren't the same as ours. Usually his spells were limited to him rambling that someone in the house wanted to cut off his dick, or rape him, or other such graphic nonsense. These ramblings were constricted, however, to the living room couch that Robert slept on and only heard by ears passing through on their way in or out of the front door. The things that Robert said he truly believed. He thought his thoughts were real. Perceived danger was always lurking for him, another abandonment or betrayal. Most of the time, given you knew he was crazy, Robert seemed to be able to hold normal conversations and blended into the background, sitting on the couch staring at the TV or conked out after his med dose. We were just used to Robert being Robert. He carried a plastic toy bucket, like one would play with at the beach, filled with tobacco for rolling cigarettes. On top of the mound of tobacco were two tiny plastic monster trucks. They were always in the bucket, as if the brown tobacco was a pile of dirt they drove back and forth on. Occasionally an action figure would be added in the mix and Robert would excitedly show you his new prize from the dollar store. Taking Robert anywhere was a rare occurrence because he would act up in public, and do or say insanely inappropriate things. Art was really the only one who could keep him fully in control. 


Dylan righted himself and stood up straight. 


""I gotta go find him."" He stated. It was dark out and Robert out in the neighborhood in a fit after dark was bad. Happy John and Dylan leave to search for him while Grizzly John and I retire back to the den. Before too long, Grizzly John goes outside and I do dishes at the sink. 


""HEY,"" Grizzly yells into the screen door next to me several minutes later, startling me enough that I almost drop the soapy plate I am handling. 


""Come outside, now!"" Grizzly shouts. Alarmed I step onto the side porch. Grizzly is running up the driveway. 


""Robert is at IGA freaking out and breaking shit!"" He says wide eyed, over his shoulder as he runs. I grab my purse and keys, and climb into the drivers seat of my shiny black hatchback. Grizzly John backtracks several steps and throws himself into the passenger seat. IGA food mart is literally 3 or 4 houses up and around the corner, but I want to drive. We pull into the parking lot and I immediately see Art's Nissan parked there. I sigh in relief. Art will handle Robert.


We emerge from the vehicle to a scene. Shattered glass lays sparkling on the sidewalk reflecting the orangey street lights that illuminate the parking lot. Fireman from the fire station directly next to our house mill around the IGA entrance with employees from the store and would-be customers. I peer in and see Art standing, arms spread open non-threateningly, at the end of an aisle inside the store. The fireman holds a forearm out to stop me. 


""You can't shop right now, ma'am."" He states firmly. I shake my head at him and Grizzly John follows close behind me. We're his roommates, I state. The firemen stand back, looking almost amused. 


""Why aren't you guys in there?"" I snap, leveling my gaze at the two standing arms-crossed outside the door. 


""We have to wait for the police if it's a violent individual,"" replies the other. I shake him off again. 


""Robert's not vio-""


CRASH


SMASH


The tinkling sound of glass breaking like little sharp bells jerks my attention back inside the store. A sour smell creeps into my nostrils. Robert was smashing bottles of wine, while Art waved his arms wildly. 


""ROBERT! Stop, buddy! Come here!"" Pleads Art. Dylan stands at the opposite end of the aisle, trapping Robert like a pacing lion between the two. 


""THEY'RE TRYING TO FUCKING KILL ME!"" Screams Robert. 


""THEY WANNA CUT MY FUCKING DICK OFF AND THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME!""


A short Mexican lady looks on annoyed, huffs and then waddles back to her pearl white Escalade. She gets in but doesn't leave. Other customers are much more invested in this saga unfolding before them, and continue to stand with us, the firemen, and two employees of IGA in dark green aprons.


""Robert, buddy, no one wants to kill you, we love you, man!"" Says Art exasperated. He slowly walks in Roberts direction, like circling a wild animal, hands still up and palms open. 


""Where are the fucking police?"" I ask no one in particular. By this time Grizzly John has entered the store as back up. 


Art approaches Robert slowly, talking to him in a low voice. Then it happens. Art gets within arms reach of Robert, and reaches out and grasps both sides of Roberts face. He pulls him to him and they touch foreheads. I can't hear what Art is saying. He continues to speak lowly, his forehead up against Roberts. Tears spring up behind my eyes. An intense bond passes between them and its almost visible as Robert gives up and quiets his yelling, sagging into Art's body as he pulls him. Dylan trails behind them as Art walks Robert out of the store, arm slung over his shoulders. 


""It's alright, man, we love you."" Art repeats as they move over broken glass and exit the store. The customers and employees scatter from the entrance like a shark passes through a school of fish. Art locks eyes with me and I shoo everyone away from the trio that exits now. Robert has his back to the concrete wall outside and slides down sitting next to Art. 


The police finally show up. I am not a fan of cops by any means but these ones are human. They try to understand that Robert is just classically crazy. The IGA employees are apparently human too; they don't want to press charges just want the broken windows and merchandise paid for...and it's probably best that Robert not return to shop here. I roll my eyes. That's a given. Dylan, Grizzly John and I drive back to the house per Art's request and leave them there. I see the two in my rear view mirror, still sitting against the concrete, Art's arm still slung protectively over Roberts shoulders. 


The cops take Robert up the street to St. Francis, the local hospital. Grizzly John is outside in the driveway, salvaging what canned food he can rinse and return to our now-humble cupboards. It's almost cute, big Grizzly John digging through black trash bags for canned corn and pineapple juice, placing the saveable ones in a pile on the lawn.  Hours later Art and Robert return to the house, Robert clutching a bag of fast food, still wearing his plastic hospital identification band. I am slightly shocked but not quite incredulous at the fact that they released him so soon. Although he threw rocks through the store windows and broke bottles, he didn't actually hurt anyone as far as they knew. Dylan didn't mention the gravel that was thrown in his face. 


Dylan and Art return from the porch. Now Robert looks up. 


""Dylan?"" Asks Robert. 


""Yes, Robert."" Sighs Dylan in response. 


""You're not gonna kick me out, are you? I'm sorry."" Says Robert. And he is human again. A half smile spreads across Dylan's tired face.


""No, buddy. No one is kicking you out.""",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0

 post: So since I know you guys enjoy writing now and then, I thought maybe I'd share one of my stories. This is a time when I got cleaned up off heroin and lived in a clean and sober house. So much crazy shit happened there I could probably write a book lol so here's just one story about Robert. There are many more stories about Robert but this is one. Read it, don't read it, whatever, I love this sub and all of you so if you're bored...here you go. Sorry it's so long. Feedback appreciated! (Also posted in r/opiates)


********************


Robert is sitting flat eyed at the dining room table taking bites out of a cheeseburger with a grease-stained paper bag set in front of him.  This sight makes me recoil back into the bedroom and almost shut the door. I can't comprehend why he is back here. A white plasticky hospital bracelet dangles from his wrist as he ignores all but his meal in front of him. Things would get much worse, incredibly so, but I didn't know it yet.  It's just past 1 am. The events of the evening made time slip by so quickly. I don't work tomorrow, fuck it, I think, and proceed to sink down into a sitting position on the edge of the mattress with the door ajar so I can see Robert in the dining room. Dylan and Art are talking on the porch, I strain to hear what they're saying and press my face against the screen in the window to listen.


Hours earlier, when the sun had just barely set so it was dark out but not too cold yet, we stood in the kitchen. Happy John brought a pizza home for everyone to share. It was a weird pizza, covered in pieces of bacon and sausage. The crust was too chewy, too thin and lukewarm. But it was free. Dylan looked up with a mouthful of pizza and chewed on his words.


""Where's Robert? "" he asked noncommitaly. As house manager,  he was responsible for doling out Roberts meds. Once in the morning, once at night. Lately he has been having me hand Robert his medication, with a glass of water and a kindly forced smile.


""Here's your meds, dude"" I say smiling but I don't look into his eyes. Robert hates women. He likes pussy, and has an unhealthy and flagrant passion for porn, but as people he distrusts and loathes females. Maybe it's because of his mother. His mom,  who dropped Robert off in Arts driveway and sped away leaving tire marks in the gravel. She couldn't handle him anymore. 32 years of dealing with Robert I couldn't imagine, but...Still. What a bitch. She will pay his bills to displace her guilt,  I guess. Dylan thinks this will be good for us, that he will trust me more, if I deliver the medicine. He trusts Dylan and also mistakenly believes that Dylan owns this house we live in, and that he is in charge. The only person in charge above him is Art. Robert loves Art. He would absolutely kill for him and I know it.


But tonight during med time Robert is not present. He's not on the porch smoking hand rolled cigarettes and he's not in the bathroom. I rise from the couch in the sitting room and walk over to the fridge. Opening it to retrieve a soda, the shelves are bare.


""What the fuck?"" I recoil and back my head out of the fridge to stare at everyone eating pizza oblivious. 


""Why is the fridge empty?"" I inquire. 


This house has 15 people living in it. The shelves are never empty, thanks to every last one of us being on food stamps. Food is frequently pilfered and exchanged but is never completely *gone*. 


I open the second fridge on the other side of the counter. Less dire here, but still more barren than usual and certainly not containing the missing food from fridge #1. I throw the door of the Community food cupboard open with a gasp. All of the canned food is gone. What the fuck?


The side screen door to the kitchen opens and Grizzly John walks in. He is large, muscular and fit, with a huge beard and sideburns. But Grizzly John has a goofy smile and drawl in his voice. He's a kind guy. 


""Robert threw all of the food out."" He states in an amused tone. 


""What?!"" I shriek, ""Where? Why didn't you stop him?""


Grizzly John still has a bemused smile on. Robert told him he was cleaning the fridge. He left it alone. Now there are two huge Rubbermaid trash bins outside filled with our food. That part he missed. 


""I didn't think he was throwing it away,"" states Grizzly John. He's not the smartest man ever but Robert always does odd things. He can't be blamed. 


The first time I met Robert, no one warned me that he was a severe schizophrenic, or in laymans terms batshit crazy. I walked into the house and into the sitting room to find Dylan. Instead I find Robert, staring intently at whatever is on the big screen television. The TV is off.


""Hi,"" I say as I walk through his line of sight. I am used to people I don't know here, constantly. In a clean and sober house such as ours there is always someone new, someone old and returning for a visit, friends of roommates, family of roommates...Robert doesn't respond but I find everyone else in the den next to the kitchen. A few minutes later I walk into the bathroom and lean to pull the door shut, and in shock see Robert standing close behind me in the way of the door. He looks at me like a junkie in withdrawal looks at a bag of dope. I lean the opposite direction with a frown.


""Do you wanna have sex now?"" Robert inquires simply, not really looking at me, or anything, anymore.
 

""What the fuck?"" I inquire back. I shut the door and lock it, still confused. It must be this guy's idea of a joke, except we haven't met yet and that seems rude. When I emerge from the bathroom to my relief he's not outside the door. I tell Dylan I'm going to smoke and then take a nap, over my shoulder as I open the screen door to the porch. Suddenly I feel arms grasp me from behind and a hot breath on my neck.

bottom_bitch_pikachu,opiates,5m1kxs,1/4/2017 15:31,0,1,"title: Withdrawal....Again .
 post: Hi friends. I used to be quite active on this sub but got clean for close to a year. Well I relapsed and it turned into a three month bender. I didn't even go back to IV use this time around, only smoking tar. However my tolly shot straight back up to spending $100+ a day. I was previously an active user for 8 years with 6 months clean once or twice until this last 90 day slip. So now I'm miserable, out of options, and have to kick. I swear the withdrawals are just as bad if not worse than last time I detoxed even though I was doing significantly less, diff ROA and shorter time period. I'm almost 24 hours in and miserable. I took lope which didn't work, dosed 2 mg bupe about an hour ago and 2 more mg about ten minutes ago. Hoping for some relief soon. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through another 4-5 days of this! I just wanna be free again. I really hate the junkie life. Early sobriety is easy enough for me after the first 7 days. It's that first week I have the most trouble with. I know it's half mental...wish I could convince myself I wasn't sick. Instead my brain is scheming to get dope. Fuck I gotta make it through!

 post: Headed into day 5 of cold turkey with evening coming into sight....this morning was the worst so far. Haven't slept still at all, just absolutely miserable and losing my mind. Since I'm staying with my mom while detoxing, before she went to work she sat down with me and said, ""you're not going to use, I know you won't. You've come too far. What can we do to get you through the next couple of days?""


Now I've been skeptical of kratom because my tolerance/length of use is so high and other 'miracles' such as lope did nothing for me. Even suboxone doesn't sit well. So my mom and I looked at our options, got some info, and we decided to try kratom. She drove me straight to the nearest headshop and paid way too much for 75 capsules. I took 2 g initially and another 2 g in the next hour, then got into a boiling hot bath. 2 hours have passed and my hellish withdrawals went from %99 to about %30 now. But God what a huge difference! I'm still very sore and emotional but compared to the brutal blunt misery of acute withdrawal this is RELIEF. I'm so happy I could cry. I'm almost to the other side of this and can't wait for freedom! Onto day 5!

At this point I'm so far in, have shed so much sweat and tears, and am totally consumed by guilt for what my mom has been doing for me. The lady is a fucking saint. Working 2 jobs and taking care of my dog and I while I detox. She's made sure I have weed, cigarettes, whatever I need to be comfortable. My mom and I have a rocky past but I'm her only child and today when I was at a breaking point she looked me in the eyes and told me I was sick, I was an addict and that she would do everything to help me she could as long as I wanted it bad enough. I'm resolved to get back on my feet and make her happy. I had a year clean last year before this relapse and man I can't wait to get back to sobriety. 


So yeah, kratom! Wow again. I'm blown away it helped this much and it only took 4-5 gs (which I plan on tapering future doses to nothing over the next few days) but I'm sure being into day 4 of withdrawal had an effect on it too. I was especially skeptical of buying from a smoke shop but thought it certainly wouldnt hurt anything to try! So glad i did! Sorry for rambling! Stay up friends.



Edit: just in case anyone was wondering, I bought ""Krave botanicals"" Bali kratom and it was $44 for 75 .5 g capsules. So far it's been worth it as long as I don't think of the dope I could have bought with it...but since my goal is to be clean it's a worthwhile investment.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"0,5",0,0,0,0

 post: It gets better! I posted here a few days ago absolutely losing my shit. I was basically sitting on my hands watching the clock minute by minute telling myself not to leave the house. I knew if I left I'd get dope. I was just so miserable, so depressed, complete anhedonia, couldn't even watch a fucking TV show. Nothing could hold my attention and I felt crushing sadness and hopelessness. This combined with the physical symptoms were too much to bear. I've detoxed countless times and every time they get worse and more prolonged. I truly didn't think I would make it cold turkey. This freezing weather is the definition of cold turkey lol. Absolutely miserable. The morning of day 7 I went to the hospital and got some non narcotic meds  (clonidine, vistaril, gabapentin) to help me through. I tried kratom but it only paused the withdrawal. Today is day 10, I slept 6 hours STRAIGHT last night, and woke up without the deep bone chills. I was so happy I cried. Yesterday I went to 2 meetings and got myself a sponsor. I'm meeting her today one on one and I'm so grateful I feel better than yesterday. 


I know that time is dragging so slowly while you're sick. A minute is a lifetime. This is one of the most difficult things you will ever do, physically and mentally, in your life. But you CAN do it. You're SO much stronger than you think. The human body is an amazing thing. You can do this. Thousands of people before and after you have and will do this too. But once it's done, you don't ever have to do it again. You're so close to freedom and happiness. It gets better I promise promise promise. My wds were so drawn out and awful this time around. I was still in full blown wd on day 7. Two days later though it was like night and day. Don't give up. You've gotta do this sooner or later and later will only prolong the pain. I relapsed off a year clean this time. I'm ready to try again and beat this. If you're losing it, TALK TO SOMEONE! That's the only thing that helped when I was in the worst part of the storm. Post here, people will help you. They helped me. Message me to talk if you need to. I know you can do this, and you know it too! ♡",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"1,0",0,0,0,0

This I cannot really get behind tho. This is not only a sexual thing as even little boys are quite fascinated with their willy. There is this childish pride that makes guys send dickpics for example. Never, ever would the average woman send you a vajaypic as we have quite a different relationship with our genitals I reckon. And this is not only a social thing where men can live their sexuality more openly, it seems to me that this is kinda hard wired or something. Not that I know. Any enlightenment is welcome.

 post: TLDR: After addiction, friend and I have noticed we have extremely negative reactions to food. Anyone else have any knowledge or experience with this? **ANY** help is extremely appreciated.

Non-TLDR: My close friend and I both went through a long history together abusing opiates. He was more of the pills and I was more of the H. However, on our journey in recovery (were both about 1.5 years sober), we've noticed that we both have extremely bad reactions to specific foods. 

When we don't eat healthily our entire bodies pretty much shut down and we both become very tired, irritable, and lack motivation. The only way to avoid this is if we stick to very strict diets like gluten free foods, vegetables, and take certain supplements. When we do eat right, we have great days. As addicts in recovery, having ""great"" days is extremely important for us.

I'm normally very skeptical about these types of diets but after such a long period of feeling like shit I decided to give in to my friend's theory and there are definitely noticeable effects. Sure, maybe some of it is a placebo effect, but I cant deny that I feel better until I eat a delicious bagel or chinese food, and then I go into my post-addiction lifestyle of just laying in bed.

It would mean a great deal to both of us if anyone had any information related to this, or if anyone has any experience on the subject. Thank you for reading.

Edit: I want to add that alcohol does both of us a world of hurt. Towards the beginning of my recovery, I was drinking often just to mentally cope with the opiate withdrawals (bad idea, i know) and it pretty much made my withdrawals worse in every aspect, and from what I've heard from most people is that alcohol temporarily helps the w/d.

Several months later, after the main w/d's were over, I had a glass of Maker's Mark, and threw up immediately. This happened on two separate occasions also. Same alcohol, different days. Based on my friend's theory, he assumed that since Maker's is a drink made from wheat (an assumption I personally don't actually know), is the reason why I was having such a bad reaction to it. I also had the worst RLS I've ever had after I drank the Makers, even compared to the lowest point of my w/d's. I do not drink anymore, and this was a *very* easy decision to make and encourage other people in recovery to make the same decision.

Another side note: I am still on suboxone, my friend is not. Leading both of us to believe our long periods of addiction have damaged a part of ourselves that processes food, possibly. Why has food suddenly become a major issue in my life? Prior to my addiction, I was a normal high school kid who ate whatever/whenever and was totally fine.

Some other information that may help:

- Neither of us are overweight. If anything I am slightly underweight, and he is simply average.

- The only allergy either of us had to food prior to addiction was myself with milk. If I have to much, I will have skull-splitting migraines that often require trips to the hospital.

- We're both very different in age, yet we have such similar reactions to food. I'm 24 while he is in his early 40's.

- Other than my friend having minor-arthritis, there are no serious medical conditions we have. I do have occasional sleep issues similar to parasomnia, but I do not think these issues are related.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"1,0",0,0,0,0

 post: First and foremost, I apologize for the massive wall of text and poor formatting. I'm on mobile, but will do the best I can.

So here I am, 60 days clean today. I am very active and busy in my recovery. I work steps with a sponsor and attend meetings regularly. Its these things I need to remind myself to be grateful for today, as I'm working through a lot of issues.

I'll try to keep it as short and simple as possible for you guys. I met my (soon to be ex girlfriend) in a sober living about a year and a half ago. We relapsed together almost instantly, and the relationship became toxic very quickly. No trust, no boundaries, no respect, etc. Our using got out of control, so we decided to move from California to Arizona with her mother. (In an attempt to get clean, which failed) we began using again immediately, until I was arrested Dec 3rd, 2014, and charged with felony possession.

Since my arrest, I have been very serious about my recovery. This disease has dragged me through hell and back, and I finally decided I had enough. I put everything down, and surrendered Dec 4th when I was released from jail and went to a meeting.

However, she just relapsed about 3 weeks ago, so I'm looking at the disease of addiction from the ""other side"" so to speak. Its reached the point where I can't stand her or being around her AT ALL. I avoid home whenever I know she's there, because I know there are also drugs there. 

It really got to me for a while, but I've finally been able to accept the fact that she is going to run her course and make her own decisions. Unfortunately for me, I just have to sit back and watch it happen until I have the means to move out. (Steady income, etc)

I spend my days looking for work in the area, and have a room lined up for me elsewhere as soon as I can afford it. I'm excited, because I see doors opening as I continue to do the next right thing. Im just trying to trust the process and that it won't happen when I want it to happen, it will happen when its meant to happen.

Would appreciate any kind of feedback from anyone who's been in this situation, or currently is. Maybe we can share our own experiences and help each other out.

Thanks again for putting up with my (somewhat) long rant, which is really just the tip of the iceberg. If there is anyone out there who can throw their 2 cents in, please do! I want to be free from this disease. I no longer want to watch someone ruin their lives while I'm trying to better mine. Thanks for listening Reddit!",q0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: I rarely post or contribute to this sub, but I thought I'd let anyone who's struggling know that recovery IS possible.


6 months ago I overdosed on heroin for the third time in a few short months. This particular overdose scared me more than the previous two. Right as I finished the shot, I had that ""oh shit"" feeling. I knew right away I'd done way too much. My friends I was with said I had hit my head very hard on the pavement.


I came to with 3 of my friends circled around me, pushing in another shot. This one was a speed shot to try and bring me back. It did work, but I was still hardly conscious. I could see people talking to me, but couldn't hear anything or respond back. It's like I was watching myself from behind a glass wall. I had no control over my movement and couldn't communicate. It was the scariest feeling.



It's that feeling I try to remember, because its something I never want to put myself through again. A chronic relapser like me has to remember that shit. (I've been in and out of recovery since I was 22, in 2008)


These 6 months of recovery have been fucking amazing!! I started at the very bottom at a sales job, and have worked my way close to the top. Just got promoted to sales manager last week! I'm making great money, and will be in the market for my own little condo by summer.


My cravings are so few and far between compared to when I first got clean. I go to meetings daily, I have a sponsor, and I work the steps. That's the only solution for me if I want some sort of reprieve from the fucking insanity of addiction.


So if you're reading this and you're new, give recovery a try. Chances are you didn't stumble into this sub by accident. Something brought you here. I promise you now if you honestly try, your life will get better. Someone made me this promise my first day back, and guess what? It came true ;)",q0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: Got my chip a little late as I've been sick, but January 26th was my 18 months!

I've been in and out of recovery since '09 and this is the longest I've managed to stay clean. I'm far from where I want to be, but I'm not where I was. I'm not that worthless junkie pawning off my families valuables anymore. I'm not only welcome back in their house, but I'm wanted around. I don't have to wake up dopesick in the morning, wondering how I'm going to hustle to get well today. I don't have to shoplift food or sleep out in the streets. I'm employed and employable. A girl asked me as I was walking by the other day if I could take a picture of her and her friends with her phone.

All these little things, if you would have told me 18 months ago they would be a reality in my life again, I would have said you were full of shit. I was the most hopeless junkie of them all, and stopping was impossible. My last overdose and the circumstances surrounding it were rock bottom to me. I had already been to jail, and had already been to treatment. But actually dying and coming back gave me a will to live. 

While my life isn't perfect, I wouldn't trade it for a single shot of dope. I don't want the misery anymore. I'm fucking tired. I want a chance at a somewhat normal life.

If you're new to recovery, I hope you know that this shit is possible. Rock bottom is only when you decide to stop digging. Love y'all❤ ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

So if you're new to recovery and you're struggling, just know that we DO RECOVER. It's not easy by any means, but my God is it worth it. Just don't pick up one day at a time.

I got one to help cope with withdrawal and chip off Heroin, because for some reason I don't feel a craving for Oxy like I do with Heroin and as long as I do a tiny bit of opiate I can usually endure any remaining w/d symptoms.

So the oxy I got was definitely real. It was one of the OG crushable 80's and it was sick. Thats good news

I got another message that she had reupped, went and checked them out, they were thicker than my last oxy, with the same CDN 80 (Canadian, here) imprint. So I let her know, as she doesn't do them, and we ripped one open. Solid blue the full way through, slightly off from the regular blue/green of the CDN 80's, and with that I let her know that these were either a fake oxy press, likely fentanyl. 

Later on in the week I've been hearing news about seasoned opiate vets overdosing in my city again, from my pill girl AND through a call my dboy (who I havent been back to since last Thursday. wow. it's been a week) who was checking up to make sure I wasnt dead. (What a solid dude!)

Calgary, the city 3 hours south of me, has had a massive W-18 warnings, including one thats even mentioned in the /r/opiates sidebar. I think I may have come close to dying if it wasnt for my occasionally strong self control, glad I made it out with my life.

edit: if you aren't familiar with W-18, its a research chemical (?) that was originally created in a university lab, about 15 minutes from my apartment, that is approx 10,000x more powerful than IV morphine, 100x more powerful than pure Fentanyl. seeing as the creation of W-18 was a local thing, seeing it in my city really isnt a surprise to me.",q0,0,0,"1,3,5",0,4,0,0,0,0,0

I have 100mg of suboxone at home currently, and I can get more every day (I go to a pharmacy daily for my dose, and they aren't too good about watching you actually take it), do you think it's possible for me to taper down and jump off with this much suboxone?

 post: I haven't had a dream about using in almost a month, I have a sweet new job lined up with benefits and a good, healthy living wage, and I'm on track from tapering down from 16mg to 2mg of suboxone daily. My doctor even says that I was stabilized far too high at detox (which is rare from what I hear) and I'm on a taper plan where I drop 2mg per week down to 8 (currently on 10, dropping to 8 tomorrow), and 2mg every 2 weeks after that until I'm down to 2, which I'll probably stay on for a while just as a safety net as I finish getting my life together.

While I was in rehab, I met someone who was exactly like me in every way but was a year older than me, and just based on the shit he was doing, and the fact that just before detox he fucked himself up pretty bad after nodding out on xanax and a bad dose with some carfentanil in it. I didn't wanna be like that, something really clicked with me upon meeting him. I wish he stayed clean after detox so we could have hung out.

I honestly never thought I could do it, and here I am, without even a thought of using or hanging out with old friends who use. I got a lot of my core friends back, from before my addiction. Ones who don't use and are proud of the progress I've made. I also recently took a bunch of acid and thought about why I was addicted in the first place and learned a lot about myself, then I went to a glow-in-the-dark trampoline park (yes, while high on acid) and had a great time. Something I could never do while spending hundreds of dollars a day on heroin. 

I'm honestly surprised I'm doing so well solely because this is my first time ever, and statistically I should have relapsed a few times by now.

I only ask because I've heard if you are in a serious accident and are on subs, they give you fent at the hospital for pain because it DOES break through.  Any comments or advice would be nice!  Thanks guys.

I told the paramedics that she had been drinking & popping methadone.  They tried for 45 minutes unsuccessfully to revive her.

 post: So GF was having pain in her neck and of course went to shadiest doc we could fine.  So he prescribes her 4 butran patches.  They are 7 day patches that come in increments of 5ug/hr, 10ug/hr, 20ug/hr (possibly more but not looking.)

Weirdest part is, not only that I've never heard of OR seen them, But that the doc is going to prescribe bupe to a first time pain patient.  She'll be getting the 5ug ones and after research the whole thing only has about 5mg of bupe total to deliver over 7 days.   

Now I think these would be great taper devices as the dose is so low.  But has anyone had any experience with these?  Doc says it will be the same as taking 3-4 10mg vikes everyday but without the Tylenol risk.  My opinion is going to be to tell her to say they work, but make her feel kind of weird after day 4-5.  Then maybe get something better.  Thoughts please.

 post: Ok, so I know we are not legal experts here, But listen to this one..

I go to pick up my buddy because he needed a ride somewhere.  He walked to a local quik-e Mart and I picked him up there.  He used to sell A LOT of weed but he's straight now.  We both have nothing on us.  He hops in car, and we pull out and immediately a cop starts following us.  

I'm driving my girlfriends car and everything is legit on it.  Cop keeps following and as I'm about 100 feet from leaving his jurisdiction, he lights us up.  Shit.  I have a suspended license and on felony probation. I'm fucked so I pull over.  

They go right to the passenger window where he's sitting and address him by name.  It's the same cop that had tried to arrest him 2 weeks ago for a warrant that had been taken care of a month prior.  (I witnessed them trying to take him in, even though he had papers saying that the warrant was dropped.  It wasn't until a superior came and told the dick cop to let him go.)  

They pull him out of the car while 3 more cars come.  I'm shitting bricks knowing I have a probation violation just waiting to happen for the license.   They finally take me out of the car and ask for ID and I give them an ID card and not a license.   So now they know I don't have a license.  

I'm told to sit on the curb and they separate us to see if  the stories match.  They do of course and then they ask to search the car.   Now I know my gf's car is clean as a whistle but I'm hesitant at first and say it's not my car and wouldn't be comfortable with you searching it without her permission.  At this point they already ran my ID and know I'm on probation so they ask me again or they'll call my PO and search it anyway and have the car towed.  I can't have my gf's car towed.  By this time both of us have been physically searched.

So I ask them the reason they pulled me over and they say ""suspicious activity. Your friend here hopped out of a car and right into yours.  Looks like a drug deal to me"".  So I then said ""ok I'll let you search if you can do my a solid and just let my gf pick up the car and not give me the suspended license violation.""   They respond saying we won't tow the car.   Whatever. I know it's clean and give them permission.

  They tear threw it and find nothing.  Then to my utmost surprise they say"" your ID is on the seat, have your girlfriend come down and get the car.. if it's here in an hour it'll be towed.  Have a nice evening""    

UH WHAAAAAT?!?!   So holy fuck. . No ticket.  No probation violation.  No nothing.  So we waited 20 minutes and then just took off because they was no way my gf was gonna walk 3 miles to get the car.  

Do you guys think the stop was bullshit so that's why they let it go?  I personally think it's because they are harassing my friend and now they are 0-2 on trying to pop him.  I'm so thankful now that I'm home and such, but it just seems so odd that I'd like opinions on it.

 post: Maybe its the withdrawl, maybe I'm just crazy, maybe I don't have what it takes to overcome my issues. To be completly honest, my life before dope was not at all enjoyable. Depression, anxiety, a false sense of feeling accepted by my peers. Jumping from therapist, to psychiatrist, to psychologist to neurologist. I've taken almost every anti-depressant there is, all made me worse, the worst of all was effexor, that shit made me want to kill people. I am not at all a fighter, more like a weak lover. Dr's refused to precribe me any anti-anxiety meds because of fear of abuse. so precribing me busipirone was a joke.  Weed makes me more anxious, counter-effective. Alcohol was OK, got into homebrewing beer. A fun hobby but costly, and futher places me down the path of alcoholism. I though fine, being an alcoholic was OK, it was acceptable, destroying my body from the inside out. So I said F it, lets graduate to the dark side and start doing H. Escaping my problems. I've attempted to admit myself to the psyciatric institute a couple years ago, was triaged and then  essentailly laughed at becuase I wasn't a threat because I wasn't suicidal. I have you ever tried to get help and was told to essentailly F off? Yea, I can't keep a steady job, I go to school, I am broke. Getting high and nodding off was the answer, the perfect escape. Going to NA meeting, getting nothing out of it. Going to rehab, being ridiculed by the others because my problems were so ""minor"" to theirs. No love, false friends, parents disowning me. So, i would roll with the punches, becoming a loner, further isolating myself, doing more drugs, being an even shittier person, because I have been treated like shit most of my life. Being bullied is high school, retaliating, suspensions, detentions, etc. High school = nightmare. I am 31 now, yea, that shit still affects me. So, now I'm trying to get clean, but why? I don't want to be a slave to drugs? I suppose. Having dreams of killing myself, but don't have the balls to go thru with it. Escape was the answer. Confronting my problems will most definitely make my life worse. Sometimes change can go for the worse. I want to get this monkey off my back, but I feel I am nothing without some sort of monkey attached to me. Loneliness exacerbates my problems, using made my loneliness go away, which was the goal. What the fuck is wrong with me? I would like to get past w/d and go back to pre-using and stick with the ocassional MDMA experience, therapeutic dosage,  maybe some LSD, which I have been storing in my fridge will help me get in touch with my inner self that I am unable to obtain now. However, I am not ready to take that trip, not mentally, not emotionally prepared, but maybe it's what I need to change, have some spiritual experience that will make me focus on my full potential, if I have any. My problem has always been a lack of creativity, no drive or ingenuity, I just don't see the world as ""normal"" people do. My therapist gave up, said I wasn't trying hard enough, turns out I do not have the ability to grow as a person, or maybe I don't get it so further down the spiral I went. Where is rock bottom? Is this it? Can I go lower? Friends I thought who cared about me only laughed behind my back about my problems. I have no-one to turn to. If your reading this, be glad your not me. About 5 years ago, was having serious stomach pain, after seeing dr's, getting colonoscopy resulted in polyps which will turn cancerous some day, having to be checked every 5 years til i'm dead. Dr said I needed to stop whatever it was that was causing the problem, stress was the cause. Stress from my shitty job, yeah, my fucking job was literally killing me. How do I cope with this stress? Well, flipping out at work and getting fired solved that problem, only to cause 5 more problems. On and off of unemployment, going back to school, racking up more debt. Is this the answer? I guess being happy is the goal, I haven't been happy since I was maybe 12. Fuck my life. I exercise regularly, I try to do good, but that isn't for me, I don't feel any sense of gratification from helping others. I'm a bad person, seriously, I enjoy other people suffering. When I was like 10 my mom would always say to me, ""misery loves company, don't try to drag anyone into your problems."" Yes, more traumatic childhood experiences, my life is so fucked. My father kicking me out of the car in the middle of nowhere while on vacation when I was 15, left to just walking down the street 100's of miles away from home, some scary shit, my mom came back for me about a day later, as I found an overpass to shelter under. Sorry for making you read all this. You think you have problems? I'm not going for browine points here, but fuck, this is what my life has become.

ironsoul412,OpiatesRecovery,2cgdn8,8/2/2014 17:58,0,1,"title: Just got out of inpatient rehab .
 post: Where to start..... I've been doing ECP hard for the last year. But only started shooting like 3 mo ago. Anyways, I was physically addicted and was basically using to not be sick so I could function, go to work, etc, you know how it goes. Back on June 30 I gave my dude a ride and he gave 7 bags for the ride. After dropping him off, was driving home and I was pulled over for ""wreckless driving"" the cop said I was swerving. I dunno. I wasn't even high. So they told me they had probable cause and raided me and my car. Found the bags and then took me to their station. They tried to get me to set up a sting with my dealer. I didn't cooperate. They didn't lock the bags in evidence so when they weren't looking I took the bags and tried to dispose of them..tried to flush then on the toilet in the cell. It wouldn't flush, maybe it wasn't turned on? I dunno. 

So the cops got the bags, kicked my ass and threw me back in the cell over night then transferred me to the county jail. I was in hardcore, white knuckle, cold turkey withdrawal(puking, shitting, cold sweats, can't get comfortable, etc). Was stuck in processing for 3 days. Once I got thru the preliminary hearing my bond was 5k., so %10, OK I got $500 . promptly called a relative to bail me out. They did. I was released at 3am with one other guy who also happens to be a dope dealer. He gave me a ride home, smoked a blunt with me, his phone# and gave me $5 for smokes. Lesson here is not all dope dealers are dicks. 

Anyways, so 4am rolls around. I'm dopesick as shit and I have some suboxone in my apt. While I was in jail somebody tried to break into my apt and broke my doorknob. Trying to fix the door, looks like I'm trying to break into my own apt. Still had my jail wristband on and the cops drive by. Luckily they didn't stop, seriously hate police. Finally like 20 mins later I get in. Go up and found some trammys I forgot I had. Took 200mg and .2 clonidine and ate some food. I immediately puked then immediately shit my brains out. Afterwards I laid on the bathroom floor crying in the fetal position for like 5 mins. So I crawl back out to my living room and eat a whole 8mg strip of Sub. Sweet relief. Thank god. 

So I wait til the morning and get a relative to drive me to  inpatient rehab
 I was admitted and did a 5 day subutex taper. After that I did 25 days of 3b rehab. The subutex taper didn't even touch me. 2mg ever 4 hours and I was still dope sick as shit for like 3 weeks. my insurance sucks and denied my attempt to get into a halfway house or 3/4 house. Luckily my parents were willing to take me back. Btw I'm 32 and a complete fuckup. NA meeting everyday and IOP that starts next week. 

I've been to hell and back. My life is fucked. Lost my car to the impound, license will be suspended, bank account drained by the relative who bailed me out. Lost my job while I was in rehab, was collecting unemployment too and my funds got depleted the day I went to jail. Phone shut off no money to pay the bill. Lawyer fees, court costs, etc... Trying to pick up the pieces and this is so fucking hard to do.all I can say is I'm 33 days clean and will be hitting up a meeting tonight. I'm out of town visiting my extended family for the weekend. 20 people and all of them drink HEAVILY, triggers man, triggers, i don't have a problem with booze but I don't want to drink either and fuck up my recovery. Fuck this is hard. Buckle the fuck down and ride out the storm. Shit. 

My spirit shines bright, it blinds my adiction into submission. However, this cannot be sustained and my addiction wiill attack at my weakest moment.

 post: So, as some of you may know, I have been struggling with addiction for quite some time now. I went to inpatient rehab for 30 days, managed to stay clean for 2 months after that and then I ended up relapsing. I still go to IOP and NA meetings but I just can't seem to stop relapsing. I mean at this point I've used everyday for a week and now get withdrawals again. I have zero money, no car, and locked myself in a hotel room for a week. I isolated myself on purpose and all I have to cope with this is clonidine. My last time I used was yesterday morning. So, today is Saturday around noon I'm at the 24+ mark and the withdrawals are getting pretty bad. I puked alot this morning. The depression is seriously driving me crazy. I don't know what to do. All I can think about is shooting dope but since I have no way to cop, no money, no car its not happening. I feel so sick. I wish I had some suboxone or something to get me thru this. I know loperdimide is the way to go. But I have no money to buy it. I don't want to say it but I may shoplift some today, which is terrible but I'm at the end of my wits and I have no idea what to do. Please help!

 post: I'm doing the right thing. Doing IOP everyday, staying clean, hitting meetings daily and really trying to make progress. I'm learning to let go of the past but its so fucking hard to actually do. Panic attacks and the emotional rollercoaster are taking their toll on me. I'm living in a recovery house away from home. Separating myself from the people, places and things that I know will lead back to relapse. I was lying in bed and doing the worst thing possible, jump on Facebook and look at pics of my gf from back home. That Pandoras box of sweet memories is opened. I start to remember the great times, the quality time we spent together, the LOVE that we both had for each other. Years of rehashed memories. Those tainted memories involving drug use and severe codependency relations. It was not healthy but we both made it work. Very surreal and delusional. Now, as I am trying to live a life of recovery, I must come to terms that the past is over, those times will never happen again. Using was fun. This is my weakness. I know she's back home enjoying life, probably using, maybe moved on. The problem is I still love her. Shit hurts. Missing her, not being there, the jealously, the envy that her and my other friends are living life, enjoying it. In contrast, I'm far from home not enjoying it, the loneliness, the fear of missing out, that fact that my life is on pause since I cannot buck the system and take my life back yet. This is a true test of patience. The main problem that I see is my resentment towards her, that fear that since I'm not around she will move on. I'm trying to save a dwindling relationship. Let go. Let go. Move on. I/E turns to E/I as self-relience takes control. Trust issues, losing that which we put some much time and effort into.
Epihany!! My past is only a story and once I realize this, it has no power over me. So, that buffer to my emotions is removed, the drugs are gone, the dope is a distant memory. The hardest thing for me to do is ask for help. I'm hitting that wall we recovering addicts speak of. When the novelty of early recovery is over. The gears shift and leave me feeling alone. Sorry for the wall of text, on my phone. How do you guys deal with the fallout from the huge life change that is of a recovering addict?",q24,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0
ironsoul412,OpiatesRecovery,2qinso,12/27/2014 3:09,0,2,"title: Recovery, relationships and saving eachother .
 post: Let me start off by stating that I am extremely greatful to have another day sober! This sub and my sober network have been a huge help for me through these trying times. When I say trying times I mean the holidays. I have 93 days clean today!! Huge accomplishment for me, this is the longest I've been clean ever. I'm 32 and have been using drugs/alcohol in many forms since I was about 14.  I've come to terms with my past, I no longer have that shame that comes with realizing that I am indeed an Addict, with a capital A. Using was my coping skill for life's shit. It was my go to, how ironic that using was causing my life to be shit. Putting my family and friends through hell just so I can keep on using. It was my everything. Been through rehab, relapse, jail, more rehabs, etc. Rinse and repeat, fuck rinsing, just repeat. That old saying, runs get shorter , consequences get greater and I didn't give a fuck. As long as I could feed the monster inside of me, as long as my addiction was satisfied, relationships didn't matter anymore. That was the old me. Now, with some clean time, finally getting past the uneasiness of early recovery, I'm starting to have a better view on my life. The pessimism, insecurity, overwhelming feelings of inadequacy and failure as a person are starting to dissipate. I'm coming to terms with myself. The hardest thing for me to do is to stop resenting myself for allowing my addiction to control me. I'm starting to accept who I am. I truely feel that I had to completely destroy myself to really find out who I am. I am not a failure, I am not an evil person, I am not a victim!! The anxiety and depression is lifting. Like a weight being taken off my chest.
I live in a recovery house. Over the past week I've seen 4 people relapse, get caught, kicked out, homeless or back in rehab, the vicious circle of bullshit continues. I know they are really trying to get this but the holidays are extremely hard, the emotional pain is killer for some and too overwhelming . they stopped going to meetings, started isolating , you know the signs, totally saw it coming for them. I tried to talk to them before the relapse but ultimately its their decision. I will not take any blame as I tried to help. If an addict is going to relapse, absolutely nothing can be said and no amount of consequences will stop them. All I can do is pray that they will get this and stop beating themselves up for going back out.
Let me switch gears. I've met a girl who is also in recovery. An ex-junkie just like me. She REALLY wants this, incredibly sincere about staying clean. Basicslly, she's in the same boat as me, lost her nursing job, legal problems, living in a recovery house etc. She's been through hell and doesn't want to be a junkie anymore. She wants her life back, to be a nurse again, to do the thing that she is passionate about, helping others. So, we've been dating for 2 months. Yeah, red flags. I know. We help each other stay clean. Support %100. Right from the start we have been totally honest about EVERYTHING. Our past, our dreams, everything. The basis of our relationship is based on honesty and trust. The support we give to each other is honestly what has kept me clean through these rough patches. Without her care and support I probably would have relapsed. And vice versa. Its truly special. I have no need to try and be somebody I'm not in fear of rejection. Helping her helps me. Together we have a chance of getting this right. Her parents have exiled her, refuse to even acknowledge that she is alive, let alone that she is clean and sober today. It breaks my heart that she cries about the falling out. I have no idea how to help her other than be there for her. I have provided the love and support that she needs and in return she has helped me immensely with my emotional state. I thank god for people like her in my life because if I relied on my housemates to stay clean, I'd be out there relapsing with them! What can I do to help her deal with the zero support from her family that she so desperately needs??

 post: I'm not new to recovery, been at this for 4+ years. I get some clean time, 6 months or so then go back out. Riding that pink cloud of recovery. Been in and out of rehabs, psych wards, homeless, jail, couch surfing, recovery houses, etc...

This time it feels different, I feel more hopeless than before. I have zero inspiration, no goals, just this overwhelming feeling of no matter what I do, I will fuck up. Its easier to not ever try than try and fail again. I don't have urges to use heroin, but strong cravings for benzos and adderall. The anxiety and stress double team me and I'm helpless. Oh, and can't forget the addiction that reinforces the hopelessness. Its a war on 2 fronts. I feel like Hitler at the end of WW2. Suicide seems like a way out.

I was in rehab back in Feb.-March. I was detoxing off suboxone. I was on Sub maint. for 4 months prior. I was dopesick the entire month in rehab. I got out, went to a recovery house, got a job, moved out, relapsed on dope again. Went on a run for a couple months. I ended up kicking the dope habit with xanax. I did xanax hard for a couple months then when I was trying to quit that I had a seizure from the withdrawl. Psych ward wouldnt admit me because of the seizure so I checked back into another rehab. It was my 5th rehab. I stayed there for 2 months. I got out and now I'm in another recovery house. No job, no money, nothing. 

I have no motivation and I feel lost. Who am I? I was an addict for so long thats who I've become. Now that I'm clean, I have no identity, no dreams, no goals, no reason to exist. Nothing makes me happy. I'm bi-polar and emotional stability cannot be achieved. I'm on some hardcore psych meds to keep me ""stable"" which in and of itself has its consequences. Thorazine, Elavil, and Depakote. It;s overkill, like killing an ant with a cinder block.

 post: Well some of you probably seen me posting on here trying to get this done and be sober so I can live a good life and I'm failing miserably lol... I thank you guys though as a lot of my questions have been answered as I'm reaching for sobriety. 

So now that I have some things figured out in my head as now I'm just doing dope to stay unsick (because that's all I can afford, and honestly I have no desire to feel that high anymore) I'm just fucking so done, but this all started when pain management took a whole year to try medications on me that I've I've already taken before and know don't fucking work and I was just fed up with being in pain and knowing my next appointment in 3 months I'll be given nurontin or some bullshit synthetic that is just if not worse as opioids. So I finally said fuck it and started medicating myself as someone came into my life that had this stuff everyday anytime of the day. And when I say I'm in pain I'm in fucking pain from my original disease.

So when I get sober, when do I know what's withdrawal pain and what is my disease pain as I forgot how it is to be sober. And how are they going to treat this pain, I was just as a mess as before I started doing dope hence why I said fuck it what do I have to lose when I started popping oxys. Well I understand that made it 30x worse. I'm eating 20 mix of pills (clonodine, diazepam, visteril, tylonal and whatever helps until my dealer wakes up) and that barely keeps the WD at bay. if I don't fix the problem that led up to this problem I feel it's a recipe for failure. Although feeling this withdrawal I think I will never even look at a opioid again. I have every medication that a detox has and I know when to administer them. I just can't seem to get it fucking done, I can't leave my girlfriend alone by herself, and some other issues I have with professional detox. 

And one more thing, I'm also detoxing from clonopin as I recently got switched to diazepam, and I still can't decipher which is what withdrawal because I find myself barely taking my Valium when I'm doing dope. It's a whole fucking mess and I hate doctors so I came here. There's a reason I hate doctors and the (professionals) The thoughts of ""the easy way out"" are creeping in as my situation is so fucked.

 post: I think that for most, the physical withdrawal symptoms are miserable, but bearable. I have to say, I have been *much* sicker with the flu, than I ever was with opiate withdrawal. 

But the difference lies in the possessiveness of lady H. When we are addicts, we are enslaved to the drug. It is our #1 top priority, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. (it was for me anyways)

When we try to kick the habit, we become physically ill. (Albeit cruel & unusual punishment for taking a step in the right direction) Now the illness itself is uncomfortable at best, & miserable at worst. Yet, we still manage to function pretty well, all things considered. Therefor, it is not the physical symptoms that are incapacitating us.

The problem is, that lady H is a very possessive, & jealous lover. Even when we are broken up, she is out to make your life miserable. She still wants to be your #1 priority. ""till death do us part"" kind of shit. 

If I had a cold, I would be able to distract/occupy myself enough to be indifferent to my cold. In full blown opiate withdrawal, I am lucky to get  an hour of sleep without her constantly on the front of my mind. She just won't GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

That all, is what I think makes opiate withdrawal unique.

The mods are assholes for doing this & I would have rather seen reddit ban/quarantine r/opiates all together before seeing the mods try to censor their own community. it feels like a betrayal to me & that is why I am leaving. It was nice knowing you wonderful opiate addicts & I wish you all the best. Except the mods who disabled pictures. I hope you guys stub your toe *really hard* when you get out of bed tomorrow.

 post: Forgive me if this post shouldn't be here, but I've been a long time lurker and I love the compassion on this sub.

To try and make a really long story shorter, I've been caring for my uncle who is completely bedridden with multiple sclerosis. For the past three years, I made the 40 minute drive from my  apartment to his house to be with him and take care of him all day, for free and on my own time, Monday through Friday.

 Well, I knew his end would come eventually, and sooner than we would both like, but he died rather suddenly 10 days ago. For so long, I took care of business. I took care of the house, the bills, the shopping, the cleaning, the cooking, and my uncle-in every way imaginable. The only thing he was able to control was his voice and his right thumb. My uncle was my friend, my therapist, my father figure...for those last three years, he was my world. 

Besides my wonderful fiance, my uncle was the only one I could be completely honest with about my opiate addiction. He wanted me to be clean and happy so badly. This was a guy who (being bedridden, unable to move, and in constant pain) was so fucking generous that he would offer me his last morphine or fentanyl patch and happily go without his meds if it meant ME not being dope sick. My junkie ass didn't even HAVE to steal from him, he would have sacrificed everything for me anyway. That's just the kind of guy he was. 

I don't know where I'm going with this, it hurts to even type this out. I feel so empty and lost, and on top of that I'll be out of drugs tomorrow, as my only supplier was my uncle. 

Getting into fentanyl these past couple years has given me an astronomical tolerance. I was doing about 350mcg of fent in about 2-3 days. I really fucked myself here guys. I don't know what I'm hoping for or asking for with this post, I guess I'm just fucking terrified. I have about 100mgs of methadone I acquired and a seemingly endless supply of gabapentin. I know I can do this if I have to, but I'm not ready. I'm terrified of losing the numbness of drugs because I already feel destroyed by the loss of my uncle, and I know it's only going to get worse when I start really feeling again. 

I feel dead inside, I feel empty inside. I want my life back, and I want my uncle back. To anyone who read this, thank you for listening. ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

 post: As the title says, I have 29 days today, and it feels incredible. Every day feels better than the last. It's so bizarre, even though every now and then I'll have slight physical symptoms, it does nothing to stop my happiness. Every time I think  about something beautiful or something or someone I love, I get this feeling deep in my chest and it's so powerful that it almost hurts. It feels so good to really feel again, and it's real. It's the most real, honest thing I've ever felt and it just makes me feel so lucky to be on this fucked up, beautiful planet. 

It blows my mind that I'm sitting in an apartment two hours away from home and I can stay as long as I want because I don't have a chemical tethering me to a specific place. I don't have to rush home or hide in the bathroom to get high before I eat or have a conversation or blink my fucken eyes. I won't lie, I loved opiates. I loved every single second of every high, but I just love life more than drugs now. I remember googling things like, ""Will I ever be happy again after opiates?"" because I was convinced that the dark days were my new constant state. Looking back just a few short weeks, I don't even recognize that sad person that I was. 

When I was using, I thought everyone who was clean and sober had boring, meaningless lives and they were all fucking nuts for saying they were happier without drugs. What an arrogant, judgemental asshole I was. I was wrong, it's way better on the other side and I'm the fool for thinking otherwise. I've said this before and I'll probably say it forever, but everyone in this community has helped me immensely whether they know it or not. To anyone out there still in that dark place, you won't be there forever, you can have it all if you just want it bad enough. ",q0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: I'm so stoked, I have 135 days today. It's been quite the experience to say the least. Things are  awesome these days, I exercise a lot lately, watch what I eat, and cancel both of those things out by smoking way too many cigarettes. I made another post when I was around 30 days clean about how happy I was. Everyone claimed it was the ""pink cloud"" I was on, and someone even suggested I was having some kind of bipolar episode. That last one honestly sent me into a panic and I spent the rest of that day terrified that my happiness wasn't actually real. Well, I'm still pretty fucken happy on a regular basis, although I have shitty days just like everyone else, but that's life and it's to be expected. The bad craving days I've had have been caused by anger 99% of the time. I'm still working on better ways to deal with anger as I'm still pretty early into recovery and as everyone knows, our coping skills aren't the sharpest during this time. 

This is my first time quitting in my 8 years of using and I haven't relapsed so far. I quit cold turkey and I don't go to NA/AA. I'm ridiculously proud of this. Aside from my fiance who couldn't be more supportive, I only have one other sober friend on this journey. We live on different sides of the country but I've felt closer to him than I have to anyone in years. Keel, I love you and appreciate you more than you could ever possibly know. Our relationship means the world to me. 
 
My favorite thing about being clean is being able to be spontaneous and explore my home state of California without having that tight leash of addiction around my neck, keeping me  tethered to wherever the drugs are. To the people who are just starting out in recovery and attempting to quit, just keep going. Everyone on here is right about it being better. Drink the fucken kool aid and come to the other side. Drugs are great and fun and numbing, we all know this, but they aren't nearly as good as sobriety feels. I've had numerous chances to relapse but I haven't, because I don't want to, I don't want that life again, and because every good day I've had sober has made every hour I spent sick in withdrawal worth it. I wouldn't change any of it. ",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"0,29",2,0,0,0

 post: Holy shit, time flies. Sometimes I look at my calendar and I still can't believe I've actually made it this far. I just looked back on a post I made on r/opiates when I was just about to quit  fentanyl and it made me kinda sad, kinda happy. Sad because I'll never forget the pain I was feeling during that time and happy for so many reasons...that I tried, that I made it farther than I  ever believed I could, and that I DID end up getting my life back.

The past seven months has been crazy. I've travelled the country, made new friends, lost a couple, crashed my car into a bus, (completely sober, it figures) and got a new pet. I've had amazing experiences and terrible ones. Life is both great and awful whether you're high or not, but at least when you're not it's actually real. There's been alot of bitching and complaining on my end the past couple months and I'm trying to change that. It's really just a matter of reminding myself that the world doesn't owe me shit, and looking in the mirror and saying, ""Suck it the fuck up buttercup."" It might not make everything all better, but it makes me try harder, and THAT makes me feel better.

The things I've been doing to maintain my sobriety are staying connected to the people I love, especially the few that know about my addiction. On the rare occasions that I get cravings, I talk about it openly to my fiance. We'll usually make some tasteless joke about how much of a junkie I was and that helps to move my thoughts in a different direction. Laughing seems to help me alot. I celebrate small victories, like the first time I went to the movies in 8 years without being high. It felt SO good to not fall asleep in the theater because I was high as fuck. I celebrated when I found a fentanyl patch in my room at two-ish months clean and was able to throw that shit in the trash. We should all pat ourselves on the back for personal accomplishments like that. I work out every day, and I take a walk every day. To everyone in early recovery, the people who tell you that exercise is the best thing you can do for yourself are right. Trust me, I laughed and said fuck all that...until I actually became desperate enough to try it. It works.

I don't want to ramble on, just wanted to share this milestone with everyone and congratulate myself because I'm pretty fucken pumped on my progress! I've said this before, but I want to say again that every single person on here who has ever posted, commented or messaged with me has helped me. I really feel like I've struggled and cried and laughed and succeeded and celebrated with every one of you, and I owe a big chunk of my sobriety to you guys.

I also want to say one more thing to the people who have ""only"" accumulated a day or so: that's a bullshit attitude. You earned that fucking day, it was horrible and scary and sad but you did it. Alot of people can't even make it that far, so pull yourself up by your bootstraps and do it again tomorrow. We're all badasses! ",q0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

I usually try to break up my shit as fine as possible and split it up into an even amount of lines all of the same size. I then take turns blowing one line at a time up *each* nostril.

Sometimes I have a really stuffy nostril and despite attempts to clear it, it remains too plugged up to blow anything. On these occasions I say 'fuck it' and just blow all of it up the one nostril that isnt plugged up and try my best to avoid over shooting and creating a wasteful drip. 

During the latter instance do you guys think I'm absorbing *less* of the drug than if I had managed to successfully split it up amongst both of my nostrils?

So basically my question is, barring tolerance, do your nostrils absorb less over time due to damage from the drugs in a similar way to IV'in where your veins eventually collapse and are no longer viable?

I ask this because my tolerance is getting up there. At around a half gram to get where I want. I feel like the amount of powder I need to inhale at this point must be fucking my nostrils at least a little. Definitely less hair in there compared to a year ago lol.

 post: Hey guys, I've been off this sub for about 8 months now due to getting my act together and getting sober. Just didn't wanna risk certain things triggering me as well losing any interest in the life style.

Getting sober was the hardest thing I've ever gone through in my life and this is coming from someone whose been sexually abused countless times and grew up in an extremely dysfunction and abusive household. 

With that said I just found out one of my closest friends might have a problem with opiates and that in conjunction with another close friend who I know is going through it all is just breaking my heart.

I'm not saying stop using and getting high. That is entirely up to you and I'm the first to advocate for responsible drug use. Just take a moment and make an objective assessment of where you're at today, where you were years past, and where you'd like to be in a few years. If you're not happy with what you find then maybe consider a change. 

Like I said I love all of you and wish you all the best. Like my father always said; ""We're all doing the best we can in the reality we're living in.""

 post: Seems like **forever**. I was on opiates for about 2 years after my accident, and stupidly decided to quit cold turkey instead of taper off. I told myself I wasn't taking *that* much (5'7"", 105lb, 120mg vicodin/day + 20-24mgDilaudid/day), so ""I shouldn't even WD and I'll just will myself into being fine."" So, I went through the WD, chills/sweating, upset stomach, yawning, dilated pupils, sneezing, crazy anxiety, insomnia. This lasted maybe 2 weeks. Again, writing that feels unbelievable... feels like it's been MONTHS of this.

Now, my stomach is better but I could just stay up all night, every night. And I do. 4/7 are all-nighters, and the ""sleep"" I get is basically seething/sweating/rolling around. It's the insomnia and anxiety that are getting me. I can't tell if my heart starts racing first, and makes me FEEL anxious, or if I'm so anxious I cause my heart to race. These panic attacks last like 12 hours, and nothing I can do stops them. I could just cry all day!

My father saw me, got worried, and asked if he could take my blood pressure. It's ""hard to watch"" me be like this. The blood pressure is perfect, but my resting heart rate was over 100bpm. No wonder I don't feel well!  

I've done a few projects around the house, and have my son ready for starting school. When I'm busy I'm sort of OK. I fixed up the exhaust on my car and changed the spark plugs, and I'm being a good mom. but other than that, I'm just so sad and constantly freaking out all the time, plus lightheaded and exhausted. 

There are a shitload of reasons I could the anxiety, lack of opiates aside. I was just wondering if you guys have any kind words or something. It was so bad that I went to a doctor, terrified and thinking something was really wrong with me, convinced I might be going to die. Going fuckin crazy here.",q0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: I'm starting over in my recovery after about 6 months of true clean time/working a program. I got away from NA, didn't have a sponsor, isolated myself, and got cripplingly depressed, so you know what happened. I slipped slowly, but you know how that goes, too. My one year would have been May 29th.   

My biggest problem is the guilt, shame, self-loathing and regret that comes with this lifestyle. I've hurt so many people, so very much. I also have a lot of grief for those friends I've lost to this.

But I can not get better if I don't learn to forgive myself. The past is the past, and I can't change it. All I can do right now, in early recovery, is work on loving and forgiving myself.

I get a lot of terrible, incredibly dark thoughts; I try to counter them with their opposite. 

I've done terrible things! But I'm not a terrible person. 

I've hurt and been hurt; but I can heal, and help heal others. 

I'm worthless! No, I'm not, and I'm alive and I have potential. 

I hate myself! No... I must forgive myself. I'm gonna keep saying it until I feel it. 

These are just thoughts and feelings; I squashed and ran from them by using all these years, and now must move through them. They can't kill me, but I do know what will, and I'm lucky to be alive and do not want to die.

I send positive energy to you, right now, and I hope you feel it. It is real.

I am in Michigan where Medical Marijuana is legal but according to the Suboxone maintenance group I cannot be caught pissing dirty for Marijuana or I will get cut off. I am; however, going to be moving to California with my mom in a few weeks where Marijuana is recreational. Are the rules different for Suboxone maintenance down there? Will I be able to smoke weed?

Either I don't take enough in my dream to get high, or something happens where I can't administer the dope. I've had dreams where I get black tar, mix it all up and then the syringe breaks and I can't find a new one. I had a really long using dream last night where multiple things happened where I couldn't get high. Like I scraped some old dope from the joint papers my dealer used to use to package his dope but then I added in the ""new"" dope that I bought and it was just like powdered sugar so I messed up the whole batch. Then I ended up finding more papers to scrape and for some reason it all ended up on my shirt and I was thinking I could still salvage it but then water spilled on me... It's just crazy off the wall stuff. I wake up frustrated, pissed and upset.

I've been clean over a month now but when I went to rehab everyone there told me that they could get high in their dreams and that it was weird that I couldn't. I even met a girl in a NA meeting that told me that she could get super high in her dreams and even feel the needle.

 post: and I finally feel like i'm getting my life back together. Don't get me wrong, i'm still severely broken, but i'm getting there. I hit rock bottom and lost everything and i'm slowly getting it back thanks to suboxone. I know some don't consider that totally clean, but I take it correctly and it literally makes it so I can live my life.

I decided to start slow with a job and got a job at a finance department at a company where I live. They really love me there and want to keep me full-time. it definitely makes me feel good. I've continued to stay clean, I've bought a car and i've dealt with the financial ruin that I have caused. I'm pretty proud of myself.

I know I have to work more on my mental health. I have an appointment on the 24th that i've had for over a month to see a psychiatrist because I know I need something fro my depression and OCD. It just seems like every little bad thing that could happen though is happening.

I got stopped today and told my car could be towed because my car isn't valid (not my fault, it's the dealerships and a long story). I had to miss work to fix the issue and I'm still working on my license (apparently it's still suspended even though i've paid my fines). I gave my online ""boyfriend"" or whatever you want to call him an ""out"" from our relationship because I felt like I was losing him and he took it. That has been super hard on me because I literally put my all into my relationships. I know I wasn't perfect but I still tried to communicated with him and he just didn't communicate with me at all. He literally didn't tell me anything was upsetting him so we didn't discuss anything and obviously it turned into a problem. Apparently that is all of my fault though. I will take the high road and just stay away from him though because I honestly can't see him right now, it's too hard. I unfortunately think he is too immature to do the same because he can't admit he did anything anything or that he might be part of the problem. His next girlfriend can deal with that though because i'm working on loving myself. Even though it does fucking hurt like hell, I know that I am worth more respect than what I was given and he had completely given up. it's not a fun relationship when the other person isn't even in it anymore and won't tell you why. 

I had saved up money to go see him, or was saving up money. Like $300 only saved so far, but I am going to use it on a mini vacation to go to san franscisco and visit a couple of my friends to go to the bar and clubbing or something. Just a long weekend away to let loose and have some fun. 

Of course this and all of my car issues has led to more stress and i've been having more bad dreams but aside from my first initial thought of using and quickly realizing I'm on suboxone, it passed. Plus I'm not going to ruin 8 months of being clean from heroin over a stupid car and someone that is immature and too full of himself too see he can be an issue. 

When everything seems to be falling down though, what do you guys do to keep going? I know I need support right now and i've been trying to tap into all of my resources just to be prepared. I've been walking daily, working, keeping busy, keeping away from the things that are upsetting me, etc. I just need a little boost or pick me up to get me over this little setback I guess. I'm not going to let this ruin the progress I've been making. I'm a better person that that, i'm smarter than that and i can't do that to the people that I still love.

 post: I guess I'm just looking for a little extra support.

I am on suboxone maintenance but I have been clean from heroin a year on May 22nd. 

I would be proud of myself except when it came out that I was a heroin addict to my family, it motivated my cousin to go to our family and admit that she was struggling with her sexuality and with alcoholism too. She said she wouldn't have done it if I wouldn't have gotten help. She went to rehab and had gotten sober from alcohol. She was in the National Guard, had graduated certified in chemical weaponry iirc. I was so proud of her. She had always looked up to me and followed in my foot steps but this past year we had really bonded and looked to each other for support. We would text or snap each other telling each other that we were proud of each other and that we motivated each other. She was a HUGE support to me. Just having her look up to me and having her be motivated by me made me want to keep doing good.

Well, May 2nd of this year was my 29th birthday. My last birthday in my 20's and 20 days shy of one year clean of heroin. It started out as a normal day but ended up the worst day of my life. I'm not sure when it happened, but my cousin had fallen off the wagon at some point and had killed herself on my birthday. This really, really, really, fucked with me. I'm SLOWLY getting better but there was a solid month where I didn't know if I was coming or going. The only reason I didn't relapse was because I knew she would be disappointed in me. I blamed myself. I have a lot of regrets regarding my cousin that I can't get over. I know that I need to go to counseling to really work through this and that is my plan, I just have to get some things out of the way first, one mainly being my dog's surgery. Which I took care of yesterday. My dog is like my kid and I was really worried about her. Now that that is off my plate, I thought I could relax some but my ex seems to have impeccable timing and decided to text me after months of no contact. 

I'm trying to stay healthy, and on the right path. For the last year I've been talking to a guy that I did absolutely fall in love with but he didn't feel the same about me and I could hear it in his voice. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me because it just makes me feel bad about myself, so I broke it off. It still fucking hurts really fucking bad, but I can't force him to love me. It's sad though because a lot of our issues are internet related (we were long distance) and i'm sure if we lived near each other those things wouldn't even be an issue.... Anyway, the ex from my heroin days is texting me again. Apparently he is doing good and I'm glad he is doing good but I feel like he is trying to squeeze his way back into my life again and I know for a fact that this cannot happen. We were toxic for each other. I know this. I hate that he is hurting over me, but if we ever ended up together again, which we won't, it would end VERY bad. I told him yesterday that I didn't want him to get any ideas of us getting back together and to start calling me and obsessing over me and he said that he wouldn't, he just needed a friend and I know the most about him (we lived together 10 years). That would be believable if there wasn't 20 texts from him on my phone this morning and for the fact that he has been texting me all fucking day. I am trying to stay on the right path but with everything negative that's happened recently - breaking up with the guy i'm really in love with, my dogs surgery, my cousins death, etc., I hope I'm strong enough to put a stop to this.. I really do. Any suggestions are welcome.. I need the help. ",q0,0,0,0,4,0,"1,0",0,0,0,0

Most recently, my good buddy Ken wrote about what his life is like after being clean for 3 whole years! Check it out here:

We also have a Facebook page, in case anyone is interested in connecting with us in real life! Feel free to leave a post or whatever! We're all based in Orange County, California.
https://www.facebook.com/nerdysoberhipsters/

I hope that whoever reads this might be able to relate! Our main message is that it's possible to be young and clean, and still enjoy life to the fullest!!

My name is David and I've been clean and sober for over 4 years. I've posted here several times before and people generally seem to enjoy our articles, so I wanted to invite everyone to come check out our site, in the hope that you may be able to relate to some of the stories we share there.

Here's an article I just wrote, to give you a bit of an introduction on who we are and what we do. Obviously, addiction and early sobriety can be really lonely sometimes. If you don't have people around who share their lives with you, maybe you can get a little bit of that feeling from reading something on our blog. You're not alone!!! Love you all!!

 post: so i thought this would bite me in the ass but since i go to aa and na i have two sponsors. the aa one just celebrated two years, the na sponsor celebrated 21 years.

now, the aa sponsor is getting through the steps with me at a good pace, i have 59 days and am almost done with the fourth step. the na sponsor has many sponsees with lots of clean time.

however, na sponsor sees me at the gym and says that my aa sponsor is selling opiates (which he says is true, otherwise he wouldn't be telling me). now, aa sponsor was a hardcore junky and dealt with lots of drugs back when he was getting high, i know from him, and i don't know, he ran with serious cats so i wouldn't be surprised if there are relations to organized crime, etc. however, i asked the na sponsor to back it up because it's a very fucking serious accusation and a lot of trust is going to be gone if it's true, or not. i haven't shared this with my aa sponsor because i don't know what to do. i already told my aa sponsor my deepest darkest secret on the fourth step because i had questions about it and he didn't even flinch which made me comfortable confiding in him. now i don't know what the fuck to do, i don't want to get high but i don't want to deal with bullshit like this, it's crap that happened when i was active. please, please help with a suggestion. 

i've spoken to two other guys i'm really close to and one says he doesn't believe it because he's known him (aa sponsor) for a few years and said to keep him since it's working. the steps are my last hope because i couldn't stay clean for 90 in 90, talking about it, etc.

either way my trust is fractured regardless if it is true, or isn't. i don't want to get high anymore and i want to make the best choice.

and i've started liking aa more because in my experience it is way more serious about recovery but i don't fucking know. i haven't been so broken since my last use and i want to make a decision before doing the fifth step.",q21,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0

 post: so it's 78 days sober from everything. besides cigarettes.

and in the past week and a half or so it's been so hard to push through the day. i wake up fine and by the evening i'm hurting so hard. part of me knows there is no way i'm fucking this up and part of me says fuck it, it wasn't that bad and it's not like i'm going to get high over it but i am in such mental agony that i almost want to make it stop somehow.

and yeah, a meeting every day. prayer every day. stepwork most days. commitments twice a week and service when asked or needed. giving newcomers hope when possible. doing normal shit. celebrated my 24th birthday sober by going to a meeting and taking a burning desire and then fellowshipping at a diner afterwards. besides my family, outpatient counselor, and a teacher at school, no birthday wishes. i should be grateful i still have family. a real friend would be nice.

and yet i feel hopelessness when i was at the end of my last run. i was watching under the skin (great movie), because now i have some money, and all i could think was my god, i just want to be able to touch a girl's face, neck, hold her hand. and there is no one. nothing today, bleak future. i wonder if i am wasting away my life. if sobriety is even worth it.

and i don't want to let people down by getting high. i know that when the spike is in my arm, i will think first of the people who tried to reach out, their faces flashing in my mind before the rush comes. what if i get arrested again. what if...

so it's great not getting high, but that's about it. i wrote down pros and cons of being active and sobriety and it made it clear sobriety outweighed being active.

i become jealous of what others have. i become jealous of those who smile. those who seem to live perfect lives. when i hear a speaker who is 33 with 17 years of sobriety i don't know whether to be jealous or disgusted. and when i see someone strung out at a meeting i don't know whether to tell them this works, or to ask if i can buy one.

i don't want to talk to my sponsor because, well, if i'm not having fun in sobriety i'm doing something wrong, which seems to be the case.

when will this end, i want the 9th step promise now. god hook me up with something, or let us talk about it.",q0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: shot dope for the last time January 19th of last year if I am not mistaken. have not had a drink or a drug since.

I spent six months in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous, repeatedly using because I was under the impression that I had the power to come back and to not use no matter what. Today my first step is that I always use, no matter what. By the grace of a power that is everything, I happened to meet a recovered heroin addict in NA who still tried to help me when everyone else failed. We went through the 12 steps in about four months, and ever since having had a spiritual awakening as the result of them, the obsession to get fucked up left and has not returned.

I thought I was so hopeless that the last stop on the block couldn't get me better. I could not stay stopped from shooting heroin and ruining my life and the lives of those around me. The only thing I attribute my sobriety to is to constantly working the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, which allow me to be of service, and allow me to stay in the meetings of 12 step fellowships sober.

 post: I used to post/read on here a lot, don't much anymore. Anyway, a lot of posts here are about early recovery/relapse/etc. and I wanted to share that there is hope.

I celebrated 4 years with two friends of a few years in Belgium eating chocolate, fries and waffles and sightseeing. I have been able to do so much since I've gotten sober from IV heroin and everything else. I have traveled to five continents this past year. I have been able to see friends I've made over these past four years and from before. I have been able to go to sporting events, even spending hundreds on a game. I have been in and lost relationships. I have made friends and lost some. I have built such strong connections to people. I have been able to have successes and failures. I have been able to save money, invest and look forward to a future that has infinite possibility. I have been able rebuild relationships with my family. I am sometimes brought to tears from the gratitude for the gift that I have received. I have watched other hopeless addicts become productive members of society who give back. The list keeps on going.

I didn't expect this to happen. Sobriety was supposed to be grim, non-exciting and limited. I remember when I had nearly 90 days, I thought I would have to kill myself to make the obsession to shoot dope go away. I remember when I was writing my fourth step with 3 days sober thinking that this was all for the birds, nothing worked anyway. I remember all the deaths that I experienced of lifelong friends and people I had just met, wondering if it was even possible or worth it. This is an accident, these four years. This wasn't supposed to work, I had resigned myself to the reality that I was going to get high again, and eventually die. Then I was transformed into a different person. The obsession left and has never returned, at least not anything close to what I used to feel: the clammy hands, writhing stomach, and murderous determination to get a fix. Have I felt like getting high? Sure, maybe in passing at some difficulty or failure, but always fleeting. Usually if anything I just get a little blue for a bit and then am forced to talk to someone about it and am lifted up.

I will be real with you. The reality is that most addicts will die from addiction, on this sub or off, sober or not. Your (and my) chances are horrible. Yet there is a chance, and the opportunities that this chance provides are worth it. It is insane what I used to do to myself, I no longer hold any ill will towards anyone who tried to stop me or distanced themselves. I hope this gives you a realistic yet hopeful picture of recovery. The things that worked for me the most were going through the 12 steps of AA quickly, I would recommend DAA/OPA/HA for identification. I hope you find something that works for you and are able to experience the freedom and happiness of a recovered addict.",q0,0,1,"1,3",0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: Back in May of this year, my ex boyfriend died from a heroin overdose. We had broken up in January, and reconnected in April. We met for coffee, where I confessed to him that since our break-up I had started messing around with dope. To my surprise, he confessed the same. Whereas I had been shooting tar from the jump, he told me he had been ordering #4 off the darknet and snorting it. One thing leads to another and he ends up at my house that night, where I supervised his first shot of tar. A few days later, he proposes that we go in 50/50 on a gram of some super potent #4, some of the same that he had been insufflating. Fast-forward...we get the package in the mail on a Friday evening, and spend the next couple of days floating together in dope-fueled bliss. Things were great, they were beautiful, we loved each other as much as ever and now we were sharing a new experience, sharing our pain like we always had. For the 2 years we were together, we did all kinds of drugs. He was the computer-savvy one who would order anything under the sun as long as it offered a good kick, primarily rolly drugs and psychedelics. MXE, MDA, MDMA, 4-ACO-DMT, 25-b, 2c-b, etc... We scraped by the edge of life hand in hand more times than we could count and loved every second of it. Anyway. Saturday night, he goes home alone. I kiss him goodbye, tell him ""please be safe"" and he promises me...""you know me, I'm always safe"". Should have thought twice about that....there are lots of ""should haves"" to look back on. The next morning, he is not answering my calls or texts or Facebook messages. I call his roommate and ask him to go check on him. Roommate knocks, gets no answer, door is locked. He climbs through the window. Finds him in his bed, dead. The last time I had spoken to him was around midnight the night before. He overdosed sometime between then and 10am Sunday morning. 

His mother has since decided that I am the sole reason for his death. She believes I was there the night he died, shot him up, and fled when he overdosed. I always carry narcan on me, if I had been there, he would still be alive. She continues to publicly harass me on social media, putting me on blast all over Facebook, telling his 1,000+ friends that I am a murderer, that I killed her son and have no remorse. After he died, and she asked me what happened, I told her everything. I gave her complete honesty. She knows I was the first to put a needle in his arm. That seems to be the only piece of information she regards. Everything else is dust in the wind.

I feel on the verge of breaking...I know I fucked up, I made a mistake...Why it had to be a fatal one, I will never know. I don't deny anything that I have done. but I know I don't deserve this...we made our choices. I don't blame the one who gave me my first shot for the endless months of the pain of addiction I have put myself through.

not sure what I'm looking for here. maybe someone who has been through something similar. Or just someone to listen. I don't know. It hurts so goddamn bad. I loved him, I loved him a damn lot. I know he loved me too, and would be in such despair to see how things turned out. In the months after his death my use spiraled completely out of control, I went from using a couple of times a week to every day, all day, waking up in the middle of the night sick. Doing a little better now, but there remains a long road ahead. 

thanks for reading.

 post: & he was SO MAD. for a little while, until I could explain to him the severity of the situation. hallelujah for the local needle exchange. 

I could tell something was up immediately after he did the shot. He was standing up but swaying in our bathroom, chin down and eyes half-closed. I got closer and saw that his eyes were bouncing around in his head and the color was quickly draining from his face. I went for the Narcan to get it ready. He saw me prepping it and literally ran away...but moments later he was completely unconscious and unresponsive on our bed, sweating profusely, skin turning from white to grey. I pulled down his jeans and stuck him in the thigh with the IM syringe. A few moments later he was in serious pain. He was still pale and sweating but now crying from the pain of precipitated w/d. I felt terrible for having to subject him to that kind of pain, but I was also furious because he insisted on doing the shot right before we were supposed to walk out the door to get to my morning Subutex dose and IOP group meeting. Ended up missing the meeting and getting a surprise UA when I finally did make it into the clinic. Sigh. Anyhow, just wanted to tell SOMEONE about the heart attack of the day. If you have access to Narcan, jump on that shit. It saved the life of someone I love dearly today. I would not want to be stuck in a similar situation without it. Going to start carrying it on me everywhere I go again. 

Much love to yous guys, be well & happy scheming!",q0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

 post: The night before last, my bf and I were up all night shooting speedballs. I did my last one at about 6am and ptfo'd by 6:30. I woke up at maybe 1pm feeling like complete shit - sweating profusely, fever, somewhat delirious, just all around sickly and extremely uncomfortable. This happened maybe 3 more times until I finally got up at about 7pm, most of the bad feelings having subsided except for general fatigue and a slight temperature. Since then, I've had an on-and-off fever and have been sleeping like crazy - slept from around 5pm to midnight last night, then 3am to 1pm, and another 2-3 hour nap today between the hours of 3pm and 6pm. All day today I've had an awful migraine and an on-and-off slight temperature. I can't be sure if these symptoms are related to the speedball night, but it would seem as if they are. I know it's stupid, but I really, really don't want to go to the ER. I've been once this year for septicemia... they treated me like absolute shit. Their philosophy for detoxing drug/alcohol addicts is ""what goes up must come down"" (genius), which is equal to no comfort meds whatsoever. The last time I was hospitalized they had me cold turkey on top of the septicemia, which was one of the most painful experiences of my life. I woke up on day 2 absolutely DRENCHED in the most foul, rank smelling sweat I have ever produced in my life - it seeped through all my clothes, soaked my bedding, even my hair was dripping with this sickly sweet, syrupy-sticky sweat. I produced a smell that only secretes from the pores of a body that's rotting from the inside out. Anyhow, right now my temperature is sitting at 100 even, I don't have any other symptoms other than a migraine I tamed with ibuprofen a couple of hours ago. What do you guys think? I'm really, really unsure of what to do. I'm thinking in the morning (about 3 hours) I will call the clinic and try to get an appointment (lost my medical access program card, though, and I'm not sure if they will take me w/out it), but I want opinions on if this sounds more urgent than that?

slipped_andfell,opiates,7lnq2e,12/23/2017 4:04,0,0,"title: question about hitting feet .
 post: hey errybody! I been having a bit of a problem lately with hitting... 
For the past 8 months or so I've been hitting my hands and wrists primarily, which CAN get extremely painful and stressful, but 8 times out of 10 only takes 1-3 tries before I register. This had been working just fine for me until the time came for my annual pain in the ass to come around to assault me again - cold. I cannot hit for shit in the cold. I'm a very thin female with very tiny veins, and when it's cold outside those little fuckers shrivel up and retreat, only to be brought to the surface by hot showers or some kind of exercise, which are not always possible. My arms are hard enough to hit in good weather, in the cold they're fucking impossible. 

Out of exasperation, I've taken to shooting up in my feet. There's some great veins down there, big ol ropes that I can usually register with 1 or 2 tries. I am extremely careful not to miss when I'm hitting my feet or ankles, as I have made this mistake before and holy shit did it hurt. Not something I want to go through again. What I'm wondering is: how come, despite my obsessive precautions, do I still get these histamine-reaction-like rashes in the areas of my foot I'm shooting up in? 

I register, untie, re-register, and depress the plunger slowly, registering again halfway through just to be sure I'm still in (even tho I would know right away if I were missing), and despite all this I'm still ending up with that splotchy, red lumpy rash that I get on my hands/arms when I miss a bit up there. This shit hurts WAY worse on my feet than it has ever hurt my hands or wrists, and the pain lingers for days at a time. Not to mention it itches with a fiery, burning wrath and that itch follows my vein halfway up my leg immediately after I hit. My ankles have been swollen for days since hitting there around last Thursday, and I know I didn't miss even a little. 

Does anyone know what might be causing this and is there anything I can do to prevent it? I know obviously I can hit somewhere else, and I'm trying to find some other spots, but if anyone has any advice for me in the meantime I would appreciate it a great deal...cause for now I'm walking with a pretty prominent limp. Feet are always a last resort, first I try my hands/wrists/arms, but lately those just haven't been accessible. It's really upsetting to start every damn day waking up sick, then spending however long repeatedly stabbing myself with a needle, bleeding everywhere, getting frustrated and sometimes crying and occasionally missing and making all the effort and pain for nothing.

Thanks y'all! Apologies if this is a dumb question, if anything I'm mostly curious as to why the rash/pain is happening...my guess is that when I stand back up after hitting, maybe some of the shot leaks out of the hole in my vein and reacts in the same way a miss would...? I dunno. Sorry 4 the wall, I've been banging coke tonight and this post is way longer than it should be. Hope everyone is having a good night. JJ bless u all.",q2,0,0,0,0,"5,2",0,0,0,0,0

slipped_andfell,opiates,aft1cg,1/14/2019 1:32,0,1,"title: Been on methadone for around 8 months now... Basically a review of my experience so far for anyone curious or considering it .
 post: TLDR - sorry for the damn wall o text!!! Basically I had a lot of really negative ideas about it for a long time and wanted to share a positive experience. 
Keep in mind I am still on methadone maintenance and cannot speak for the experience of tapering or getting off completely... This is me mid-treatment. Thanks :)

First of all, I think it's important to mention that I started out being of the very strong and strict opinion of methadone: fuck that, it's just a substitute, it's just government-funded heroin, etc. At the time, I knew only 2 ppl who had gone from heroin to methadone, and both were self-proclaimed ""lifers"" that continued to be swallowed by their addictions to other substances (particularly things that potentiated their methadone, causing their daily  doses to get them fucked the fuck off) despite leaving heroin behind.

My dad was one of them. He went to methadone after 20+ years of heroin use. We talked a lot over FB and I would tell him all about where I was at in life. I didn't need to sugarcoat things for him. He always ended up bringing up methadone, at first suggesting and over time almost trying to push it on me as a solution. I rejected it, so sure of myself that I wasn't as weak as him, that I would be able to find the peace in sobriety that he couldn't and some day be able to cold turkey kick and never look back. I kept trying, going in and out of state-funded detoxes, signing up for the 30 day programs but always bailing by or before my 2nd week. I would make the tiniest improvements, like getting a job, only to blow it all up in my own face and go on a remorse and self-loathing bender & wake up in a worse place than before. 
 
A little over a year ago, my dad's hardcore lifestyle caught up with him in a major way. His liver was failing and due to his status as an addict, he didn't qualify for a replacement. He wouldn't stop drinking no matter how much it hurt him or what the doctors said. He died in a hospital. I hadn't talked to him in months. I went to his memorial still strung out, around a family I hadn't associated with for as long as I could remember. 

After he died, I started to give the idea of methadone a chance. His death came as a surprise, despite how harshly he had lived. Even though we joked about needing to have a visit ""before one of us dies"", it was never a serious concern of mine. I faced the truth, that methadone may be my last resort, but I was down at that level already. The thought of my life flying past me like my father's had for him, ending in loneliness, regret, and pain was terrifying and now very real. I didn't formally decide to do it ""for him"", but my outlook softened at the thought of taking his advice and it saving me from the painful life he lead. 

Anyway, Heroin wasn't getting me high anymore, not any amount, and the meth/coke/crack/Xanax/whatever-the-fuck I did to fill that hole was tearing me up. My relationship, my health, my self-respect, the little respect anyone had for me... my life in general was deteriorating.  The selling point was when an aquaintance told me ""I can wake up in the morning and CHOOSE whether or not I want to use"". To me, that meant I'd be able to get high if I wanted, but the nightmare of withdrawal would no longer be a problem. So I worked for the money to do intake and pay for a weeks worth of doses, called the closest clinic and did the damn thing. I started at 30mgs.

I kept using daily for about a month and a half. I could still feel it on a lower dose. My boyfriend had not made the switch yet and knowing he was using was way too tempting. As I had been told, the daily dosing waved my sickness away and made me hella drowsy for a week or so. My boyfriend did his intake almost exactly a month after I had, after seeing my improvement as he still suffered. By my 3rd month, I was using maybe once a week or 2. This huge change was settling in on me, like a fog. It was like over time, the idea of shooting dope was becoming less and less appealing. So I would brush it off till I got a really bad craving, then I'd cop and the whole thing would be such a disastrous burden. I got a job on my 3rd month and naturally my paychecks were triggering as shit. But every time I'd give in, I ended up so disappointed that I truly never wanted to do it again...not ""fuck this, I'm kicking tomorrow!"", but ""I don't need this anymore, it doesn't help me, I can feel good without it."" The icing on the cake was my total inability to hit a vein anymore...after so long stabbing and bleeding and missing, only to receive the most dull ""rush"" imaginable IF I did succeed...it was horrible. 

As time has passed, my use has continued to diminish in frequency. I've leveled off at 60mgs per day and if I wanted it, I'd need a much bigger shot than I used to to feel even a little. My use went from daily, to weekly, to monthly, to only on the random occasion of a biting craving intertwined with depression or self loathing... For instance, recently I had an extremely traumatic & triggering life event. I bought a 60 of tar, from which I got no rush, but still woke up with my car stopped in the middle of traffic, and still have a huge painful early-stage abcess on my arm (right on top of my favorite tattoo). That experience was so overwhelmingly infuriating, it left me with only regret. I'm lucky as fuck I didn't go to jail. 

What I didn't expect from methadone that I have been so pleasantly surprised by, is the sense of freedom. Within the first week I felt like my cell door had been unlocked. Not having to wake up sick, or spend the first hour(s) of every day making myself hurt and bleed in search of a vein..no being cornered into trusting scary, violent, or creepy ppl, no putting myself the way of the law or danger out of desperation...

Im not as scared anymore, I don't feel the need to take shit from people or bend over backwards to prove to them that I'm worthy of their decency despite what I am. When I was using, I took the worst shit from people who claimed to care about me because I didn't think I was worthy of anything better. I'm so much more confident in my appearance since I've gone up to a normal weight and my body isn't constantly covered in scabs from picking.

Ppl I meet now would never guess all the fucked up places I've been...not that I'm ashamed of it, but it's nice to be able to choose whether or not I'm going to let someone know that part of my story. I'm learning things about myself I never knew and probably never would have known without the entire experience of addiction, and I can almost truthfully say that I don't regret it. One thing I am positive that I don't regret is my choice to try methadone. It hasn't been a miracle cure, and there never will be such a thing. Methadone helped me achieve more than I ever could have hoped it would, and I have no desire to stay on it forever...but I also have no desire to get off of it anytime soon, because I know I'm not ready. And that's fine. Methadone is by no means doing for me what heroin did & I don't want it to. All it's doing it helping me to take my recovery process at the pace I need to. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk :p

 post: ..you are *REALLY* fucking on.

Today was a pretty normal day. I woke up around noon and polished off the rest of the dope that I had bought last night. (My dealer delivered a bundle to my neighborhood.. at 3am lol) 

A friend of a friend had been blowing me up all morning to middleman for him, so I ended up doing that for him. Homeboy didn't follow proper etiquette at all, but what can ya do? He ended up tipping me three bags so it was a worthwhile exchange. 

After I gave Dude his ten bags I pulled around to the closest parking lot and blew em down. I smoked a cig and drove to another parking lot to chill. And holy fuck. Idk what was up with those three bags but I was nodded the fuck out in a WaWa parking lot lmao.

Only reason I'm bothering to share this is b/c I have a prettyy high tolerance; I can usually blow down an entire bundle and function totally normally. But for whatever reason these three bags did the goddamn trick!

Welp thanks for reading ya'll. Stay safe, fuck the police, and happy nods! Yrs truly, SoberFace",q0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

 post: Yesterday I hit up my dgirl and made plans with her to cop first thing in the morning before she had to clock in at work. Her shift started at 6am, and I didn't wanna oversleep, so I just stayed up all night watching YouTube and playing FireRed. I left my house around 5:30 (at the time of writing that's just a little more than two hours ago) and copped about 15 min later. 

In order to leave the house that early w/o making my folks suspicious I told them I was working today, so that means I couldn't go right home after copping. And at six in the morning, I can't exactly hit up someone to chill with. So I did was any Bruce Springsteen loving American kid would do in my situation, I hit the open road. 

Still early enough to avoid which was nice. What's not so nice is that I drove out of range of the radio station that plays my favorite morning radio show. Oh well, first world problems amirite?

I made my way to a tiny ass town in the middle of nowhere, totally surrounded by farm land. I'm pretty high and grubbin on McDonalds breakfast. And all this before 8 am. All in all, a pretty good day so far.

A lot of the time I have to make my move between getting done work and arriving at home, a simple phone call once I sign out for the day and I figure out what the plan is. Not to mention I have a reliable connect who lives in a part of town I am not familiar with. He tells me what street he's on, and rather than ask for directions I can just look it up on my Map application and figure out exactly where it is.

 post: Okay, so before I tell my story I have to mention this weird thing I like to do. It's a pretty wasteful activity so I can only do it if I'm home alone. I'll run my shower but not get in it or anything. I stay totally clothed, I just sit down in the bathroom while the shower is running. I find it comforting. Don't judge. 

Anyways, story time. I copped some FIRE this afternoon. I actually posted a picture of it, these weird brown bags that I had never seen before. At first I was skeptical of them; just by looking at them you couldn't tell how much dope was in the bags, if any at all. My dboy assured me they weren't beat. In fact, I was told to be careful since it was so strong. I've heard that one before. Still, I decided to heed his warning and started off with just one bag. It was pretty good, and the bag had a decent amount in it too. I was happy with my purchase.

After my test bag, I had to swing by an old co-workers house to hook her up with a bag. She's lent me loads of money these past couple weeks, so I figured it was the least I could do. 

I left her place, and instead of going straight home I found a parking lot where I could knock down a few more bags. I think I bumped like three or four. Then I went straight home and posted up on my front porch and sparked up a cig. Even though I didn't even do half of my bundle, I was nodding fairly hard. Hell yea, I'm into it. 

Around the time I finished my cigarette, my old man came outside to tell me he was going to my cousin's daughter's bday party. Which means I've got the house to myself. ""Hell yea"" I think to myself. After he leaves I go into my room and rail four more bags and I'm feeling RIGHT. I'm sure that I'll be nodding hard, so I set an alarm for myself. While I'm high I decide that I'm going to do that thing I do with the running shower.

All I can say is that I'm glad I set an alarm. Because the moment I sat down with that shower going, I nodded off *RIGHT AWAY*. About a half hour later my alarm goes off and I snapped back. I had kind of expected to fade in and out, I wasn't anticipating just going out cold.

I was still high when I woke up, but I guess some combo of sitting in steam for a half hour and the shock of waking up like I did had me extra messed up. Because I was having trouble standing up straight and walking and all that good stuff. I ran downstairs to smoke a cigarette to center myself. After getting halfway thru I realized that my pops would be home soon, and my drug stuff was just sitting out. I was in such an absent-minded rush that I almost ran back inside with my smoke still lit. I was in a purely delirious state for a while before I could pull myself together. 

All I know is I'm so glad I set an alarm. I can't imagine if my dad had come home and I was passed out in the bathroom, with the shower running; clearly no intention of even taking a shower. Welp, lesson learned I suppose.

TL;DR I got super high, then ran my shower to create a sauna like effect. Nodded out and woke up to an alarm a half hour later. Had trouble functioning once I woke up.

 post: I just wanted to give you guys a heads up, I was diagnosed with partial radial nerve palsy in my right wrist from nodding off in a weird spot on my hand. This usually only happens when you are intoxicated, as when the body is sober it will naturally reposition itself during sleep. However, I was nodding off in a weird ass position and the next morning i couldnt flex and could barely move my right hand. I also have this thing called “wrist drop,” which means i cannot extend my wrist because of the radial nerve palsy. The doc said itll take 4-6 weeks to heal and for me to regain mobility in that hand. Just wanted to let you guys know, as I did not think one night of sleeping weirdly would cause such a big problem with a long healing time. Im out of work as well since i cannot write at all because i cant grip anything. When nodding off, make sure you arent in a weird position!

 post: I posted a couple days ago about how I was trying to get clean for the first time. Thank you to everyone who responded. This has basically been my only source of support. I was doing pretty well. I mean, I felt awful and I was struggling, but I wasn't taking.

Unfortunately, a couple days ago I was hanging out with a friend that I also buy from. He asked when I was going to buy again. I told him I probably wasn't because I'm trying to get clean. He gushed about how proud and how happy for me he was. He then proceeded to offer to spot me some for free ""just in case I need them."" I told him no. Sadly, when I got home later that night, I found what he had offered in my purse. I guess he must have slipped them in when I wasn't paying attention. I couldn't bring myself to get rid of them. I don't know why not. I just..couldn't.

I made it through the night and the next day. But then I just broke and got high again. I made it a week. I'm trying really hard to not let this completely derail all my progress (however slight and small it may have been. I know a week isn't very long) I thought I was through the hardest parts of physical withdrawals and such. Can anyone tell me if it will just reset or if they'll be less severe this time around?

But in the end, I came out of it with a whole list of numbers of people to lean on for help and support.

The issue I've been dealing with today is almost silly in a way. It's something that I'm stressing out about a lot. I'm having my wisdom teeth removed in a few weeks. It isn't for another 3 weeks. But I'm terrified. I don't know what I'm going to do. I know I'll be given a prescription of, most likely, hydros. Those are what I first got hooked on. I know I'll need them to begin with. But majority of patients don't need the whole prescription. I'm scared of how I'll react to it.

 post: I don't really even know how to explain the head space I'm in. It's 2:30 am of day 25 clean. I'm so damn close to 30 days. In the beginning I was super motivated to change and finally get clean. It took me a few months since making the decision to get clean to get this much consecutive clean time. The first little while I went to as many NA meetings I could get to. I called people whenever I was struggling. I cut ties with all my friends who use. Which is basically all of them. I had all the motivation in the world to be clean and I worked really, really hard to get there.

 But lately.. things have been weird. I haven't really had too many strong cravings or whatever. But I just don't feel the motivation to keep working at being clean. Like.. I want to go to parties. I want to hang out with my friends. I want to DO something. I feel like all I do is just sit around now because I lost all my friendships. I'm so fucking bored. I just kind of feel like, fuck it. Why not just go back to how it was? I don't know what to do. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

 post: It's been a little while since I've posted here. I thought I was doing well and had everything under control. And I guess I'm not doing badly. Things are just getting harder and I'm getting really frustrated.

I have 35 days clean. 35 long, hard days. I was feeling so great when I finally hit 30 days though. I really thought I was going to be able to make it through this and stay clean for good this time. But lately I feel like I'm losing all the support I had, which wasn't much to start off with. 

My sister has been reasonably good at supporting me through this. But when I told her I'd reached my 30 day mark, she got angry and yelled at me, saying that she didn't give a shit and if I was actually trying to get clean I wouldn't bother counting my clean time. She told me she didn't want to hear any of my shit and that I could fuck off and stop dragging her down with me.

I have a friend who just had a surgery. She's been pretty good at supporting me. She asked me if I knew anyone who would want to buy the left over of her prescription and if I'd help her sell it. Which isn't a terrible thing to do, I guess. It just is so frustrating to me. I'm trying so hard to leave that life behind and move on. But it feels like everyone is against me. I lost almost all of my friends when I decided  to get clean. And now I feel like the few who stayed are turning against me as well. I just don't know what to do or how to approach this situation alone and deal with the lack of support. Any thoughts or advice?

 post: I apologize in advance for the length of this post. But I need help. I've been sporadically posting here for the past few months, in a different mindset each time. But things have gone downhill pretty fast the past little while. A few weeks ago I relapsed after only a little over a month clean. I went 9 days straight fucked up basically all day. Then got upset with myself, went to another NA meeting, and made it 2 days before I made a phone call and landed myself a free script of oxys. It's now 3am the morning of day 2.

I don't know what's been going on with me, what happened that derailed it all. I guess.. I just wasn't ready for the fact that, even though my life was changing completely and turning upside down, the rest of world was just going to keep going. It seems like every where I turn there's another trigger. I'm stressing hard core right now. I have finals coming up. I'm trying to go through the process of a getting a restraining order taken out. 

I don't talk about this very often. It's really personal and I struggle with it. But I feel like it is the main thing impeding my recovery and I need help. When I was 15 I dated a guy who was 18 at the time. He had serious anger issues and a tendency to get aggressive. More often than not I was on the receiving end of the aggression. It went on for about 6 months, came to a head when he decided it didn't matter that I was telling him no and that I was't ready to have sex for the first time. I stayed with him about another month after that. Two years later, another girl pressed charges. I ended up testifying against him. He got out of jail about a month ago and has been making my life a living hell since then. My anxiety has SKYROCKETED since he's been out.

I know everyone has issues. And I know that my struggles sure aren't the worst ones out there. I just don't know how to deal with it without getting stoned. Does anyone have any advice on dealing with life's bullshit as it hits you without falling back into drugs? Sorry for the rant. Thanks for reading.

Sorry for the long post.

 post: First of all, I'm just going to apologize for being THAT obnoxious person who keeps coming back and forth. I'm trying. I've just struggling right now. And I'm sorry if it's a bit of a read.. I just need some where to tell what's been going on and hopefully get my head on straight.

I picked up my 30 days the beginning of November. And then lost it not too long after. Things have been rough the past month or so. Some things because of my own actions, and some that are out of my control. The main thing that's been messing with my head is that my ex boyfriend who I helped send to jail for physical and sexual assault got out of jail about 2 months ago and has been doing things that are just flat out not okay and giving me shit basically since he got out. I'm trying to figure out what I can and should do legally and trying to deal with what's he's doing. It's messing with my head and bringing up some hard memories. My anxiety flares up really badly whenever he's involved. I know that's not an excuse to use, it's just a major trigger I'm trying to work through.

I just started a new job. It's a actually a really good place for me to be. I've seen quite a few people there I recognize from NA so I know it's definitely a better environment than where I was before. But new jobs are always stressful in the beginning. I struggle with pretty heavy seasonal depression that I can feel starting to hit. I have finals coming up I'm nowhere near prepared for (ah the joys of being a drug addict in college. responsibility goes out the window). I started smoking again. Which I know isn't the worst thing in the world. But I thought it was something I'd actually succeeded at quitting. Guess not. 

I have a dealer I used to buy from giving me crazy amounts of shit right now, trying to get me to buy or inviting me over to come shoot up with them and freaking out at me when I say no thanks. I don't want to be rude to him. I keep telling him no thanks and that I'm trying not to do that anymore. But he won't leave me alone. From Facebook messages to texts and calls to texting and calling people he knows I hang out with. I don't know why he's so set on breaking me, but I can't get him to leave me alone. I don't know how to tell him to fuck off without being a total bitch.

I don't know. I don't really know why I've been fucking up so badly lately. But I can't seem to get more than a few days clean. This is the beginning of day 4. It's longest I've gone since getting 30 days. I know something has to change. I just feel so overwhelmed and like I can't keep it together. I don't know. I'm failing and fucking up hard. I just need some help and support. I've been stubborn and stupid. I know that. I just don't know how to handle everything that's going on right now.

Thanks to anyone who stayed with me through that rant and to everyone here for being so great and supportive. Much love to everyone out there. Keep doing the good things you're doing.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

 post: I know this isn't the typical type of post but is anyone else up? I'm struggling really hard right now. This is the beginning of my day 7 after about a 3 week relapse. I have a final in less than 8 hours. I can't sleep for the life of me. It's killing me. I can't focus. I've been trying to study but my head just seems like it's stuck in a fog. Anyone else get that in early recovery? I'm almost certain I'm going to fail this final. I'm dreading having to go sit it. I can't make that voice telling me that I know EXACTLY what would help me sleep and make me stop stressing for a little while shut up. I'm trying so hard to not make that phone call. I don't know what to do.

I've met some amazing people here who've given some amazing insight, especially the past few days. I've been trying to take another look at my life and my recovery and really see what needs to be done and what needs to change to be successful this time around. I'm realizing that I have some things in my life that need to be dealt with. It just seems.. so overwhelming. It feels like every tough or painful emotion has been amplified by 100. I guess that's kind of to be expected and a no duh. Take away the numb of drugs and what does that leave you right? I'm having a really hard time dealing with some of these emotions and feelings. It just seems like it's all too much and too heavy all at once. I feel like I can't handle it all on my own. I hate that. I hate feeling this.. weak I guess.

swimmurmaid,OpiatesRecovery,1vuf71,1/22/2014 6:46,0,1,"title: Opening Up (Sorry for length) .
 post: First of all, I'm sorry if this gets lengthy and makes no sense. I just need to empty my head. I don't mean for this to be a pity-me post in any way at all. There are just some things that I'm realizing I need to open up about and be honest about if I'm EVER going to succeed at getting clean. I'm so scared and I don't know if I'm ready to tell the people in my life the things I need to. This sub has been  a saving grace for me. So even if no one reads this, I need to get it out.

I'm 18 years old. I'm a freshman in college. Dream job, lobbyist. There's no way I'll ever get anywhere near there as a drug addict. I can't even tell anyone that that's what I want with my life. They all just laugh and say yeah right, be serious. That makes me so sad. I was about 15 when I had my first taste of opiates. It wasn't anything dramatic. My boyfriend, who was 18 at the time, just handed me a few pills and told me to take them. I'd been drunk and smoked before. But this.. was different. It was really an issue for a while. Every now and then, he'd hand me something, I'd take them without question. And then things..changed. He changed. I couldn't do anything right. He was always angry. I never knew why. I'd never had a boyfriend before, I was young. One day, I guess he just kinda snapped. I remember so clearly the first time he hit me. Looking back I just want to scream at myself to get the fuck away from him from that first time. But I just didn't know what to do. I left, started walking home. He pulled up next to me and apologized. I didn't know what to do. So I just got in his truck and went back to his house with him. That was the first night I felt like I needed the little white pills he gave me to numb out what was going on in my head. It got worse. And worse. I was spending more time getting ready in the mornings covering bruises than anything else. He was giving me pills more and more frequently. I was getting addicted without really even realizing it. When he'd get mad or have a bad day or something and come at me, I'd be telling myself that it would be okay and I get handle it because he'd give me something later. It was just getting so out of control. It all kind of blew up when he decided it was time for me to lose my virginity whether I wanted to or not. He was bigger than me so it didn't matter to him that I said no, that I was BEGGING him to stop. I finally got the guts to break up with him about a month after the first time. It's been three years today since the first time he took that from me. The past three years have been hell. I tried so hard to just pretend it didn't happen. But I could only keep it out of my head for so long. My use went up drastically. Things would flare every now and then with him. He'd leave me alone for a while. Then he'd start trying to get in touch with me, telling me he missed me. Or threatening me if I ever tried to tell anyone. The past 4 or 5 months (coincidentally about the same amount of time I've been trying to get clean) have been really bad. I think there's another girl getting ready to press charges. He's been pushing me a lot harder. I do the best I can to ignore him and stay away from him. But it's to the point that I leave the gym and he's waiting by my car. Or he's parked outside my apartment complex. I know it isn't excuse. But every time something happens with him, whether he's just talking shit or hitting me around or just..showing up somewhere. I break and call my dealer. I know people have way worse situations or have been through worse and handled it much better I do. And I know I can't blame my use on him. But I'm realizing, I feel like I CANNOT stay clean with him even vaguely a part of my life. I don't know how to deal with what he did to. I still have nightmares about it all time.  I still struggle with day to day life because of it sometimes. I don't quite know how to fix what he broke inside of my head. But I'm realizing drugs aren't doing it. When I come down, the mess is still there. I'm trying to get something done. It's taken me three fucking years, but I've finally got the balls to do something. I think. I started the process of getting a restraining order. I thought about pressing charges. But I'm so so scared. I haven't told anyone in my life that I'm doing anything at all. I'm terrified of what he's going to do to me because I spoke up. Part of me just wants to drop everything all together because I don't know if I'm strong enough to deal with the drama that's going to open up. I just..... don't know what to do anymore. 

It breaks my heart that I know he's done this to other girls. I feel so, so guilty for that. It's my fault. If I'd said something 3 years ago, maybe I could have saved them the same pain. I hate myself for the part I played in their heartache. Because I know exactly how awful it is and how much it fucks with every. single. part. of your life. I know what it did to mine. I'm angry and hurt and sad and confused and bitter and guilty and mad at myself and just...everything else. I don't even know how to explain it. I just feel so stuck on it. Like no matter what I do, I can't get it out of my head. I miss feeling safe. I don't get that every anymore.


Sorry again that this was a novel. If anyone actually read through it all. haha. I just... I know I'm never going to get and stay clean unless I figure this shit out first. I know there are a lot things that play into my drug use. But this is my biggest trigger and struggle. I don't know how, but I have to figure this out. And I will never be able to do that if I don't open my mouth and speak up about it. Thank you for giving me a place to open up and trying to figure shit out. You're all awesome.

 post: I need to check in. I'm really having a hard time loving recovery. I read all of your posts and comments here and you all seem so positive and have all these great things to say about being clean. But for some reason... I just can't seem to find that for me yet. I'm on day 11 clean after off and on use for about 5 months after starting to try to get myself to quit. I don't have any major physical w/ds or anything like that. But damn. I just really fucking hate this. I know that attitude is probably why I keep fucking up and using again. But I just am really, really struggling to find the good in this. I lost the majority of my friends when I first started trying to quit. I could probably reconnect with most of them. But I KNOW if I hang out with them I'll be using. Whether or not they offer it, with where I'm at mentally if I put myself in that situation I'll ask around if anyone has anything. There is no way I'll stay clean if I'm with them. But I'm just so damn lonely and bored. All I do is work. Which isn't bad because I need the money. Badly. But I just go to work and get bitched at all day. It would be super awesome to be able to go relax with friends after. Logically, I know that it wasn't, but it just seems like life was so much better when I was using and not giving a fuck. Things are kind of shitty right now. I'm trying to deal with an asshole who won't leave me alone and figure out what to do there. My grandma (well she isn't technically my grandma. I didn't know any of my grandparents died before I was born. For all intents and purposes, she's my grandma) had a stroke and is in the hospital. I'm just overwhelmed and worn out and stressed and.. I don't even know what. I feel like I'd kill to go get high right now. It's not like it would be hard to make a call and get something... but I'm trying not to. Sorry.

I've been trying to figure out why I'm having such a hard time. It got me thinking to why I'm trying to get clean. I mean... I can think of all the cliche reasons. I have more money now. I'm not AS sick all the time.. But.. I don't know. When I really think about it and I'm actually honest with myself.. I didn't decide to try because I wanted to. It was for a boy. (Laaaaaame I know) He's my best friend in the world. And yes because I'm a stupid girl, I've fallen for him pretty damn hard. When he found out I was an addict, he basically told me if I was using he wasn't going to be in my life. He means the world to me. So I decided to give it a shot. He's been great. He let me come stay with him while I detoxed. He was such a sweetie. He's had my back with some dealers. He's honestly been THE ONLY person in my life who's been support of me. But.... things are changing between us a little bit. He's still my best friend, but there's been a shift. He's going to court on Tuesday. I'm so, so scared he'll get convicted and I'll lose him. God I don't know what I'll do. When I think about it.. I don't know if I'm doing this for me. Or if I'm doing it for him. I don't know if I'll be strong enough to do it for myself without him yet.

 post: I lost all of my friends when I started doing heroin. And then got new friends that also did that sort of thing.

I've tried the whole be friends with them just do different things. Turns out I'm capable of that for about a week, 2 tops, before I'm using again. I'm really, really struggling to make new friends. I will openly admit that I'm weird as fuck. Which is fine. I fully embrace it. Couple that with ridiculously shyness though... Meeting new people isn't my strong point.

I'm telling myself that it's way better to be 19 with zero social life spending weekends by myself at home than being a drug addict. But damn. It would be super nice to say yes to some plans every once in a while.

 post: I haven't posted here in ages. And honestly, I've been doing great lately. Until this past weekend. It's not like anything major even happened. Just stupid shit that's getting me down. I got in a huge fight with the kid who's one of my best friends. He's the reason I even managed to get clean. I don't really even understand why the fight happened. He got really pissed off one night and started punching shit and freaking out. I've seen him like that before. I've seen him dent a car punching and seen him with broken hands and shit after getting in fights. But this night was bad. After he apologized and said I probably didn't want to be around him anymore. So I was honest and told him that when he gets like that it makes me nervous because, even though I know he wouldn't hit me, anytime I've been around a guy like that I always end up taking a punch and it scares me to be around that. He knows I have a history of a seriously abusive relationship, so I thought he would understand. But when I told him that he called me a bitch, told me to fuck off and never talk to him again. I tried to talk to him about it and explain but he just told me that I labeled him as a woman beater and told me to fuck off. We work together and he lives in the apartment next to me so there's no way I can NOT see him everyday. We hung out every fucking day. He really is the reason I've been able to stay clean. He's been my everything the past few months. I know it's a stupid thing to let fuck me up but ever since it happened I've been freaking out and all I want to do is get loaded.

thatsweetembrace,opiates,tvcan,5/19/2012 19:57,0,4,"title: Buying H in NYC for the First Time, a Retrospective [long as fuck] .
 post: I was ordering the dried pods of the poppy flower and dosing myself with the narcotic opiate tea made from these pods a couple of times every month -- in the last years of high school -- then college -- then the years following school when I was directionless and sad, bouncing from one city to another in search of something I could not name.  My Paypal history with my preferred pod vendor is the most accurate record of everywhere I've lived -- old apartments and zip codes -- cities and towns I've passed through quickly and forgotten.  I've tried almost every opiate under the sun, and   have never been physically addicted or gotten into trouble because of them.

Anyhow, if you are into pods, you know what happened to them.  My last order of pods, a couple of months ago, ran me $140 and got me high twice.  Fuck that.  I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.  

So, I decided to finally bite the bullet and take a trip to NYC to buy heroin.  I bought a bus ticket online, and made arrangements to stay with a friend for a few days.  The ride is a couple of hours from where I live.  I wrote down the address of a needle exchange, thinking that maybe if I hung around there I could strike up a conversation with someone who could help me find heroin.  However, I had  reservations about trying to obtain heroin at a needle exchange, as I find it distasteful and kind of rude.  On the bus ride over, it was overcast, drizzly.  On the bus, I reflected on the “how to score dope” posts that I've read that offer advice of varying quality on how to buy drugs on the street as safely as possible while I looked out at the signs of gas stations and McDonald's and Wendy's passing by outside.

I know heroin exists where I live, but my timidity when it comes to asking the “right people”, my clean-cut appearance, and my general lack of street skills have rendered finding it locally, so far, impossible.  On the bus ride over, I grew determined to find heroin while I'm in the city.

When I got off the bus, it was still early afternoon.  My friend was working until later, so I decided to walk around Manhattan and see if any opportunities would present themselves.  The first person I came upon was begging for change at a street-light.  When the light went red, she'd walk up the line of cars, soliciting change with a plastic McDonald's cup in hand.  She'd walk the line of cars front to back, stopping to pick at her teeth for a minute in the mirror of a parked white van while she waited for the light to turn red again so she could repeat her walk.  She was white, in her late-twenties or early thirties, and had the recognizable unwashed appearance of a homeless person or stereotypical street addict.  She had sores on her face that I found unappealing.  I dropped a crumpled dollar in her cup and asked her, nervously, if she knew “where the dope spot was at.”

She said that she didn't do that stuff anymore, that she's in a methadone program now.  She seemed suspicious. Methadone is a subject I'm interested in, and we got to talking.  We discussed the length of the methadone detox, the rules of the program, the process of tapering off.  I asked her about the quality of the local powder heroin as compared to West Coast Tar.  I put another dollar in her cup and reminded her that I'm just looking for twenty dollars of “dope,” and am not trying to pull any funny business or anything, and I'll give her an extra twenty dollars for her trouble.  I feel a pang of guilt, thinking that if she really is on the methadone program and trying to stay clean, twenty dollars in cash might be a huge temptation for her.  She looked and me seriously now and said: “You'll really give me twenty?  People out here usually hardly give me anything.”  I could tell that, even with her suspicions, when she heard that I'd give her twenty bucks, it was too much to resist.

I pulled my pocket open so she could see I had two twenties in tow.  Her posture changed.  She bent forward, a rocket ready to fire into space.  “Alright.  Let's go.”  I was tagging along beside her, trying to keep up.  We jay-walked.  We jay-walked again.  A car honked.  A hot-dog vendor yelled.  My heart was pounding at the prospect that I might have actually started the chain of events that would lead to having heroin in my pocket.  She checked every machine we passed by with a change-slot:  pay-phones, electric parking meters.  In the payphone, she picked up the receiver, and began to dial.  She paused.  “You know what? I have two bags on me.  Just give me the twenty for the two I have, is that cool?  Will you still give me the extra twenty?”  And, of course, I said yes.

She passed me a clear plastic bag.  It was about the size of a baseball card.  Inside were two folded up wax-paper bags stamped in bold purple: “Purple Label.”  Even heroin, it seems, has a brand name.  The bags were about the size of postage stamps.  I quickly stuffed it in my pocket, my greedy left hand feeling for the bags inside.  She cracked a warped smile and yelled “Enjoy!” like a T.V. grandmother might say after setting down a plate of piping hot oatmeal cookies. She said “I'm always around here, if you want to come by tomorrow.”  I walk away, quickly, a shit-eating grin plastered on my face, giddy, light-headed, happy.

I snorted nine bags of heroin in the city.  All of them in bathrooms.  Bathrooms in bars, restaurants, and cafés.  I presented a clean-cut appearance and almost always patronized the business whose bathrooms I used to avoid suspicion.  I carried a cup emblazoned with the place's logo, just to further justify my use of their restroom.

The next time we meet, Tracie asked me if I booted. I said yes, and she offered me a “clean spike.”  I remembered what “boot” means, and told her, actually, no, I don't boot, I snort it.  I tell her that I know it's kind of a waste, but I don't like fucking with needles, even though I know I'm missing out on the “rush” that come with injecting heroin.  A tall black guy walks past us with ear-buds in.  She discreetly pointed at him and whispered “he raped me”.  “He knew I had two warrants out and so I couldn't call the cops.”  “That's fucked up” was all I could think to say.  “My program, if they see me doing any deals or anything, I'm totally fucked.”  She threw the two tiny wax paper bags, into a baseball cap that has suddenly materialized in her hands.  

In the bathroom, I would unzip my backpack and take out a literary journal I purchased before leaving, not realizing that I would be too high to read any of it.  On it, I put a straw cut to about three inches, a folded wax paper bag filled with heroin, and a credit card.  I would empty the tan powder from the wax paper bag, and then rip the bag, getting every little bit of heroin that might have accidentally gotten stuck to the bag.  I would rip the bag a couple of times, crumple it into a ball, and toss it out.  I would take the straw and scrape off any heroin that might have inadvertently gotten stuck on the credit card during while I made the line, putting it back into the line.  I would snort the line.  I would snort the back of the literary journal, just to make sure I got everything.  I would lick my finger and rub it on the back of the journal.  If I saw more than a little bit of powder, I would feel sad for wasting good heroin. I would taste my finger.  It always tasted great.

Before I came to New York, I had scoured the internet in search of Fun Parties and Events and anything that might be interesting.  A Food-Lovers Group was organizing a “guacamole tour” – there were shows and concerts.  I never did anything on the list, my afternoons and evenings all surrendered to a series of heavenly nods.  

The third and final time I saw Tracie, her girl wasn't picking up her phone.  We walked around to kill time, calling often and getting antsy.  We went to a Starbucks, and she ordered one of those giant chocolate and caramel coffee type deals (a milkshake masquerading as a coffee).  She took off the plastic top and stirred it around with her green straw, blending the caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and frozen coffee stuff together into a sloppy mess.  As she did this, I saw how dirty her nails were and felt like cleaning out the gunk under them for her. I think how if people saw her they might be afraid to touch her because she looks homeless and has sores on her face.

On the street, we ran into one of her friends, a handsome boyish looking middle-eastern kid about my age.  He had a Sbarro bag with him, and an open collared shirt exposing abs.  His eyes looked nervous.  He talked about the warrants out for him. He walked like a maniac: long, unpredictable steps.  He said that he could cop for me, but I will have to buy him a bag.  I said OK.  When he’s gone,  I explain to Tracie how I trust her, but now that there are other people involved, I am worried about losing my money.  She said that she trusts this guy like a brother, and that I should not worry.  He loops around a corner.  We follow him, but not too close.   He comes back.  He gave me five unstamped bags, tucked between his thumb and index finger.  He walks away immediately.  I put them in my pocket.  We dart off.  “You owe me two” Tracie said.  I tell her I know.  I counted the five bags and put two in Tracie's outstretched hands.  

We were both pretty happy at this point.  She could tell that I was relieved that it went fine.  She suggested that I come with her to use the men's restroom at the hospital, while she uses the women's.  I declined.  She asked “Am I going to see you again? I figured you got three this time, you know, two for today, one for tomorrow.”   I said probably not, as my bus is scheduled to leave tomorrow.   She gave me a hug, and a little nervous peck on the cheek like a prude school-girl might.  She said “enjoy” and “take care of myself” and I walked away.

As far as the videos go, I find the cartel murder videos rather boring, and uninteresting even from a psychological standpoint.  The visual shock isn't there thanks to being desensitized by the internet at a young age, and my interest in the medical field/human body resulting in viewing such things objectively.  Probably why I think gore porn flicks like SAW are lame and boring as hell.  It would suck to be those being murdered, but I doubt they are innocent civilians.  If you work for the cartel and snitch, or cross them, then what do you expect to happen? to just get fired? lol.  They know the consequences of their actions when in that underworld, just As with people who choose to participate in war (not those caught in the midst of war) know what can happen. Ignorant, beastly Humans are brutal and violent to each other as a way of creating fear, and showing power and control.a   

However, something like the rape of nanking, or internet videos of people killing/maiming random innocent people solicit more empathy and frustration from me.  Although it's, again, nothing new, I still find myself angry when I see or hear about women, children, and innocent people being gruesomely attacked/tortured. An example is those two idiot eastern european kids (Ukranian maybe?) who went around murdering and mutilating random innocent people and then taking cell phone videos of it, only to then go and pawn those cell phones with the snuff videos still on em. Of course, they got caught. Now that shit is fucked up/fascinating psychologically. They were the sons of some upper class rich folks I believe.

 post: So, the other night I shot 50mg of some damn good ecp after testing a 30mg shot. I though this would be ok because the 30mg shot had me feeling good but not nodding. I waited an hour and half to do the second shot. 

Once I pushed the plunger down, I knew I had done too much. That was the highest I've ever been from opiates and I've had a lot of experience just not with iv. I started doing jumping jacks to get my heart rate pumpin and after a few minutes the rush subsided and I was able to sit down and relax.

Every move I made for the next 5 hours or so made me vomit, I couldn't even turn my head without having the urge to puke. Was this an od? I didn't black out but I obviously had too much, so much that I've decided I'm no longer going to indulge in opiates or else I just might kill myself.

There were moments where I was having full conversations and would realize after a minute or two that I was talking to myself lol.

Tl;dr Think I overdosed, decided to quit using before I kill myself.",q3,0,4,0,0,1,"19,0",0,0,0,0

 post: I was on my way to pick up a friend so he could take some stuff into the pawn shop for me. As I was pulling up in front of his house, he comes out of a house down the street screaming at the top of his lungs for me and my other buddy to run down there.

As I walk into this house, I see a beautiful mid twenty year old woman on the floor, my friend over the top of her trying to wake her up. Her hands and lips were purple, eyes rolling around aimlessly. I immediately run to the bathroom and turn on a cold bath. I tell my friend that we need to carry her in there to try and shock her out of this.

We drag her into the bathroom. We start spalshing the water on her face and pumping her chest. She's coming in and out of consciousness now. My friend starts giving her cpr, she starts taking in huge gasps of air and grabs my arm extremely tight, I'm ecstatic to know that she still has some fight in her.

After a few more minutes of cpr and splashing cold water on her face and chest, she comes to and sits up on her own. Come to find out, she only insufflated a $10 pack, I've never seen somebody drop like this and didn't think it could happen that easily without using iv administration.

Me and my friends think this is a result of fent laced dope. She was only out for a good 20 minutes. I felt good about what we did but I feel we really should have called 911. I didn't have a phone, my buddy did but he swore up and down that he knew she wasn't dying and that we could take care of her on our own.

This was my first time ever seeing somebody like this and I honestly thought I'd never have to..",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

I flipped him on his side first,  realized he wasn't breathing, put him on his back and started trying to get him going...I realized I was way over my head and that I didn't have narcan (waiting on a care package). I called the ambulance.

Was worried that I did the wrong thing, but when they gave him narcan the paramedic said he would have likely died without them coming to stabilize him. I feel pretty okay about about my choices tonight, and my friend didn't get in trouble. Is there a reason they didn't get the cops involved?

 post: EDIT: Username was /u/TheBitcoinLeprechaun 

I'm just now learning that he passed away in July. He was one of my best friends. He lived with me to ""get clean"" before moving back to Indiana with his parents...then he went back and kept meeting up with people on here, possibly under a different username (I remember him telling me he made another account). He would call me about four times a week to talk about his life; half the time it was something about wanting to do right by his family and stay clean--the rest of the time it was about how he'd have no trouble chipping and wanted to get high.

The last time I talked to him he called me at midnight to say he'd fought with his parents and was thinking he'd move out. He told me he was planning on copping and he'd call me afterward...I told him to be careful and he'd told me not to worry. I never heard from him again.

His parents found him in his room on July 19th, unconscious. He was in a coma for a week before they pulled the plug. His parents just now went into his accounts, found my info from his LinkedIn and sent me a message...

My gut had already told me something happened. I can't believe I'm just now finding out, but I guess I sort of knew already. I told myself he was in rehab, or even jail... but I knew. I just had no real way of finding out, save searching his obituary once a week (for some reason it never came up).

 post: I'm not sure who's still around from when I was active on this sub--a *lot* of us are dead or in jail--but I wanted to pop in and say hello.

I got clean one year and two months ago. I was laying on a mattress in my living room, just staring at the wall and fucking hating myself. I did a massive line of dope and realized that self-loathing never went away...it was just was hiding under an opiate haze. I had an absolute moment of clarity and realized that I was going to die if I kept going--I checked myself into rehab the next day and never looked back.

My only real point is this: Being clean actually stops fucking sucking. It was really hard for the first few months...if for no other reason than having to re-remember how to be person and talk to people about things that weren't horror stories and really fucked up drug jokes. Having feelings again was super awkward; I honestly stumbled through a period of time where I felt like a robot learning to act human. I met some great people and some terrible ones. *But* my brain settled down and it didn't feel so weird anymore. I don't think about wanting heroin at all. I have a great job, an apartment, a boyfriend and I can actually afford nice things when I want them.

I'm not here to brag, or to tell you you should get clean--do your drugs if that's what you want to do--but if you want to quit and feel like you can't, I'm here to tell you that it's totally possible. It's a new year, people are making some bullshit resolutions...but it wouldn't be the worst to follow through with getting off your DOC this year, if you feel like it's eating away at you.

And if you're going to keep getting high, FFS get some Narcan and be smart about it. I've lost *so* many good people over the past few years and this subreddit has lost even more. Nod as safely as you can and stay on this Earth longer.

Turns out this suburb connect has even better dope than I was getting in the city, go figure. That first shot was fucking amazing!

 post: What's good fuckers?! Hope everyone is having a good night. Let me first start by saying happy new year to each and every single one of you!!!

So who spent the night alone/stayed home tonight?

This guy did. 
I copped 30 bags of some fire dope and a gram of some fishscale from my new plug in the suburbs. Holy shit this batch is fucking amazing. When this dude tells me to be careful I know it's about to be fire :) I still can't believe I'm getting even better dope in the burbs. Now my plug is a straight OG 4cornerhustler, he's like 45 haha. Dude is the definition of a  trap star. For real. The friend that introduced me to him said he has been constantly consistent for the last two years he's been going there. He never gotten subpar or even average quality dope, it's always the straight fire! My dope from my connects in the city was fire too but this shit is off the fucking chain (and only 15mins away vs the two hour round trip to the west side).

Ah, New Years is pretty depressing for me. Tonight should have been the three year anniversary with the love of my life. Unfortunately she couldn't put up with me doing dope anymore and left me 6months ago. She was it man. That was the chick I wanted to marry. We had a good life together, we had an apartment and we were in love. I still think about her every single day. I see her face in everything I do and everytime I close my eyes. Haha I'm gonna stop talking about her here...sorry just needed to get that off my chest. It's all I've been thinking about today and I don't really talk to anyone about it.

The reason why I'm home tonight is just so I can spend some time with my family before I leave for rehab on Thursday. I'm flying out to west palm beach for anywhere for 1-3 months in inpatient. I'm really looking forward to it! This will be my third inpatient rehab this year. It sucks because I know I have all the tools and know how to stay sober. I had a good amount of clean time but I just had a brief slip and got caught so my mom so we decided this is for the best. 

Oh, another reason why I'm home is because I was supposed to go to see flosstradamus in Chicago tonight. So the event sold out a few days ago, go on Craigslist to see how much they are going for...$150 which is 3x of the face value (and the ticket was an Xmas present). Then the junkie in me took over. I put mine up on CL and sold it last night so I could get more dope and some fishscale to go with it. 

Overall, it's been a good night even with the depression. It's safe to say I've been high as fuck all day today.

 post: What's good bropes?! Tomorrow I'm flying out to Florida from Chicago to do a 1-3 month inpatient program. This week my mom found a bunch of rigs (thankfully she didn't find my stash) and we decided I should go to inpatient again. I know I really don't post here much but I've been lurking here for the greater part of last year. 

This week I've shot somewhere around ~100 bags and a little bit of coke since last Friday. I really just started banging it last week. I'm on vivatrol and it was about 23 days since my last shot that day. I figured snorting it wouldn't really break thru so I turned to shooting up. I actually registered first try, go figure. I could see the needle fixation growing FAST holy shit. There's nothing better than seeing that crimson rush of goodness shoot into the rig...it's fucking beautiful. 

Now this is probably unlikely but has anyone here/ know anyone that's been to New Day rehab in north palm beach, fl? 

anyway, tonight will probably be my last time on this sub. Last time i relapsed i actually came in here and before and just started friending...and we all know what happens after that. I really want to kick this addiction. I've really fucked my life up these past two years with the dope and id really like to put shit behind me. It's been great guys. I know I don't know that many of you in here but just know I love all of you guys. Nobody understand this battle with opiates than anyone in here.

 post: What's up bropiates in recovery?! Today I have 78 days. My longest clean time from heroin...ever!!! I wrote a post in the opiates sub at the beginning of January explaining my situation/ deciding to go to rehab in south Florida. I was so happy with all the positive feedback I got, the support meant everything to me then and still does now. 
I wound up doing 21 days in inpatient then getting kicked out for fucking a stripper while inside lol but that's a long story (coed treatment is big down here). Since then I've decided to stay in Florida. now I'm living about a five minute walk from the beach and from my new place of work. I can honestly say I've never been so happy in my entire life. Everything is falling into place. I have a sponsor and attend meetings regularly as well as attend IOP three nights/ week. I'm working thru the steps right now and trying to better my connection with my higher power. 
Just wanted to let anyone that is struggling right now that it does get better as long as you keep doing the next right thing. Living on an altruistic plane is among one my biggest goals right now. Trust me, if I can do this...anyone can.

 post: What's up guys? Today I have a little over nine months clean from IV heroin. It's been a long journey since I started, and I'm finally getting it right this time around.
 I know everyone isn't a big fan of the 12step programs but AA worked for me. Since I moved to Florida completely turned my life around. This time last year I was sitting in inpatient back in the Chicago area. Now I'm working a 9-5 job in sales making over $60k annually. Instead of robbing my friends and family for money now im financing a beautiful car and living in a gated community with a pool right outside my apartment. I am 100% independent and fully self supporting. 
My point of posting this isn't to brag. I just want to show others who are in early recovery and/or struggling to show there is hope. Im achieving my dreams. I was hopeless for so long. I lost everything. I was spiritually and financially broken, but, I turned my life around. It was hard work but I can truly say that I am grateful for this disease I have today.

i work in the office in the back on a computer and i am sure he is jealous of my job which appears much easier. also another guy along with him has started doing this as well. It is embarrassing and makes me look bad

Also when they pass my desk, they will say ""wake up!"" or clap there hand loudly. Sometimes i appear sleepy and sometimes i kinda nod, nothing horrible and not every second. I am sober off illegal substances but take 70mg methadone and it makes me tired so i have to drink coffee daily. I know i should not let it bother me but it does cause it draws attention to me which i do not want or need. 

Today i went to the front and said to another guy , ""i respect you as a person because you do not push peoples buttons"" then the annoying guy says ""what he means is that ..."" i didn't pay attention so didn't hear what he said. He then went on to say something like he is just watching out for me? and doesn't want me to get a DWI??? 

What a joke. the dude is 30 something but acts like a child. there is no need for this. How should i respond to this situation.

 post: so my boyfriend and i picked up yesterday. we've been on a binge, foolishly, as we're both on paper.  i had just gotten off work at 9 and had to be back in at 3 am to cover someone so i was napping while my boyfriend got our shit.  then we were gonna head about 40 minutes out of town to get our subs for the week. so he just got 40, our usual to split. our dude usually has decent enough stuff. when he gave it to my bf he's like ""man be careful with this shit, it's fire"". yeah, yeah ok. honestly, shit usually sucks when he makes a disclaimer like that. my boyfriend did his and woke me up probably twenty minutes later to do mine. did it, it didn't taste strong but it burnt like crazy. also, we only snort. so we get to the top of this hill and stop at a stop sign and my boyfriend just slumps and the car started rolling backwards. i thought he was fucking with me as he likes to do. so i'm just like ha babe, quit. no response.



i start screaming his name. nothing. slapping his face nothing. full on panic mode at this point, so i call 911 while jumping on his lap to get the car under control and off the road. i somehow managed to not back into the giant ditch i was inches from. somehow an emt makes it to us in literally like five minutes. it's all a blur but i know he got there quick as fuck, i was still on the line with the operator when dude pulled open the driver door and starts trying to revive my bf. apparently in ohio emergency responders don't carry narcan so he was just beating on his chest and checking his pulse. i was freaking out so bad, screaming, begging, crying. the cops show up and are giving me the ""you shouldn't date drug addict losers"" spiel. like, really? can we see if he lives first? i guess they lost my boyfriend's pulse completely for about 11 seconds before they woke him up and stabilized him. 



the one officer who ended up dealing with me was awesome, though. he handed me back the unlabeled bottle of xanax and ultrams i had and tells me to put it somewhere safe. then it turns out my bf's license is suspended (we didn't know) and i knew mine was, so they were gonna tow the car. well the officer let me make some frantic calls and waited about a half hour with me for my bf's parents to show up and take the car for us. he just talked to me and tried to calm and reassure me in the meantime. seriously, he was awesome. and when i explained to him that i had jumped over to stop the car he made the other officers drop the failure to control charge they were gonna hit him with. of course he still got cited for dus, but that's understandable. 



i have no idea why he fell out and i didn't. i can't even properly remember my high because it was all adrenaline and panic. maybe that's what saved me. it was hard to convince the police we didn't shoot up. they searched my car, my purse; they checked me for track marks, and they checked the surrounding area for a rig before they were satisfied with my insistence that we had snorted it. i don't know if it was fent or what. we've done triple the amount, easily, in one sitting. more than triple. 



i go to the hospital with bf's mom. she's also telling me i shouldn't be with my bf, that he's dragging me down, etc (if she only knew. it's always my idea to break from subs. always) his dad was crying. that was rough, they have an extremely strained relationship. we are so selfish in this lifestyle, intentionally or not. but then i got to see my gorgeous, dazed, confused, not dead boyfriend and i've never felt relief like that in my life. it physically washed over me like a tidal wave. it was staggering. goddamn, i am so happy he's alive. i've felt uneasy and anxious all day so i wanted to write this down. i never thought one of us would od since we don't shoot up and we can never afford to do crazy big amounts in one sitting. i was so fucking terrified when that ambulance pulled away, my heart was in there with him. i am so lucky and thankful that i got them both back.



so then i got to go to work and act like i didn't just watch my boyfriend od. that didn't really work out, but whatever. this all happened about 24 hours ago and i am so content to be sitting here on subs, not dope, waiting on these cinnamon rolls with the love of my life. be careful, guys.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 post: i've been clean for two months today. the most noticeable difference is the perpetual dark circles are gone from my eyes. i know two months isn't a long time, but i just thought i'd feel different. maybe it's because it's court ordered sobriety. maybe it's because my treatment costs more than my dope did.  i haven't been sober from any and all substances in twelve years. that's half my life. i guess i should try to be patient. na creeps me out. my boyfriend is on subs. he doesn't like when i talk about my feelings. it reminds him of how badly i've hurt his own. i know this sub isn't for recovery. i'm just having a sleepless night wondering why sobriety is worth it when life is just as stressful as it was on the other side. i don't have any friends to talk to, i'm the only one that managed to turn into a junkie. i thought i'd be grateful when sleep finally came back, but now i just have bad dreams. i hate how hungry i am all the time. i haven't felt self loathing like this in a long time. not this strongly anyway.  i want to go home, but i don't have one. i really don't have a clue who i am without drugs.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: so the county igot in trouble in does not have an official drug court. however the judge on my case is new and really wants to start one. she has mr and about six other girls meet with her once a week for a drug test and a chat. it's kind of bizarre, but i'm not in jail so whatever. anyway, i've really stayed sober since being released since i get dropped three times a week.  she met with me and one other girl yesterday and said she wanted us to be mentors or something to that effect once the drug court is an official program of the county. i guess if i'm on papers idon't really have a choice but i don't really feel qualified to mentor anybody. i've only been sober shy of four months and it's only because it's court ordered. once my year is done with and my felony is dropped i really hope she doesn't expect me to stick around. maybe i'll feel differently when i have a year of sobriety. i don't really know the point of this post but it just kind of makes me laugh where i'm at in life. she says she chose me because i have my shit together more than most of the girls. i told her that her standards must be pretty low because that's literally all i have going for me right now - sobriety. no job, no license, living with boyfriend's family. in drug court and iop when i didn't even catch a drug charge. i guess my point is i regret moving to that backwards ass county and catching a charge there.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 post: i literally thought he was joking when he told me. like, no really babe, what'd you get. it's his own fault of course. he just quit going to probation. but i didn't expect him to get maxed out. he's had incredible luck through his life in terms of jail and legal shit and it just finally ran out  the judge had no sympathy. 

we live with his grandma who has alzheimer's and dementia. he did everything to take care of her. i am scared as fuck. she doesn't remember me when i come home from work. she keeps asking where he is. i don't know how to deal with her. i know how to feed her and make sure she takes her medicine. but beyond that i'm lost.

he caught the original charge two years ago when we were deepest into our addiction and stealing massive amounts of copper from his job. in reality we're fortunate to have not been caught with the true extent of what we took. i'm just wrapping up my nine months of outpatient treatment as a result of the same case. in a sense it's probably good. i got clean for the first time since eating a script of percs six years ago. i stayed completely sober for nine months (including my jail time) and we have been partying every other weekend now that my drug tests are less strict. the first thing he said after he told me his sentence was ""baby, please don't fucking od while i'm gone."" that killed me. i know that fear because it was my biggest one when i was locked up. getting a call that he was dead. this will be the longest he's been clean in fifteen years. he's been on subs for about four. he's never been truly sober. i hope he benefits from it. that we both do.

 post: im a week off of heroin today, but on sub's. today is the first time i woke up feeling relatively human. never had so much trouble switching to suboxone before and that's probably a large reason why relapse never was a big deal. ill just spiral out a bit then get on subs, rinse, repeat. couldn't tell ya why but that's apparently not an option before. 

ive had so many close calls with this shit. the day i learned what pwd was, i had an interview for a promotion. i got the job, but the pwd started as i was being interviewed. ended up not showing up for work for two days because i was so sick until i figured out what was going on. my solution was to just stay on heroin.

that was about six months ago. my habit along with my boyfriend's became unsustainable quickly. he went to jail two weeks ago so i promised him id suck it up and be on subs by the time he got out. we tried a few times in the previous months but we could never hold out long enough to avoid the pwd; one of us always caved.

well i did it and it sucked but i welcome the feeling of relief knowing i don't have to come up with $100/day give or take, you know. didn't really stop in time to avoid some utilities getting shut off and a possible red tag on my car but im hoping it'll all shake out at some point. it always does if i keep my nose clean. and this time i get to smoke weed and not be on probation, so that's a plus.

i have a great job with plenty of oppurtunity to move up and make a decent living for a drug addict college drop out. i like it there and i don't want to fuck it up as ive done repeatedly in my past.

no point to this except to talk about it. i want to be on the other side where stuff is fixed, but it'll be a minute. got my boy at the sub clinic now so we can stay well, put gas in my car and eat until i get paid. and we will trudge along as always.",q0,0,0,0,0,0,"1,0",2,0,0,0

 post: this is long, basic question is at the bottom, the rest is some back story.

i got clean for a year after eightish years of pill and heroin use. relapsed, and this time around subs are not the lifesaver they used to be. i think i've managed to learn how to avoid the pwd every time now, cause that was a new problem as well.


but they just don't take all the sickness away. they definitely make me feel better, just not 100%. if i eat like two whole strips i get relief for a really short amount of time, maybe six hours max. four mg used to have me set for a full 24 hours. and that's during heavier use than now. 


anyway, im high and rambling but we've been trying to hop off dope and stick to subs for a few months now and we cave everytime cause we feel like complete shit. when the subs are effective it eliminates cravings, duh that's the point, but when you're on 12mg and still feel like poop, it's hard. willpower is hard.


my question is: would kratom with the suboxone take the edge off? i'm fairly confident if we could stay on the damn things our tolerance or whatever would level out and we'd be gravy. the longest we've managed to go is eight days. we're both fairly motivated to get off this shit, super tired of being broke. plus today's the first time in a while that we've gotten shit that does more than keep us unsick.


so. would kratom be effective in combination with suboxone, and if not are there any suggestions for our predicament?


sorry this is long, this is the highest i've been in forever. and it's real dope, not fuck ass fentanyl or whatever cut to shit.

thanks!

 post: boyfriend and i donated plasma this morning at like 7am before the dope sickness kicked in. something happened with their system and the money didn't get loaded onto our cards alllll fucking day. i was so salty and we were sick as fuck. finally around 7pm the money came through on his so we headed to the spot. when we were there one of the dope boys who owes us money (he wrecked my car) was there. finally paid some more of his tab. in dope of course, which doesn't help my car, but so it goes. so got our 30 then 100 for free. 

on our way back into town i checked my card, and someone fucked up at the plasma center,  so instead of 50 for donating i got 108. not even sure how that happened, i assume they kept trying to load the cards when it wasn't working but idk where the extra 8 came from. don't care. THEN we're at the gas station and my bf finds twenty dollars on the ground. THEN we run into his cousin who we had asked to loan us 20 weeks ago and she asks if we still want it. of course we do!

so, started out today broke and sick. ended up with almost $200 of free dope and enough cash to get me to payday. it's been a while since so much good fortune has bestowed us so i felt compelled to share. fucking full moon, man. i hope some good shit happens to you lovely people too!
